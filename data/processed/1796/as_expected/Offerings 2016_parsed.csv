Our fiscal year ends on June 30 of each year. Fiscal years are identified in this offering circular according to the calendar year in which they end. For example, the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 is referred to as “fiscal year 2015.” Unless otherwise specified, all references in this offering circular to years are to fiscal years. The Issuers of the notes offered hereby will be Solera, LLC and Solera Finance, Inc., entities that were formed in connection with the Transactions. Neither Solera, LLC nor Solera Finance, Inc. has any assets or operations other than their indirect ownership of 100% of the capital stock of Merger Sub. Because the assets and operations of the Issuers following the Merger will consist of their ownership of Solera and its subsidiaries, the consolidated financial information included in this offering circular is financial information of Solera and its consolidated subsidiaries. There are no audited financial statements of the Issuers for any periods in this offering circular. Unless otherwise stated herein, pro forma financial information gives effect to the Transactions, as described under “Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Pro Forma Financial Information.” Numerical figures included in this offering circular have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, numerical figures shown as totals in various tables may not be arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them. We have not included in this offering circular any separate financial statements for the guarantors or a footnote to Solera’s consolidated financial statements showing condensed consolidating financial information for Solera, the guarantors and our non-guarantor subsidiaries as would be required if we were registering the notes with the SEC. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our nonguarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $622.5 million, or 51.9%, of our revenues, and approximately $293.5 million, or 63.9%, of our Adjusted EBITDA. Excluding the effect of intercompany balances as well as intercompany transactions, our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $1,231.1 million, or 33.2%, of our total assets, and approximately $251.5 million, or 6.9%, of our total liabilities, in each case as of December 31, 2015. We have calculated the foregoing amounts on an historic basis without giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, including the application of purchase accounting, because we have not completed the required allocation of the estimated purchase price to our net tangible and intangible assets held by each subsidiary. We do not expect that this allocation will be completed until after the completion of the Transactions. Unless the context otherwise requires, this offering circular assumes the Merger has been consummated. vi -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,364
1796,Offerings 2016.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"We believe that the financial statements included in this offering circular have been prepared in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and the regulations published by the SEC, and are consistent with current practice with the exception of the presentation of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and net debt, the inclusion of financial data for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, including pro forma financial data, and the omission of certain financial information regarding the guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries. Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and net debt as presented in this offering circular are supplemental measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. These are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenues, net income, income before income tax provision, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to total debt or cash flow from operations or any other measure of our liquidity. These measures are not intended to be measures of free cash flow available for management’s discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. In addition, our method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow may vary from the method used by other companies. Our management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be a key indicator of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. We also believe that investors, analysts and rating agencies consider Adjusted EBITDA a useful means of measuring our ability to meet our debt service obligations and evaluating our financial performance, and management uses this measurement for one or more of these purposes. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. The use of Adjusted EBITDA instead of net income has limitations as an analytical tool, including the following: ‰ Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; ‰ Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; ‰ Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; ‰ Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; ‰ Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and ‰ Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments that represented a cash expense or that represented a non-cash charge that may relate to a future cash expense, and some of these expenses are of a type that we expect to incur in the future, although we cannot predict the amount of any such future charge. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a replacement for net income or as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to service our indebtedness or invest in our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only for supplemental purposes. vii ----- In this offering circular, we also present pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, which further adjusts Adjusted EBITDA to also include adjustments for ongoing waste elimination, compensation adjustments, annualized EBITDA of Recent Acquisitions, pro forma margin impact from Recent Acquisitions and planned restructuring initiatives and public company cost savings. See note (6) to “Summary—Summary Condensed Consolidated Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data.” Our management considers Free Cash Flow and net debt to be key indicators of our liquidity. Additionally, we believe Free Cash Flow and net debt are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. We also believe that investors, analysts and rating agencies consider Free Cash Flow and net debt a useful means of measuring our ability to meet our debt service obligations and evaluating our liquidity, and management uses these measurements for one or more of these purposes. Our presentation of Free Cash Flow and net debt should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Free Cash Flow and net debt have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, Free Cash Flow and net debt should not be considered as a replacement for cash flow from operations or total debt or as a measure of our liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Free Cash Flow and net debt only for supplemental purposes.

Proprietary Databases that are Difficult to Replicate._** We believe that our proprietary databases pose barriers to entry due to the significant capital investment and time that would be required to develop a similar set of integrated databases and customize them for use in local markets. Our proprietary databases have been built over 45 years of developing, collecting, organizing and managing automobile-related information and data. Over the last five years, we have invested over $100 million annually, including $135 million in fiscal year 2015, to maintain and expand our proprietary databases and related software applications, including customizing our databases for use in local markets. Our databases cover more than 98% of the vehicles on the road today in our core markets dating back to 1970.

To the extent that our cash and cash equivalents balance at the time of the closing of the Transactions is greater than $480.0 million, such additional cash and cash equivalents will be used to fund the Transactions, and the cash equity contribution described in footnote (5) above will be reduced by the difference between the cash balance at closing used to fund the Transactions and $480.0 million. To the extent that our cash and cash equivalents balance at the time of the closing of the Transactions is less than $480.0 million, the cash equity contribution described in footnote (5) above will be increased by the difference between the cash balance at closing used to fund the Transactions and $480.0 million.

From and after the consummation of the Merger, the notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Issuer’s existing and future restricted subsidiaries to the extent such subsidiary guarantees the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or certain syndicated bank debt and capital markets debt securities. The note guarantees of any guarantor will be released in the event such guarantor’s guarantee under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities is released. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” Ranking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes and the note guarantees will be the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ senior unsecured obligations and will: - rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuers and the guarantors; - rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuers and the guarantors, including obligations under any remaining Existing Notes outstanding following consummation of the Tender Offers; - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the Issuers and the guarantors, including indebtedness under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and - be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness and other claims and liabilities (including trade payables) of any non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuers. 22 ----- As of December 31, 2015, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds,” (1) the notes and the note guarantees would have ranked effectively junior to approximately $2,200.0 million of secured indebtedness consisting of borrowings under our New Term Loan Facility and (2) we would have had additional unused availability under our New Revolving Facility of $300.0 million. We also can incur additional secured indebtedness if certain specified conditions are met under the credit agreements that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby. As of December 31, 2015, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would not have had any indebtedness (excluding intercompany liabilities). Our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $622.5 million, or 51.9%, of our revenues, and approximately $293.5 million, or 63.9%, of our Adjusted EBITDA, in each case for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the effect of intercompany balances as well as intercompany transactions, our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $1,231.1 million, or 33.2%, of our total assets, and approximately $251.5 million, or 6.9%, of our total liabilities, in each case as of December 31, 2015. Optional Redemption. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time prior to March 1, 2019 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a “makewhole premium,” as described under “Description of Notes— Optional Redemption.” At any time on or after March 1, 2019, we may redeem some or all of the notes at the applicable redemption prices described under “Description of Notes— Optional Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. Additionally, from time to time prior to March 1, 2019, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a redemption price equal to 110.500% of the principal amount thereof, plus (i) an amount equal to or less than the net cash proceeds that we raise in one or more equity offerings, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. For more information, see “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” 23 ----- Tax Redemption. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We may redeem the notes in whole, but not in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date in certain circumstances in which the Issuers or guarantors would become obligated to pay additional amounts. See “Description of Notes—Redemption of Notes for Tax Reasons.” Payment of Additional Amounts . . . . . In the event that withholding taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from payments on the notes or a guarantee thereof after the occurrence of a European Domicile Transaction (as defined in “Description of Notes—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”), the Issuers or the guarantors will, subject to certain exceptions, pay such additional amounts as will result, after deduction or withholding of such taxes, in the payment of the amounts which would have been payable in respect of such notes or the guarantees thereof had no such withholding or deduction been required. See “Description of Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts on the Notes.” Original Issue Discount. . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will be treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for United States federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between their stated principal amount and their issue price. As a result, a holder subject to United States federal income taxation will be required to include the OID in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis), in advance of the receipt of the corresponding cash payments, regardless of such holder’s regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. See “Certain United States Federal Tax Considerations.” Change of Control Offer . . . . . . . . . . . . Upon the occurrence of certain kinds of changes of control, you will have the right, as holders of the notes, to require us to repurchase some or all of your notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the repurchase date. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders— Change of Control.” We may not be able to pay you the required price for notes you present to us at the time of a change of control, because: - we may not have enough funds at that time; or - the terms of our indebtedness under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities may prevent us from making such payment. 24 ----- See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—We may not be able to purchase the notes upon a change of control, which would result in a default under the indenture that will govern the notes and would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.” Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The indenture that will govern the notes will contain covenants that, among other things, will limit the Issuers’ ability and the ability of the Issuers’ restricted subsidiaries to: - incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; - incur liens or use assets as security in other transactions; - make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments; - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and - merge or consolidate or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications as described under “Description of Notes— Certain Covenants.” Many of these covenants will cease to apply to each series of notes during any time that the notes of each series have investment grade ratings from both Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”) and no default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture that will govern the notes. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.” Transfer Restrictions; No Registration Rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes and the note guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state or other securities laws, and we are under no obligation to so register the notes. The notes are subject to restrictions on transfer and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, except that holders will not be permitted to transfer the notes in reliance on Rule 144 even after the applicable holding period has been satisfied. See “Transfer Restrictions.” We do not intend to issue registered notes and note guarantees in exchange for the notes and the note guarantees to be placed in this offering, and the absence of registration rights may adversely impact the transferability of the notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the notes under applicable securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer and resell the notes without registration under applicable securities laws.” 25 ----- No Prior Market; Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will be new securities for which there is currently no market. Although the initial purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the notes, they are not obligated to do so, and they may discontinue market making activities at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the notes will develop or, if such a market develops, that it will be maintained. The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. Use of Proceeds. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We intend to use the net proceeds from the notes offered hereby, together with the certain equity investments and the proceeds from initial borrowings under the New Term Loan Facility, to finance the Merger and pay related fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.” Risk Factors. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Investing in the notes involves risks. You should consider carefully the information set forth in “Risk Factors” and all other information contained in this offering circular before deciding to invest in the notes. 26 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

We have derived the summary condensed consolidated historical financial data as of June 30, 2013, 2014 and 2015 and for the fiscal years then ended from our audited consolidated financial statements for such years. We have derived the summary condensed consolidated historical financial data as of December 31, 2014 and 2015 and for the six-month periods then ended from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for such periods, which contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations for the periods presented. Operating results for the six-month periods are not necessarily indicative of results for a full fiscal year, or any other periods. Our audited consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2014 and 2015 and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2014 and 2015 and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and for the six-month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 are included elsewhere in this offering circular and do not reflect the impact of the Transactions. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) data for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 have been derived by adding the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) data for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) data for the six months ended December 31, 2015 and subtracting the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) data for the six months ended December 31, 2014. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) data give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as if they had occurred on July 1, 2014 and the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma balance sheet data give effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on December 31, 2015. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial data is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent our financial condition or our results of operations had the Transactions occurred on or as of the dates noted above or to project the results for any future date or period. The Merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The pro forma adjustments reflect adjustments required under GAAP for business combinations and are based upon, among other things, preliminary estimates of fair market values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Revisions to the preliminary estimates of fair market value may have a significant impact on the pro forma amounts of total assets, total liabilities and stockholders’ equity, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and income tax expense. 27 ----- 28 ----- 29 ----- 30 ----- 31 ----- 32 ----- matures on June 15, 2021 pursuant to which we pay quarterly floating coupon payments at 3-month LIBOR plus 3.924% and receive semi-annual fixed coupon payments at 6.000%. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized unrealized gains on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments of $40.5 million, which is included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). For additional information regarding our outstanding derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2015, see Note 10, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended December 31, 2015, included elsewhere in this offering circular. (12) The ratio of pro forma net debt to pro forma Adjusted EBITDA is determined by dividing the total debt as of December 31, 2015 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions (but without reduction for the expected original issue discount for the New Term Loan Facility, the original issue discount for the Notes offered hereby, or debt issuance costs to be paid to creditors in connection with the Transactions), net of cash and cash equivalents, by pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. We define net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, as total debt less cash and cash equivalents as of a particular date. Unaudited as adjusted net debt on a pro forma basis as of December 31, 2015 of $3,818 million gives effect to the Transactions as if such transactions were completed on that date (assuming $112.3 million of cash on the balance sheet on a pro forma basis). See “Capitalization.” (13) The pro forma cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 does not include $121.3 million relating to demands for approval that will be funded at closing, the additional $9.5 million of cash and cash equivalents that we expect to have on hand at the time of the closing of the Transactions or the additional $32.8 million that will need to be paid for accrued interest on the Existing Notes.

1796,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.1,"We depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in volume from, any of these customers would harm our financial results.","We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to large insurance companies and collision repair facilities that have relationships with these insurance companies. During fiscal year 2015 and the six months ended December 31, 2015, we derived 15.3% and 14.7% of our revenues, respectively, from our ten largest insurance company customers. The largest three of these customers accounted for 3.0%, 2.3% and 1.9%, respectively, of our revenues during fiscal year 2015 and 2.9%, 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively, of our revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2015. A loss of one or more of these customers would result in a significant decrease in our revenues, including the business generated by collision repair facilities associated with those customers. Furthermore, many of our arrangements with European customers are terminable by them on short notice or at any time. In addition, disputes with customers may lead to delays in payments to us, terminations of agreements or litigation. Additional terminations or non-renewals of customer contracts or reductions in business from our large customers would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364
1796,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.2,"Our industry is highly competitive, and our failure to compete effectively could result in a loss of customers and market share, which could harm our revenues and operating results.","The markets for our automobile insurance claims processing software and services are highly competitive. In the United States, our principal competitors are CCC Information Services Group Inc. and Mitchell International Inc. In Europe, our principal competitors are EurotaxGlass’s Group, DAT GmbH and GT Motive Einsa Group. Mitchell International recently consummated a strategic relationship with GT Motive Einsa Group, including an equity investment. We also encounter regional or country-specific competition in the markets for automobile insurance claims processing software and services and our other products and services. For example Experian[®] is our principal competitor in the United Kingdom in the vehicle validation market, car.tv is our principal competitor in Germany in the online salvage vehicle disposition market and ChoicePoint is our principal competitor in the United States in the automobile reunderwriting solutions market. The principal competitors of SRS in the U.S. service, repair and maintenance software and solutions market are ALLDATA and the Mitchell repair manuals. The principal competitor of our I&S business is Safelite Solutions and the principal competitors to CAP are Kee Resources and Glass’s Guide. If one or more of our competitors develop software or services that are superior to ours or are more effective in marketing their software or services, our market share could decrease, thereby reducing our revenues. In addition, if one or more of our competitors retain existing or attract new customers for which we have developed new software or services, we may not realize expected revenues from these new offerings, thereby reducing our profitability. Some of our current or future competitors may have or develop closer customer relationships, develop stronger brands, have greater access to capital, lower cost structures and/or more attractive 34 ----- system design and operational capabilities than we have. Consolidation within our industry could result in the formation of competitors with substantially greater financial, management or marketing resources than we have, and such competitors could utilize their substantially greater resources and economies of scale in a manner that affects our ability to compete in the relevant market or markets. As a result of consolidation, our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs, devote greater resources to promoting or selling their products and services, initiate and withstand substantial price competition, expand into new markets, hire away our key employees, change or limit access to key information and systems, take advantage of acquisition or other strategic opportunities more readily and develop and expand their product and service offerings (including those products and services that may compete with our risk and asset management platform and our “digital garage” product) more quickly than we can. In addition, our competitors may form strategic or exclusive relationships with each other, such as the equity interest in GT Motive Einsa Group purchased by Mitchell International, and with other companies in attempts to compete more successfully against us. These relationships may increase our competitors’ ability, relative to ours, to address customer needs with their software and service offerings, which may enable them to rapidly increase their market share. Moreover, many insurance companies have historically entered into agreements with automobile insurance claims processing service providers like us and our competitors whereby the insurance company agrees to use that provider on an exclusive or preferred basis for particular products and services and agrees to require collision repair facilities, independent assessors and other vendors to use that provider. If our competitors are more successful than we are at negotiating these exclusive or preferential arrangements, we may lose market share even in markets where we retain other competitive advantages. In addition, our insurance company customers have varying degrees of in-house development capabilities, and one or more of them have expanded and may seek to further expand their capabilities in the areas in which we operate. Many of our customers are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do and could commit significant resources to product development. Our software and services have been, and may in the future be, replicated by our insurance company customers in-house, which could result in our loss of those customers and their associated repair facilities, independent assessors and other vendors, resulting in decreased revenues and net income.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364
1796,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.3,The time and expense associated with switching from our competitors’ software and services to ours may limit our growth.,"The costs for an insurance company to switch providers of claims processing software and services can be significant and the process can sometimes take 12 to 18 months to complete. As a result, potential customers may decide that it is not worth the time and expense to begin using our software and services, even if we offer competitive and economic advantages. If we are unable to convince these customers to switch to our software and services, our ability to increase market share will be limited and could harm our revenues and operating results.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364
1796,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.4,Our operating results may be subject to volatility as a result of exposure to foreign currency exchange risks.,"We derive most of our revenues, and incur most of our costs, in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, mainly the Euro. In our historical financial statements, we translate our local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period for our consolidated statement of income and certain components of stockholders’ equity or the exchange rate at the end of that period for the consolidated balance sheet. These translations resulted in a net foreign currency translation adjustment of $(167.7) million and $39.1 million for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, 35 ----- respectively, and $24.1 million and $99.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders’ equity. Ongoing global economic conditions have impacted currency exchange rates. Exchange rates between most of the major foreign currencies we use to transact our business and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate. The majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in Euros, Pound Sterling, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars and other foreign currencies. The following table provides the average quarterly exchange rates for the Euro and Pound Sterling since the beginning of fiscal year 2015:",N/A,as_expected,2016,364
1796,Offerings 2016.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Average Pound Sterling-to- U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate Period Average Euro- to-U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate,13.2.1,"Current uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict product demand, utilization and other related matters and makes it more likely that our actual results could differ materially from expectations.","Our operations and performance depend on worldwide economic conditions, which have deteriorated significantly in many countries where our products and services are sold, and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. These conditions make it difficult for our customers and potential customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and could cause our customers and potential customers to slow, reduce or refrain from spending on our products. In addition, external factors that affect our business have been and may continue to be impacted by the global economic slowdown. Examples include: ‰ Number of Insurance Claims Made: In fiscal year 2015, the number of insurance claims made increased slightly versus fiscal year 2014. However, in several of our large western European markets, the number of insurance claims for vehicle damage submitted by owners to their insurance carriers declined slightly. The number of insurance claims made can be influenced by factors such as unemployment levels, the number of miles driven, rising gasoline prices, the number of uninsured drivers, rising insurance premiums and insured drivers opting for lower coverage or higher deductible levels, among other things. Fewer claims made can reduce the transaction-based fees that we generate. ‰ Sales of New and Used Vehicles: According to industry sources, global new vehicle sales grew by 3.6% in 2014 to 86.3 million units and sales are forecasted to reach 88.4 million units, up by 2.4%, in 2015. In Advanced Markets, sales are projected to grow at a 0.7% CAGR from 2014 through 2024. In other markets, sales are projected to grow at a 6.6% CAGR from 2014 through 2024. Fewer new light vehicle sales can result in fewer insured vehicles on the road and fewer automobile accidents, which can reduce the transaction-based fees that we generate. ‰ Used Vehicle Retail and Wholesale Values: Declines in retail and wholesale used vehicle values can impact vehicle owner and insurance carrier decisions about which damaged vehicles should be repaired and which should be declared a total loss. The lower the retail and wholesale used vehicle values, the more likely it is that a greater percentage of automobiles are declared a total loss versus a partial loss. The fewer number of vehicles that owners and insurance carriers decide to repair can reduce the transaction-based fees that we generate for partial-loss estimates, but may have a beneficial impact on the transaction-based fees that we generate for total-loss estimates. ‰ Automobile Usage-Number of Miles Driven: Several factors can influence miles driven, including gasoline prices and economic conditions. According to industry sources, for calendar year 2014, cumulative miles driven in the United States increased by 2.6% compared to the same period in the prior year. For calendar year 2013, cumulative miles driven in the United States remained flat compared to the same period in the prior year. Fewer miles driven can result in fewer automobile accidents, which can reduce the transaction-based fees that we generate. Many of our markets around the world continue to experience or have recently experienced volatility. Accordingly, we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or 38 ----- subsequent economic recovery, worldwide or in particular economic markets. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for or utilization of our products and on our financial condition and operating results.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

We have addressed and will continue to address the need to introduce new products both through internal development and through acquisitions of other companies and technologies that would complement or extend our business or enhance our technological capability. In fiscal year 2015, we acquired six businesses, including I&S and CAP, and substantially all of the assets of another business. In fiscal year 2016 to date, we acquired one business, and substantially all of the assets of another business and the remaining 50% equity ownership interest in SRS. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend, to a varying extent, on our ability to continue to expand the acquired business’ products and services and integrate them with our products and services. Our management will be required to devote significant attention and resources to these efforts, which may disrupt our core business, the acquired business or both and, if executed ineffectively, could preclude realization of the full benefits we expect. Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the operations of the acquired business. In addition, the efforts required to realize the benefits of our acquisitions may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and the diversion of management’s attention, and may cause our stock price to decline. The risks associated with our acquisitions and future acquisitions include: ‰ adverse effects on existing customer or supplier relationships, such as cancellation of orders or the loss of key customers or suppliers; ‰ difficulties in integrating or retaining key employees of the acquired company; ‰ difficulties in integrating the operations of the acquired company, such as information technology resources, and financial and operational data; ‰ entering geographic or product markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; ‰ difficulties in assimilating product lines or integrating technologies of the acquired company into our products; ‰ disruptions to our operations; ‰ diversion of our management’s attention; ‰ potential incompatibility of business cultures; ‰ potential dilution to existing stockholders if we issue shares of common stock or other securities as consideration in an acquisition or if we issue any such securities to finance acquisitions; ‰ prohibitions against completing acquisitions as a result of regulatory restrictions or disruptions in connection with regulatory investigations of completed acquisitions; ‰ limitations on the use of net operating losses or tax benefits; ‰ negative market perception, which could negatively affect our stock price; ‰ the assumption of debt and other liabilities, both known and unknown; and ‰ additional expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets or impairment charges related to purchased intangibles and goodwill, or write-offs, if any, recorded as a result of the acquisition. 39 ----- Many of these factors will be outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy. Our merger and acquisition activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions. If we were found to violate antitrust and competition laws, we would be subject to various remedies, including divestiture of the acquired businesses. We participate in joint ventures in some countries and may participate in future joint ventures. Our partners in these ventures may have interests and goals that are inconsistent with or different from ours, which could result in the joint venture taking actions that negatively impact our growth in the local market and consequently harm our business or financial condition. If we are unable to find suitable partners or if suitable partners are unwilling to enter into joint ventures with us, our growth into new geographic markets may slow, which would harm our results of operations. Additionally, we may finance future acquisitions, and/or additional joint ventures with cash from operations, additional indebtedness and/or the issuance of additional securities, any of which may impair the operation of our business or present additional risks, such as reduced liquidity, or increased interest expense. We may also seek to restructure our business in the future by disposing of certain of our assets, which may harm our future operating results, divert significant managerial attention from our operations and/or require us to accept non-cash consideration, the market value of which may fluctuate.

In addition, we incur significant operating expenses while we are researching and designing new software and related services, and we typically do not receive corresponding payments in those same periods. As a result, the number of new software and service offerings that we are able to implement, successfully or otherwise, can cause significant variations in our cash flow from operations, and we may experience a decrease in our net income as we incur the expenses necessary to develop and design new software and services. Accordingly, our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Our business is subject to seasonal and other fluctuations. In particular, we have historically experienced higher revenues during the second quarter and third quarter versus the first quarter and fourth quarter during each fiscal year. This seasonality is caused primarily by more days of inclement weather during the second quarter and third quarter in most of our markets, which contributes to a greater number of vehicle accidents and damage during these periods. In addition, our business is subject to fluctuations caused by other factors, including the occurrence of extraordinary weather events and the timing of certain public holidays. For example, the Easter holiday occurs during the third quarter in certain fiscal years and occurs during the fourth quarter in other fiscal years, resulting in a change in the number of business days during the quarter in which the holiday occurs. We anticipate that our revenues will continue to be subject to seasonality and therefore our financial results will vary from period to period. However, actual results from operations may or may not follow these normal seasonal patterns in a given year leading to performance that is not in alignment with expectations. 40 ----- We also may experience variations in our earnings due to other factors beyond our control, such as: ‰ the introduction of new software or services by our competitors; ‰ customer acceptance of new software or services; ‰ the volume of usage of our offerings by existing customers; ‰ variations of vehicle accident rates due to factors such as changes in fuel prices, number of miles driven or new vehicle purchases and their impact on vehicle usage; ‰ competitive conditions, or changes in competitive conditions, in our industry generally; ‰ prolonged system failures during which time customers cannot submit or process transactions; or ‰ prolonged interruptions in our access to third-party data incorporated in our software and services.

The development or adaptation of these new technologies and products may result in unanticipated expenditures and capital costs that would not be recovered in the event that such new technologies or products are unsuccessful.

Also, we are subject to direct regulation in some markets, and our failure to comply with these regulations could significantly reduce our revenues or subject us to government sanctions. In addition, future regulations could force us to implement costly changes to our software and/or databases or have the effect of prohibiting or rendering less valuable one or more of our offerings. Moreover, some states in the United States have changed and are contemplating changes to their regulations to permit insurance companies to use book valuations or public source valuations for total loss calculations, making our total loss software potentially less valuable to insurance companies in those states. Some states have adopted total loss regulations that, among other things, require insurers to use a methodology deemed acceptable to the respective government agency. We submit our methodology to such agencies, and if they do not approve our methodology, we will not be able to perform total loss valuations in their respective states. Other states are considering legislation that would limit the data that our software can provide to our insurance company customers.

On October 22, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the holding of our shareholder meeting based upon his claim that our public disclosures were inadequate. On November 5, 2015, the Court denied the motion for expedited proceedings, and declined to consider plaintiff’s motion seeking to enjoin the special meeting. The defendants deny any wrongdoing in connection with the merger and plan to defend vigorously against the claims set forth in the amended complaint and any injunction motion. On November 17, 2015, a duplicative action was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against our directors on behalf of the same putative class of the Company’s stockholders, alleging similar claims for breach of fiduciary duty and challenging the Merger and the disclosures relating to the Merger. On December 23, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action. On January 29, 2016, the Court entered an order consolidating the two related cases for all purposes, appointing a lead plaintiff and lead counsel, and granting lead plaintiff until 20 days following the closing of the Merger to file any consolidated amended complaint. The defendants deny any wrongdoing in connection with the Merger and plan to defend vigorously against the claims set forth in these actions. Furthermore, we are also subject to assertions by our customers and strategic partners that we have not complied with the terms of our agreements with them or that the agreements are not enforceable against them, some of which are the subject of pending litigation and any of which could in the future lead to arbitration or litigation.

If these appraisal demands are not withdrawn or determined to be invalid, or do not otherwise cease under Delaware law, the claims represented by such appraisal demands will constitute a substantial contingent liability of ours and will also result in our incurring substantial interest charges until they are resolved.","Holders of shares of Solera common stock who did not vote in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger and who properly demanded appraisal of their shares and who otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) will be entitled to seek appraisal for, and obtain payment in cash for the judicially determined “fair value” (as defined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL) of, their shares in lieu of receiving the Acquisition Consideration if the Merger is completed, but only if they comply with all applicable requirements of Delaware law. This appraised value could be more than, the same as, or less than the Acquisition Consideration of $55.85 per share. As of February 26, 2016, we have received purported demands for appraisal with respect to approximately 7,149,364 shares. Upon completion of the Merger, we expect to record a liability of $55.85 for each share with respect to which appraisal has been properly demanded (representing approximately $399.3 million if appraisal has been properly demanded with respect to all of the approximately 7,149,364 shares for 51 ----- which appraisal demands have purported to have been delivered as of February 26, 2016). In addition, we anticipate incurring interest charges equal to a per annum rate (compounded quarterly) of 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) in respect of such liability. At any time during the 60-day period after the Effective Time, any stockholder who has not actually commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined an appraisal proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal, in which event we will be obligated to promptly pay to such stockholder the Acquisition Consideration of $55.85 per share in cash, without interest. After such 60-day period, any demand for appraisal can be withdrawn only with our approval and, if an appraisal proceeding has been commenced, with the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, we or any holder of our shares who properly has exercised its appraisal rights may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders exercising appraisal rights. If no such petition is filed within that 120-day period, all appraisal rights will cease, and we will be required to promptly pay the Acquisition Consideration of $55.85 per share in cash, without interest, to all stockholders who exercised appraisal rights. If an appraisal proceeding is commenced within 120 days after the Effective Time, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Chancery Court. Through such proceeding, the court shall determine the fair value of the shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger. Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on such fair value from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at a per annum rate of 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time. It has not been unusual for appraisal proceedings in the Court of Chancery to take several years from the merger effective date to be concluded by a judgment, although there is no assurance as to the actual timing of any such proceeding. At the conclusion of an appraisal proceeding, the Court of Chancery directs the corporation surviving the merger to pay the fair value, plus any interest. Upon a stockholder filing a petition for appraisal, we can settle with the stockholder following approval of the Delaware Chancery Court. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors and the fair value so determined could be more than, the same as or less than the Acquisition Consideration. There is no assurance that the Delaware Court of Chancery will not determine that the fair value of the shares is materially greater than the Acquisition Consideration. Any payment in respect of the shares subject to appraisal rights will be required to be paid in cash.

The indenture that will govern the notes will allow any non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness in the future and will not limit the incurrence of liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. Furthermore, we may, under certain circumstances described in the indenture that will govern the notes, designate subsidiaries to be unrestricted subsidiaries, and any subsidiary that is designated as unrestricted will not guarantee the notes. Any right that the Issuers or the guarantors have to receive any assets of any non-guarantor subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of those subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of holders of the notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of those subsidiaries’ assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of those non-guarantor subsidiaries’ creditors, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests of those subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of any non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their debt, including their trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding indebtedness or guarantees issued by those subsidiaries, are generally entitled to payment on their claims from assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to us. As of December 31, 2015, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would not have had any indebtedness (excluding intercompany liabilities).

Additionally, under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, a change of control (as defined therein) constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the respective agreements and terminate their commitments to lend. The source of funds for any purchase of the notes and repayment of borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities would be our available cash or cash generated from other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds provided by our existing or new stockholders.

Under U.S. bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, which may vary from state to state, a court could void the issuance of the notes and/or a note guarantee or claims related to the notes or subordinate a note guarantee to all of our other debts or to all other debts of a guarantor if, among other things, we or a guarantor, at the time we or such guarantor incurred the indebtedness: ‰ intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; or ‰ received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the delivery of the notes or the guarantee, as the case may be, and if the Issuers or guarantor: - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence; - was engaged in a business or transaction for which the Issuers’ or the guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. In addition, a court could void any payment by a guarantor pursuant to the notes or a note guarantee and require that payment be returned to such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the guarantor. If the notes or note guarantees were avoided or limited under fraudulent transfer or other laws, any claim you may make against the Issuers or the guarantors for amounts payable on the notes would be unenforceable to the extent of such avoidance or limitation. Moreover, the court could order you to return any payments previously made by the Issuers or the guarantors. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the governing law in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, a party would be considered insolvent if: ‰ the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; ‰ the present fair saleable value of all of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or ‰ it could not pay its debts as they become due. We cannot be certain what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or, regardless of the standard, that a court would not avoid the notes or note guarantees. 58 ----- The indenture that will govern the notes will contain a “savings clause” intended to limit each guarantor’s liability under its guarantee to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer under applicable law.

(6) Represents the approximate cash preferred equity contribution to be made to Parent by BSPI and KSISH (all of the preferred equity financing provided to Parent will be contributed to the Issuer as common equity) and the approximate cash common equity contribution to be made by VEPFV and certain other investors arranged and/or designated by Vista. The cash common equity contribution is expected to be reduced by approximately $278.0 million, the Appraisal Demand Amount, which is not expected to be funded by Common Equity Investors at the closing of the Merger. The total equity and total capitalization will be reduced by the aggregate amount the Common Equity Investors elect not to fund. Approximately $121.3 million related to demands for appraisal will be funded at the closing of the Merger. (7) Excludes redeemable noncontrolling interests of $80.8 million as of December 31, 2015, which represents certain ownership interests in two of our majority-owned consolidated subsidiaries held by noncontrolling owners that are considered redeemable outside of our control, and noncontrolling interests of $11.6 million as of December 31, 2015, which represents the noncontrolling interests in several other majority-owned consolidated subsidiaries.

1796,Offerings 2016.md,3295,UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION,3295.6,NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of Presentation,3295.6.1,,"The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements have been developed by applying pro forma adjustments to our historical audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statements of income (loss) give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as if they had occurred on July 1, 2014 and the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma balance sheet gives pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as if they had occurred on December 31, 2015. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 has been derived by adding the financial data from our condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 to the financial data from our unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) for the six months ended December 31, 2015 and subtracting the financial data from our unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) for the six months ended December 31, 2014. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 has been included in this offering circular in order to provide investors with historical and pro forma information for the latest practicable twelve-month period. The adjustments are limited to amounts that are directly attributable to the Transactions, factually supportable, and with respect to the condensed consolidated pro forma statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact. At the Effective Time, each share of Solera common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such shares (x) that are owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or owned by Solera or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Solera, in each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (y) that are held by stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights with respect to such shares) will be converted into the right to receive an amount equal to $55.85 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. All outstanding vested and unvested stock options, all unvested restricted stock units, and vested, unvested and earned performance share units will be settled for an aggregate amount of approximately $36.0 million in accordance with the Merger Agreement. For purposes of the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements, we have assumed that all of the outstanding shares will receive an amount equal to $55.85 in cash (the “Acquisition Consideration”) and have not made any adjustments with any possible appraisal right. The total purchase consideration paid in connection with the Merger is estimated to be $3.85 billion. The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 805, Business Combinations, under GAAP. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations are based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Management, with the assistance of an independent third party, has made a preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on various preliminary estimates. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon the closing of the Merger will depend on a number of factors, including additional information available and our net assets on the closing date of the Merger. In addition, this pro forma presentation does not contemplate changes in tax structure, accounting policies or synergy benefits. We have also assumed for purposes of this presentation that all outstanding shares will receive the Acquisition Consideration and have not made any adjustments in connection with liabilities (including any interest expense related thereto) that may result from any appraisal rights proceedings. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. 72 ----- The final purchase price allocation is dependent on, among other things, the finalization of asset and liability valuations. As of the date of this offering circular, we have not completed the valuation studies necessary to finalize the estimates of the fair values of the assets we have acquired and liabilities we have assumed and the related allocation of purchase price. We have allocated the total estimated purchase price, calculated as described in this note 1 to the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on preliminary estimates of their fair values. A final determination of these fair values will reflect our consideration of a final valuation prepared by third-party appraisers. This final valuation will be based on the actual net tangible and identifiable intangible assets that existed as of the closing date of the Merger. Any final adjustment will change the allocations of purchase price, which could affect the fair value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements, including a change to goodwill and a change to the amortization of tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Any such changes could differ materially from the valuations and purchase price allocations presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements.

As of December 31, 2015, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our unused availability under our New Revolving Facility would have been approximately $300.0 million. We do not expect to borrow under the New Revolving Facility in connection with the Transactions. (ii) In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into the New Term Loan Facility, which we expect will provide for a seven-year senior secured term loan of $2,200.0 million, including a U.S. dollar tranche and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of a euro tranche. The amount shown excludes any original issue discount. Any original issue discount will be amortized and included as interest expense in our statement of income and comprehensive income over the life of the term loans. (iii) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the notes offered hereby. (iv) Represents the approximate cash preferred equity contribution to be made to Parent by BSPI and KSISH (all of the preferred equity financing provided to Parent will be contributed to the Issuer as common equity). (v) Represents the approximate cash common equity contribution to be made by VEPFV and certain other investors arranged and/or designated by Vista. The cash common equity contribution is expected to be reduced by approximately $278.0 million, the Appraisal Demand Amount, which is not expected to be funded by Common Equity Investors at the closing of the Merger. The cash common equity contribution will be reduced by the aggregate amount the Common Equity Investors elect not to fund. Approximately $121.3 million related to demands for appraisal will be funded at the closing of the Merger. (vi) Reflects our estimate of the total consideration to be paid to holders of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Solera common stock that are entitled to receive the Acquisition Consideration and the settlement of vested and unvested stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units in the Merger, net of $358.2 million of cash from the balance sheet. This amount assumes that all of the outstanding shares will receive the Acquisition Consideration, and we have not made any adjustments for any potential liabilities resulting from any appraisal rights proceedings. Amounts not paid at the closing of the Transactions as a result of appraisal rights may be used by us for other general purposes. See note 1 above. 74 ----- As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of $470.5 million in cash and cash equivalents without giving effect to the Transactions. We expect that at the time of the closing of the Transactions (prior to giving effect to the Transactions), our cash and cash equivalents will be approximately $480.0 million and that approximately $391.0 million of the cash and cash equivalents balance at closing will be used to fund the Transactions, with $210.3 million (includes $121.3 million relating to demands for appraisal that will be funded at closing) of the remainder available as cash for working capital to fund operations. To the extent that our cash and cash equivalents balance at the time of the closing of the Transactions is greater than $480.0 million, such additional cash and cash equivalents will be used to fund the Transactions, and the cash equity contribution described in footnote (v) above will be reduced by the difference between the cash balance at closing used to fund the Transactions and $480.0 million. To the extent that our cash and cash equivalents balance at the time of the closing of the Transactions is less than $480.0 million, the cash equity contribution described in footnote (v) above will be increased by the difference between the cash balance at closing used to fund the Transactions and $480.0 million. The statements in this footnote regarding our expected cash and cash equivalents balance at the closing of the Transactions do not include any impact due to our outstanding foreign currency exchange derivative financial instruments, including any impact attributable to any termination thereof, which amounts could be material. (vii) As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2021 Senior Notes and $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2023 Senior Notes. This amount assumes all of the Existing Notes are tendered in connection with the Tender Offers and excludes any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any unamortized net premium. As of February 29, 2016, 99.96% of the 2021 Senior Notes and 99.96% of the 2023 Senior Notes have been tendered. The 2021 Senior Notes bear interest at 6.000% per annum and are scheduled to mature on June 15, 2021, and the 2023 Senior Notes bear interest at 6.125% per annum and are scheduled to mature on November 1, 2023. (viii) Reflects our estimate of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including early tender participation premiums and accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes, original issue discount, placement fees, initial purchaser discounts, underwriting and other financing fees, advisory fees and other transaction costs and professional fees. The amount included on account of accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes is through December 31, 2015. We estimate the additional accrued interest on the Existing Notes through the expected closing date will be approximately $32.8 million. To the extent any financing fees, accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes, original issue discount and other fees and expenses exceed the estimated amounts, we expect to fund such amounts with cash on our balance sheet at the closing of the Transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

(N) Reflects the estimated income tax expense and deferred taxes related to the adjustments reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements. Tax expense for the pro forma debt adjustments was calculated under the assumption that all new debt will be issued in the United States and subjected to U.S. federal and state income taxes. As such, a federal plus blended state tax rate was utilized. We computed a deferred tax liability of $491 million based on the preliminary step up value that was allocated to identifiable intangibles. This deferred tax liability was computed utilizing a blended tax rate because we operate in multiple jurisdictions. We continue to evaluate and quantify our valuation allowance position and our permanent reinvestment assertion on both historical earnings and the additional outside basis difference created as a result of the fair value adjustments. 78 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

1796,Offerings 2016.md,3295,UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION,3295.14,,3295.14.1,,"The following unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements have been developed by applying pro forma adjustments to our historical audited consolidated financial statements and our historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, each included elsewhere in this offering circular. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statements of income (loss) give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as if they had occurred on July 1, 2014 and the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma balance sheet gives pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as if they had occurred on December 31, 2015. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 has been derived by adding the financial data from our condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 to the financial data from our unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) for the six months ended December 31, 2015 and subtracting the financial data from our unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) for the six months ended December 31, 2014. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 has been included in this offering circular in order to provide investors with historical and pro forma information for the latest practicable twelve-month period. The adjustments are limited to amounts that are directly attributable to the Transactions, factually supportable, and with respect to the condensed consolidated pro forma statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact. The unaudited pro forma adjustments reflected herein are preliminary and based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial data is presented for informational purposes only. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial data does not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial condition would have been had the Transactions actually occurred on the dates indicated, nor do they purport to project our results of operations or financial condition for any future period or as of any future date. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial data should be read in conjunction with the information included under “The Transactions,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Selected Consolidated Historical Financial Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our audited and unaudited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this offering circular. All pro forma adjustments and their underlying assumptions are described more fully in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements. The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic No. 805, Business _Combinations, under GAAP. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated purchase_ price of an acquisition is allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations are based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Management, with the assistance of an independent third party, has made a preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on various preliminary estimates. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon the closing of the Merger will depend on a number of factors, including additional information available and our net assets on the closing date of the Merger. In addition, this pro forma presentation does not contemplate changes in tax structure, accounting policies or synergy benefits. We have also assumed for purposes of this presentation that all outstanding shares will receive the Acquisition Consideration and have not made any adjustments in connection with liabilities (including any interest expense related thereto) that may result from any appraisal rights proceedings. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. For example, as of February 26, 2016, Solera has 65 ----- received purported demands for appraisal with respect to approximately 7,149,364 shares of Solera common stock. Based on this number of shares, the amount of financing necessary to consummate the Merger at the closing is expected to be reduced by approximately $278.0 million. Approximately $121.3 million related to demands for appraisal will be funded at the closing of the Merger. Parent expects to permit the Common Equity Investors, at their option, and on a pro rata basis, to reduce the amount of the common equity contribution to be funded by each of them in cash in connection with the closing in an aggregate amount up to the Appraisal Demand Amount, and the common equity contribution and total stockholders’ equity will be reduced by the aggregate amount that is not funded. The final purchase price allocation is dependent on, among other things, the finalization of asset and liability valuations. As of the date of this offering circular, we have not completed the valuation studies necessary to finalize the estimates of the fair values of the assets we have acquired and liabilities we have assumed and the related allocation of purchase price. We have allocated the total estimated purchase price, calculated as described in note 1 to the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on preliminary estimates of their fair values. A final determination of these fair values will reflect our consideration of a final valuation prepared by third-party appraisers. This final valuation will be based on the actual net tangible and identifiable intangible assets that existed as of the closing date of the Merger. Any final adjustment will change the allocations of purchase price, which could affect the fair value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements, including a change to goodwill and a change to the amortization of tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Any such changes could differ materially from the valuations and purchase price allocations presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements. 66 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

Foreign currency._** During fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 and the six months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we generated approximately 56%, 63%, 68%, 50% and 57% of our revenues, respectively, and incurred a majority of our costs, in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. We translate our local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period for our consolidated statement of income and certain components of stockholders’ equity and the exchange rate at the end of that period for the consolidated balance sheet. These translations resulted in foreign currency translation adjustments of $(167.7) million, $39.1 million, $8.4 million, $24.1 million and $99.1 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014 89 ----- and 2013 and the six months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) recognized in our consolidated statements of income (loss) were $(50.5) million, $11.0 million, $(5.5) million, $(9.3) million and $(8.7) million during fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013 and the six months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Exchange rates between most of the major foreign currencies we use to transact our business and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate during fiscal year 2016. The majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in Euros, Pound Sterling, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars and other foreign currencies.

The average U.S. dollar strengthened versus the Euro by 11.4% and the Pound Sterling by 3.2%, which decreased our revenues and expenses during fiscal year 2015. A hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in the U.S. dollar versus other currencies in which we transact our business would have resulted in an increase or decrease, as the case may be, to our revenues of $31.7 million during fiscal year 2015. During the six months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2014, the U.S. dollar strengthened against most major foreign currencies we use to transact our business. The average U.S. dollar strengthened versus the Euro by 14.3% and the Pound Sterling by 5.7%, which decreased our revenues and expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2015. A hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in the U.S. dollar versus other currencies in which we transact our business would have resulted in an increase or decrease, as the case may be, to our revenues of $15.5 million during the six months ended December 31, 2015. Factors that affect business volume._** The following external factors have or may have an effect on the number of claims that are submitted and/or our volume of transactions, any of which can affect our revenues: ‰ Number of insurance claims made. In fiscal year 2015, the number of insurance claims made increased slightly versus fiscal year 2014. In several of our large western European markets, the number of insurance claims for vehicle damage submitted by owners to their insurance carriers declined slightly. The number of insurance claims made can be influenced by factors such as unemployment levels, the number of miles driven, rising gasoline prices, the number of uninsured drivers, rising insurance premiums and insured opting for lower coverage or higher deductible levels, among other things. Fewer claims made can reduce the transaction-based fees that we generate. ‰ Sales of new and used vehicles. According to industry sources, global new light vehicle sales grew by 3.6% in 2014 to 86.3 million units and sales are forecasted to reach 88.4 million 90 ----- units, up by 2.4%, in 2015. In Advanced Markets, sales are projected to grow at a 0.7% CAGR from 2014 through 2024. In other markets, sales are projected to grow at a 6.6% CAGR from 2014 through 2024. Fewer new light vehicle sales can result in fewer insured vehicles on the road and fewer automobile accidents, which can reduce the transaction-based fees that we generate. ‰ Damaged vehicle repair costs. The cost to repair damaged vehicles, also known as severity, includes labor, parts and other related costs. Severity has steadily risen for a number of years. According to industry sources, from 2001 through 2010, the price index for body work has increased by 30.5% compared with a 23.2% increase in the general cost of living index. Insurance companies purchase our products and services to help standardize the cost of repair. Should the cost of labor, parts and other related items continue to increase over time, insurance companies may seek to purchase and utilize an increasing number of our products and services to help improve the standardization of the cost of repair. ‰ Penetration Rate of Vehicle Insurance. An increasing rate of procuring vehicle insurance will result in an increase in the number of insurance claims made for damaged vehicles. An increasing number of insurance claims submitted can increase the transaction-based fees that we generate for partial-loss and total-loss estimates. This is due in part to both increased regulation and increased use of financing in the purchase of new and used vehicles. We expect that the rate of vehicle insurance in our less mature international markets will continue to increase during the next eighteen months. ‰ Automobile Usage-Number of Miles Driven. Several factors can influence miles driven, including gasoline prices and economic conditions. According to industry sources, for calendar year 2014, cumulative miles driven in the United States increased by 2.6% compared to the same period in the prior year. For calendar year 2013, cumulative miles driven in the United States remained flat compared to the same period in the prior year. Fewer miles driven can result in fewer automobile accidents, which can reduce the transaction-based fees that we generate. ‰ Seasonality. Our business is subject to seasonal and other fluctuations. In particular, we have historically experienced higher revenues during the second quarter and third quarter versus the first quarter and fourth quarter during each fiscal year. This seasonality is caused primarily by more days of inclement weather during the second quarter and third quarter in most of our markets, which contributes to a greater number of vehicle accidents and damage during these periods. In addition, our business is subject to fluctuations caused by other factors, including the occurrence of extraordinary weather events and the timing of certain public holidays. For example, the Easter holiday occurs during the third quarter in certain fiscal years and occurs during the fourth quarter in other fiscal years, resulting in a change in the number of business days during the quarter in which the holiday occurs. Share-based_** **_compensation_** **_expense._** We incurred pre-tax, non-cash share-based compensation charges of $36.9 million, $37.5 million, $25.8 million, $14.2 million and $14.3 million during fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 and for the six months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect to recognize additional pre-tax, non-cash share-based compensation charges related to share-based awards outstanding at December 31, 2015. The estimated total remaining unamortized share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, was $29.2 million at December 31, 2015, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years. Restructuring charges._** We have incurred restructuring charges in each period presented and also expect to incur additional restructuring charges, primarily relating to severance costs, over the next several quarters as we work to improve efficiencies in our business. We do not expect reduced revenues or an increase in other expenses as a result of continued implementation of our restructuring initiatives. 91 ----- Other factors._** Other factors that have or may have an effect on our operating results include: ‰ gain and loss of customers; ‰ pricing pressures; ‰ acquisitions, joint ventures or similar transactions; ‰ expenses to develop new software or services; and ‰ expenses and restrictions related to indebtedness. We do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations in recent years.

The following is a summary of outstanding derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2015 that are relevant to our exposure to foreign currency risk: ‰ In April 2012, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swaps in the aggregate notional amount of €109.0 million. We pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 6.990% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.750% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the swaps is June 15, 2018. These cross-currency swaps were designated, at inception, as cash flow hedges and we evaluate the swaps for effectiveness quarterly. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. To date, there has been no hedge ineffectiveness. ‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay floating / received fixed interest rate swap with a notional amount of $400.0 million. Under the terms of the interest rate swap, we pay quarterly floating coupon payments at 3-month LIBOR plus 3.924% and receive semi-annual fixed coupon payments at 6.000%. The maturity date of the interest rate swap is June 15, 2021, although the swap may be terminated at any time effective June 15, 2017 by the counterparty subject to the payment of a cancellation fee.

Under the terms of the forward contract, we pay predetermined forward rate on the settlement date. The foreign exchange forward contract was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). In July 2015, we partially settled the foreign exchange forward contract for a cash payment of $8.9 million which is reported in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

The decrease in the income tax provision is primarily due to the U.S. tax benefit related to the increase in certain expenses during fiscal year 2015. 96 ----- For the six months ended December 31, 2015, the expected tax provision derived from applying the U.S. federal statutory rate to our pre-tax income differed from our recorded income tax provision primarily due to the amount of our pre-tax loss, relative to our income tax expense, nondeductible expenses, and changes in tax law. Our income tax provision for the six months ended December 31, 2015 is not necessarily indicative of the effective tax rate that may be expected for fiscal year 2016. Our tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Our interim tax provision is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in law, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. Factors that impact our income tax provision include, but are not limited to, the mix of jurisdictional earnings and varying jurisdictional income tax rates, establishment and release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, permanent differences resulting from the book and tax treatment of certain items, and discrete items. Future changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. As of each reporting date, management considers all evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact our view with regards to future realization of deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets $26.9 million due to the limitation in our ability to utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. We are subject to periodic changes in the amount of our income tax provision and these changes could adversely affect our operating results; we may not be able to utilize all of our tax benefits before they expire. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by our mix of earnings in countries with high versus low tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by a change in our assertion that our foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested; by the outcomes of examinations, audits or disputes by or with relevant tax authorities; or by changes in tax laws and regulations. There have been several U.S. domestic and international laws which recently expired or were enacted that could continue to have a material adverse impact on our tax expense. Our ability to utilize certain U.S. tax deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income before the expiration of the carryforward period. The decrease in our U.S. taxable income, including recent increases in interest expense resulted in a decrease in the amount of U.S. deferred tax assets considered realizable. Our projections of future taxable income required to fully realize the recorded amount of the net deferred tax asset reflect numerous assumptions about our operating business and investments, and are subject to change as conditions change specific to our operating business, investments or general economic conditions. Adverse changes in certain jurisdictions could result in the need to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in a charge against earnings. Significant judgment is required to apply the recognition and measurement criteria prescribed in ASC Topic No. 740-10, Income Taxes. In addition, ASC Topic No. 740-10 applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which, if settled unfavorably, could 97 ----- adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. We record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic No. 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. Primarily due to the increase in our U.S. debt service obligations resulting from the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million during fiscal year 2015 and the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $850.0 million in July 2015, management concluded that the ability to access certain amounts of foreign earnings would provide greater flexibility to meet domestic cash flow needs without constraining foreign objectives. Accordingly, in fiscal year 2015 we withdrew the permanent reinvestment assertion on $350.0 million of earnings generated by certain of our foreign subsidiaries through fiscal year 2015. We provided for U.S. income taxes on the $350.0 million of undistributed foreign earnings, resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax liability of approximately $123.7 million. During the six months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a deferred income tax expense of $2.9 million related to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchanges rates on the portion of the $350.0 million of unremitted earnings generated prior to fiscal year 2015. We have not provided for U.S. federal or foreign income taxes, including withholding taxes, on the remaining $840.7 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015. We continue to assert that the $840.7 million of undistributed earnings is permanently reinvested in our foreign operations and have no current plans to repatriate those earnings. If we were to distribute those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we could be subject to both U.S. income and foreign taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. It is currently not practicable to compute the residual taxes due on such earnings as we do not know the time or manner in which we would distribute these earnings. 98 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred tax expense of approximately $149.5 million related to undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries generated in fiscal year 2015 and prior years, partially offset by earnings in jurisdictions with lower income tax rates which are indefinitely reinvested. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2014 was primarily attributable to the recognition of a $24.8 million valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets, partially offset by earnings in jurisdictions with lower income tax rates which are indefinitely reinvested. Factors that impact our income tax provision include, but are not limited to, the mix of jurisdictional earnings and varying jurisdictional income tax rates, establishment and release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, permanent differences resulting from the book and tax treatment of certain items, and discrete items. Future changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. We are subject to periodic changes in the amount of our income tax provision and these changes could adversely affect our operating results; we may not be able to utilize all of our tax benefits before they expire. Primarily due to the increase in our U.S. debt service obligations resulting from the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million in November 2014 and the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $850.0 million in July 2015, management concluded that the ability to access certain amounts of foreign earnings would provide greater flexibility to meet domestic cash flow needs without constraining foreign objectives. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we withdrew the permanent reinvestment assertion on $350.0 million of earnings generated by certain of our foreign subsidiaries through fiscal year 2015. We provided for U.S. income taxes on the $350.0 million of undistributed foreign earnings, resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax liability of approximately $123.7 million. We recognized additional deferred income tax expense of $25.8 million related to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year 2015 on the portion of the $350.0 million of unremitted earnings generated prior to fiscal year 2015. We have not provided for U.S. federal or foreign income taxes, including withholding taxes, on the remaining $840.7 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015. We continue to assert that the $840.7 million of undistributed earnings is permanently reinvested in our foreign operations and have no current plans to repatriate those earnings. If we were to distribute those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we could be subject to both U.S. income and foreign taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. It is currently not practicable to compute the residual taxes due on such earnings as we do not know the time or manner in which we would distribute these earnings. Significant judgment is required to apply the recognition and measurement criteria prescribed in ASC Topic No. 740-10, Income Taxes. In addition, ASC Topic No. 740-10 applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which, if settled unfavorably, could 106 ----- adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. We record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic No. 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

See “The Transactions—The Tender Offers, Consent Solicitations and the Change of Control Offers.” The Tender Offers are contingent upon, among other things, the simultaneous closing of the Merger. The indentures governing the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes contain limited covenants, including those restricting our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain liens, engage in sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge with, or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of our or their assets to, another person, and, in the case of any of our subsidiaries that did not issue or guarantee such notes, incur indebtedness. We are in compliance with the specified covenants of the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes at December 31, 2015. In November 2014, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program, replacing the share repurchase program authorized in October 2013, for up to a total of $375 million of Solera common stock through December 31, 2016. Share repurchases are made from time to time, through an accelerated stock purchase agreement, in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program does not require us to purchase any specific number or amount of shares, and the timing and amount of such purchases will be determined by management based upon market conditions and other factors. In addition, the program may be amended or terminated at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Through December 31, 2015, we have repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for $78.8 million under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in November 2014. 107 ----- On December 3, 2015, we paid a quarterly cash dividend with a value of $0.225 per outstanding share of common stock and per outstanding restricted stock unit to our stockholders and restricted stock unit holders of record on November 19, 2015. The aggregate dividend payments for the six months ended December 31, 2015 was $30.5 million. We believe that our existing cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital and debt service requirements, as well as investment of capital in acquisition and other strategic and investment opportunities for at least the next twelve months. Our management believes that our cash is best utilized by investing in the future growth of our business to support improving our results of operations, either through acquisitions or penetration of new geographic markets and other strategic opportunities, and maximizing stockholder return through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. We regularly review acquisition and other strategic opportunities, which may require additional debt or equity financing. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, further dilution to our then-existing stockholders may result. Additional debt financing may include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any equity or debt financing may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences, that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. Our foreign subsidiaries generate earnings that are not subject to U.S. income taxes so long as they are permanently reinvested in our operations outside of the United States. Pursuant to ASC Topic No. 740-30 (formerly APB 23), undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested would become subject to deferred income taxes under U.S. tax law. Prior to fiscal year 2015, we asserted that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were permanently reinvested. Primarily due to the increase in our U.S. debt service obligations resulting from the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million in November 2014 and the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $850.0 million in July 2015, management concluded that the ability to access certain amounts of foreign earnings would provide greater flexibility to meet domestic cash flow needs without constraining foreign objectives. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we withdrew the permanent reinvestment assertion on $350.0 million of earnings generated by certain of our foreign subsidiaries through fiscal year 2015. There is no certainty as to the timing of when such foreign earnings will be distributed to the U.S. in whole or in part. Further, when the foreign earnings are distributed to the U.S., we anticipate that a substantial portion of the resulting U.S. income taxes due would be reduced by existing deferred tax assets. We have not provided for U.S. federal or foreign income taxes, including withholding taxes, on the remaining $840.7 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015. We continue to assert that the $840.7 million of undistributed earnings is permanently reinvested in our foreign operations and have no current plans to repatriate those earnings. If we were to distribute those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we could be subject to both U.S. income and foreign taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. It is currently not practicable to compute the residual taxes due on such earnings as we do not know the time or manner in which we would distribute these earnings. 108 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies, which may be affected by our estimates and assumptions, are more fully described in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements and in Note 1 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, each included elsewhere in this offering circular. We believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets._** Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Impairment indicators arise when events or changes in 112 ----- circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant downturn in industry or economic trends with a direct impact on the business, an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of for less than the carrying value, loss of key personnel, or a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group. We test goodwill for impairment annually at a reporting unit level using a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the potential impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We determine the fair value of our reporting units through a combination of an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow model, and a market approach, which considers comparable companies and transactions. Under the income approach, the discounted cash flow model determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of projected reporting unit cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period. Both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows. A weighted average cost of capital of a market participant is used as the discount rate. The residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the estimated reporting unit net cash flows at the end of the projection period. Alternatively, the present value of the residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period. In addition to the projected reporting unit cash flows, the key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model include a discount rate and a long-term growth rate. The discount rate used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting units as of June 30, 2015 using the income approach ranged between 9.5% and 15.7%, with an average discount rate of 11.9%. The long-term growth rate used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting units as of June 30, 2015 using the income approach ranged between 3.0% and 6.0%, with an average long-term growth rate of 4.1%. Under the market approach, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined based on multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for each reporting unit. The multiples were determined based on a selection of comparable companies and acquisition transactions, discounted for each reporting unit to reflect the relative size, diversification and risk of the reporting unit in comparison to the indexed companies and transactions. In our annual goodwill impairment assessment for fiscal year 2015, we concluded that the fair values of the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned exceeded their respective carrying values by at least 51% and by over 124% on average. Accordingly, we did not identify any goodwill impairment. Our estimates of the fair value of our reporting units can be affected by many assumptions that require significant judgment. For example, the projected reporting unit cash flows used in the discounted cash flow model under the income approach reflect assumptions related to existing customer penetration, new customer acquisition, product innovation and development, total addressable market, pricing, market share, competition and technology obsolescence. Our estimates of fair value may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions. New information may arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments to our estimates in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 113 ----- We test indefinite-lived intangible assets at the unit of accounting level by making a determination of the fair value of the intangible asset. If the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference. We also evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets that are not subject to amortization on an annual basis to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If an intangible asset that is not being amortized is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, that asset is tested for impairment. After recognition of the impairment, if any, the asset is amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. We determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets under an income approach using the relief from royalty method, which assumes value to the extent that the acquired company is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the assets. In our annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment for fiscal year 2015, we concluded that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying value and, accordingly, we did not identify any impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Long-Lived Assets._** We review long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives and property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used, the loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, significant negative industry or economic trends or the presence of other factors that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable. We consider a long-lived asset to be impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset. If we deem an asset to be impaired, the amount of the impairment loss represents the excess of the asset’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value. Revenue Recognition._** Revenues are recognized only after services are provided, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, and when collectability is probable. Our multiple element arrangements primarily include a combination of software licenses, hosted database and other services, installation and set-up services, hardware, maintenance services and transaction-based deliverables. We generate a significant majority of our revenue from subscription-based contracts (where a monthly fee is charged), transaction-based contracts (where a fee per transaction is charged) and subscription-based contracts with additional transaction-based fees (where a monthly fee and a fee per transaction are charged). Subscription-based and transaction-based contracts generally include the delivery of software, access to our database through a hosted service, upfront fees for the implementation and set-up activities necessary for the client to use/access the software and maintenance. Under a subscription arrangement, we consider delivery of software, access to the hosted database and maintenance to be a combined unit of accounting and recognize related revenues at the end of each month upon the completion of the monthly service. A transaction-based fee represents a payment for the right to use the software, access to the hosted database and maintenance. We consider the fee to be fixed and determinable only at the time actual usage occurs, and, accordingly, we recognize revenue at the time of actual usage. Implementation services and set-up activities are necessary for the client to receive services/ software. We defer up-front fees billed during the implementation/set-up phase and recognize such 114 ----- revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated customer life. Recognition of this deferred revenue will commence upon the start of the monthly service. Implementation and set-up costs that are direct and incremental to the contract are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated customer life. Revenues are reflected net of customer sales allowances, which are based on both specific identification of certain accounts and a predetermined percentage of revenue based on historical experience. Share-Based Compensation._** We expense share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units. We estimate the value of stock options with vesting contingent upon the achievement of service conditions as of the date the award was granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes optionpricing model requires the use of certain input variables, as follows: ‰ Expected Volatility. Volatility is a measure of the amount the stock price will fluctuate during the expected life of an award. We determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock price. ‰ Risk-Free Interest Rate. We based the risk-free interest rates on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of the grant with remaining terms equivalent to the respective expected terms of the stock options. ‰ Expected Dividend Yield. Our assumption of the dividend yield is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts and may be subject to substantial change in the future. ‰ Expected Award Life. We determine the expected life of an award by considering various relevant factors, including the vesting period and contractual term of the award, our employees’ historical exercise patterns and length of service, the expected future volatility of our stock price and employee characteristics. In addition to the variables above, we are also required to estimate at the grant date the likelihood that the award will ultimately vest (the “pre-vesting forfeiture rate”), and revise the estimate, if necessary, in future periods if the actual forfeiture rate differs. We determine the pre-vesting forfeiture rate of an award based on industry and employee turnover data as well as historical pre-vesting forfeitures occurring over the previous year. We recognize additional share-based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated and a recovery of previously recognized share-based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than estimated. The fair value of restricted stock units with vesting contingent upon the achievement of service conditions and performance share units with vesting contingent upon the achievement of performance conditions equals the intrinsic value on the date the award was granted. To estimate the grant date fair value of performance share units and stock options with vesting contingent upon the achievement of market conditions, we utilize a Monte-Carlo simulation model which simulates a range of possible future stock prices for us and the identified peer companies. Income Taxes._** Income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws. The effects of future enactments of changes in tax laws or rates are not contemplated. 115 ----- In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax liabilities are more likely than not to be assessed. If we ultimately determine that the obligation is unwarranted, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. This may occur for a variety of reasons, such as the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a particular tax return or the signing of a final settlement agreement with the respective tax authority. We record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be. As part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods. This process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences, or reversing book-tax differences, resulting from differing treatment of items, such as amortization of intangibles, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable using the morelikely-than-not standard. In our assessment, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If we determine that our deferred tax assets do not meet the more-likely-than-not standard, we establish a valuation allowance. We exercise significant judgment relating to the projection of future taxable income. If judgments regarding recoverability of deferred tax assets change in future periods, we may need to adjust our valuation allowances, which could impact our results of operations in the period in which such determination is made. As of December 31, 2015, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets of $26.9 million due to the limitation in our ability to utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. In assessing the future realization of our U.S. deferred tax assets, all available evidence was considered, including our U.S. cumulative income or loss position over the 12 quarters ended June 30, 2015 which included recent increases to interest expense. The U.S. cumulative loss position reduced the weight given to subjective evidence such as projections for future growth. As of each reporting date, our management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact management’s view with regards to future realization of deferred tax assets. The Company relies heavily on Subpart F income as a future source of taxable income to support the conclusion that the domestic deferred tax assets were more-likely-than-not realizable. We believe that our estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently uncertain, and if our current or future operations and investments generate taxable income different than the anticipated amounts or U.S. tax law changes reduce future Subpart F income, adjustments to the valuation allowance are possible. Our foreign subsidiaries generate earnings that are not subject to U.S. income taxes so long as they are permanently reinvested in our operations outside of the U.S. Pursuant to ASC Topic No. 740-30 (formerly APB 23), undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested would become subject to deferred income taxes under U.S. tax law. In determining if the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested, we consider the following: (i) the forecasts, budgets and cash requirements of our U.S business and our foreign subsidiaries, both for the short and long term; (ii) the tax consequences of any decision to reinvest foreign earnings, including any changes in U.S. income tax law relating to the treatment of 116 ----- these undistributed foreign earnings; and (iii) any U.S. and foreign government programs or regulations relating to the repatriation of these unremitted earnings. If we were to conclude that our foreign earnings are no longer permanently reinvested, we would be required to provide deferred income taxes on these earnings, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations. Further, if we initiate actions to repatriate these unremitted earnings and precipitate payments of U.S. income taxes, such payments could materially adversely affect our liquidity. Prior to fiscal year 2015, we asserted that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were permanently reinvested. Primarily due to the increase in our U.S. debt service obligations resulting from the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million during fiscal year 2015 and the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $850.0 million in July 2015, management concluded that the ability to access certain amounts of foreign earnings would provide greater flexibility to meet domestic cash flow needs without constraining foreign objectives. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we withdrew the permanent reinvestment assertion on $350.0 million of earnings generated by certain of our foreign subsidiaries through fiscal year 2015. We provided for U.S. income taxes on the $350.0 million of undistributed foreign earnings, resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax liability of approximately $123.7 million. We recognized additional deferred income tax expense of $25.8 million related to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year 2015 on the portion of the $350.0 million of unremitted earnings generated prior to fiscal year 2015. There is no certainty as to the timing of when such foreign earnings will be distributed to the U.S. in whole or in part. Further, when the foreign earnings are distributed to the U.S., we anticipate that a substantial portion of the resulting U.S. income taxes due would be reduced by existing deferred tax assets. We have not provided for U.S. federal or foreign income taxes, including withholding taxes, on the remaining $840.7 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015. We continue to assert that the $840.7 million of undistributed earnings is permanently reinvested in our foreign operations and have no current plans to repatriate those earnings. If we were to distribute those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we could be subject to both U.S. income and foreign taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. It is currently not practicable to compute the residual taxes due on such earnings as we do not know the time or manner in which we would distribute these earnings. Derivative Financial Instruments._** We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency exposures. Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge, the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions occur and affect earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow and net investment hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market at the end of each period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The following is a summary of outstanding derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2015: ‰ In April 2012, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swaps in the aggregate notional amount of €109.0 million. We pay Euro fixed coupon 117 ----- payments at 6.990% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.750% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the swaps is June 15, 2018. These cross-currency swaps were designated, at inception, as cash flow hedges and we evaluate the swaps for effectiveness quarterly. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. To date, there has been no hedge ineffectiveness. ‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay floating / received fixed interest rate swap with a notional amount of $400.0 million. Under the terms of the interest rate swap, we pay quarterly floating coupon payments at 3-month LIBOR plus 3.924% and receive semi-annual fixed coupon payments at 6.000%. The maturity date of the interest rate swap is June 15, 2021, although the swap may be terminated at any time effective June 15, 2017 by the counterparty subject to the payment of a cancellation fee. The interest rate swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). ‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars crosscurrency swap with a notional amount of €401.6 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.993% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is June 15, 2021. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). ‰ In March 2015, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swap with a notional amount of €174.8 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.725% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is June 15, 2021. The cross-currency swap was designated as a net investment hedge at inception. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. On October 1, 2015, we dedesignated this cross-currency swap as a net investment hedge. Upon de-designation, we recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). ‰ In March 2015, we entered into a foreign exchange forward contract with a notional amount of €472.9 million. Under the terms of the forward contract, we pay predetermined forward rate on the settlement date. The foreign exchange forward contract was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). In July 2015, we partially settled the foreign exchange forward contract for a cash payment of $8.9 million which is reported in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Settlement of the remaining foreign exchange forward contract with a notional amount of €235.8 million was extended to July 2016. ‰ In July 2015, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swaps, each with a notional amount of €137.0 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swaps, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.135% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swaps is November 1, 2018. One of the cross-currency swaps was designated as a net investment hedge at inception and one was not designated as a hedge at inception. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on the cross-currency swap designated as a net investment hedge 118 ----- as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. On October 1, 2015, we de-designated this cross currency swap as a net investment hedge. Upon de-designation, we recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swaps in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). ‰ In July 2015, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swap with a notional amount of €274.0 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.585% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is November 1, 2023. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). We determined the estimated fair value of our derivatives using an income approach and standard valuation techniques that utilize market-based observable inputs including spot and forward interest and foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities and interest rate curves at observable intervals. Our estimate of fair value also considers the risk that the swap contracts will not be fulfilled. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests._** Certain of the ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries held by noncontrolling owners are considered redeemable outside of our control. Accordingly, we have presented these redeemable noncontrolling interests as a mezzanine item in our consolidated balance sheet. If redeemable at fair value, the redeemable noncontrolling interests are reported at their fair value with any adjustment of the carrying value to fair value recorded to common shares in stockholders’ equity. We estimate the fair value of our noncontrolling interests through an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow model, and a market approach, which considers comparable companies and transactions. Under the income approach, the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period. Both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows. A weighted average cost of capital of a market participant is used as the discount rate. The residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period. Alternatively, the present value of the residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period. Under the market approach, fair value is determined based on multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for each reporting unit. The multiples were determined based on a selection of comparable companies and acquisition transactions, discounted for each reporting unit to reflect the relative size, diversification and risk of the reporting unit in comparison to the indexed companies and transactions. Although we considered the fair value under both the income and market approaches, we ultimately determined the fair value of our redeemable noncontrolling interests based solely upon the income approach, which utilizes a discounted cash flow as we believe this is the best indicator of fair value. The key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model include a discount rate and a long-term growth rate. The discount rate used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2015 using the income approach ranged between 12.8% and 16.4%, with a weighted average discount rate of 13.2%, reflecting a market participant’s 119 ----- perspective as a noncontrolling shareholder in a privately-held subsidiary. The long-term growth rate used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2015 using the income approach was 4.0%.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

This guidance primarily requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the effective date, which deferred the effective date of ASU Topic No. 2014-09 for one year. As a result, ASU Topic No. 2014-09 will be effective for our fiscal year 2019. ASU Topic No. 2014-09 permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the effect that ASU Topic No. 2014-09 will have on our financial condition, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an _Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to perform interim and_ annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity’s financial statements. ASU Topic No. 2014-15 is effective for our fiscal year 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015-3, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic _835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs_ related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU Topic No. 2015-3 is effective for our fiscal year 2017. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU Topic No. 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs _Associated With Line-of-Credit Arrangements—Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting, which clarified the presentation and measurement_ requirements of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit arrangements. ASU Topic No. 2015-15 allows an entity to either defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement, or present them as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt as provided by ASU Topic No. 2015-3. ASU Topic No. 2015-15 is effective for our fiscal year 2017. The adoption of these standards will result in reclassification of debt issuance costs from assets to liabilities. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015-5, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal_Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing _Arrangement, which provides guidance to help entities determine whether a cloud computing_ arrangement includes a software license and evaluate fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement.

We estimate there are approximately 60,500 collision repair facilities in our markets. The operating costs of these facilities have increased substantially over the past decade due to continued increases in sophisticated technologies and advanced materials used in vehicle manufacture, inflation in collision repair labor rates and changes in environmental regulations. In addition, collision repair facilities have increasingly established preferred relationships with insurance companies. These arrangements, known in the United States as direct repair programs, allow collision repair facilities to generate increased repair volumes through insurance company referrals. Insurance companies benefit by establishing a trusted network of collision repair facilities across which they can negotiate labor rates and implement standard procedures and best practices. Insurance companies often require collision repair facilities to use specified automated claims processing software and related services to participate in their programs.

The automobile insurance claims process generally begins following an automobile collision and consists of the following steps: First Notice of Loss** ‰ The policyholder initiates the claim process with the insurance company. ‰ The insurance company assigns the claim to an assessor and/or a collision repair facility. Investigation** ‰ The assessor conducts interviews, examines photos and reviews police reports. ‰ The insurance company, assessor or collision repair facility estimates the cost to repair the vehicle. ‰ In the case of a heavily damaged vehicle, the assessor or collision repair facility may request a pre-accident vehicle valuation. Evaluation** ‰ The insurance company reviews the estimate and/or pre-accident valuation and confirms the results of the investigation. ‰ The insurance company may request additional information and/or require follow-up investigation. Decision** ‰ The insurance company determines whether the vehicle should be repaired or declared a total loss. ‰ Based on its evaluation, the insurance company determines who is liable for the claim and the repair or total loss amount it intends to pay. Settlement** ‰ The insurance company notifies the policyholder or the collision repair facility of the amount it intends to pay. 127 ----- ‰ The policyholder or collision repair facility may negotiate the final payment amount with the insurance company. ‰ In some cases, two or more insurance companies may settle claims amongst themselves depending on fault or payment liability. Vehicle Repair** ‰ The collision repair facility repairs the vehicle if it is not a total loss. ‰ The collision repair facility or the insurance company may periodically communicate the repair status to the insured policyholder. ‰ The collision repair facility purchases replacement parts from original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, aftermarket parts makers or automotive recyclers. ‰ Further revisions to the claim payment amount may occur if additional damage or cost savings are identified. Payment** ‰ The insurance company pays the policyholder or the collision repair facility in the case of a repairable vehicle. ‰ The insurance company pays the policyholder the pre-accident value (less the amount of the insurance deductible) of the vehicle in the case of a total loss. ‰ The insurance company is paid the actual cash value of the total loss vehicle by the buyer of the salvage vehicle. Each of these steps consists of multiple actions requiring significant and complex interaction among several parties. For example, the investigation step generally involves insurance companies, assessors, collision repair facilities and automotive recyclers and includes conducting interviews, taking and examining photographs, obtaining and reviewing police reports and estimating repair costs and salvage values. When performed manually, many of these tasks, such as the mailing of vehicle photographs or the estimating of vehicle repair costs, can be time-consuming. In addition, without an efficient means of communication that facilitates real-time access to data, claim-related negotiations can result in increased cycle times and unnecessary costs.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

We believe that the principal drivers of demand for our software and services are: _Claims process fragmentation_ The automobile insurance claims process involves many parties and consists of many steps, which are often managed through paper, fax and other labor intensive processes. Our software and services simplify and streamline the claims process, allowing our customers to process claims faster and reduce their costs. _Asymmetrical information_ Collision repair facilities typically have more information about vehicles in their shops than do insurance companies who often must make their damage estimates remotely or with limited information. Our databases provide insurance companies access to detailed information about vehicle damage, repair times and replacement costs, allowing them to more accurately estimate fair settlement values and reduce overpayment on claims. 128 ----- _Disparate claims data_ Claims-related data generated by automobile insurance companies often is not stored, shared with other parties or captured in a format that is easily transferable to other applications. This, combined with the inability to transfer and manipulate data easily across multiple applications, hinders comparisons of repairs and claims. Our databases are constantly updated for actual claims data from industry participants. Having access to our databases helps insurance companies generate more accurate repair estimates and identify top-performing collision repair facilities. _Conflicting interests of industry participants_ Collision repair facilities benefit from high repair costs, which increase their revenues. Conversely, insurance companies benefit from low repair costs, which reduce their expenses. This conflict can result in high settlement costs and delays. Our software and services provide repair cost estimates that rely on common data sources which in turn reduce these costs and delays. _Inefficient collision repair facility workflow_ Many collision repair facilities manage their complex workflows manually or without specialized software. Manual workflow management leads to increased processing time, higher costs and more errors, problems that generally intensify as vehicles become more technologically complex, the number of vehicle models proliferate and as repair facilities grow. Our claims processing software and services assist collision repair facilities in effectively managing their workflows and obtaining detailed part availability and pricing information. _Importance of communications between insurance and repair companies and their customers_ Insurance policyholders and collision repair customers increasingly rank communications and access to information as critical factors in their satisfaction. These factors directly impact their decisionmaking process as well as their willingness to recommend body shops to their insureds. Our software and services enable our insurance and collision repair customers to provide transparent communications, increasing both customer retention and new customer acquisition.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

The majority of our customers access our software and services through a standard Web browser utilizing a “software on demand” model. By subscribing to our services, our customers can reduce upfront investments in software, hardware, implementation services and information technology staff that they would typically make with traditional software solutions. _Estimating and Workflow Software_ Our core offering is our estimating and workflow software. Our estimating and workflow software helps our customers manage the overall claims process, estimate the cost to repair a damaged vehicle, and calculate the pre-collision fair market value of a vehicle. Key functions of our estimating and workflow software include: capturing first notice of loss information; assigning, managing and monitoring claims and claim-related events; accessing and exchanging claims-related information; calculating, submitting, tracking and storing repair and total loss estimates; reviewing, assessing and reporting estimate variations based upon pre-set rules; routing shop estimates for manual review; and scheduling repairs and automating parts ordering. 129 ----- _Salvage Disposition Software_ Generally, if the estimated cost to repair a vehicle reaches a threshold or percentage of the actual cash value of the vehicle, it is declared a total loss. Our salvage disposition software and networks help insurers maximize the proceeds of disposing of the totaled vehicle by connecting buyers and sellers via an electronic auction network. Key functions of our salvage disposition software include: determining the value of a vehicle in real-time as the repair estimate is being written to determine the actual cash value as an aid in determining if a vehicle is a total loss; determining the actual cash value of a vehicle allowing the insurance company to maximize its yield; and connecting sellers with qualified buyers. _Subrogation_ We provide web-based subrogation solutions that lower processing costs, automate processes for efficiency, provide objectivity, and increase accuracy for both subrogation claims and out-of-network claims in the United States. This drives consumer satisfaction by allowing insurance companies, assessors, and collision repair shops to seamlessly process out-of-network claims, regardless of the estimating platform being used. _Claims Database_ Our claims database enables our customers to evaluate their internal claims process performance, as well as measure the performance of their business partners. Our employees also use this database to provide consulting services to our customers and develop new software and services. Customers use this database to benchmark their performance against their local peer group through detailed analyses of comprehensive industry data. Compiled over the past 15 years, this database contains approximately two billion data records representing over 340 million automobile repair claims and over $200 billion in claims payments. We update this database by incorporating more than 650,000 additional repair estimates every week. _Repair Estimating Database_ We have developed our repair estimating database over 48 years through the development, collection, organization and management of automobile-related information. The data in this database enables our customers to estimate the cost to repair a damaged vehicle. This database: ‰ contains detailed cost data for each part and the required labor operations needed to complete repairs on over 5,500 vehicle types; ‰ covers over 99.2% of the vehicle models in our core markets; ‰ includes vehicles data dating back to 1967; ‰ includes over 8.0 million parts for vehicles with multiple model years, editions, option packages and country-specific variations; ‰ includes over 6.5 million aftermarket parts; and ‰ includes over 5.9 million graphics. We update this database with data provided to us by third parties, including original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and aftermarket part suppliers, and automotive recyclers, along with data we develop through our proprietary analyses of local labor repair times and damage repair techniques. The quality and accuracy of the database, which are very important to each of our customers, are continuously monitored and maintained using rigorous quality control processes, which include updating over 2.4 million data records every month. 130 ----- _Salvage Vehicle Database_ Our salvage vehicle database helps our customers buy, sell and estimate the value of salvage vehicles. Through our eSalvage exchange each year, our customers list approximately 1.2 million salvage vehicles for sale and more than 10,600 qualified bidders enter approximately 8.0 million bids for the purchase of salvage vehicles. _Automotive Glass Repair_ Claims involving the breakage of vehicle glass, are characterized as high-frequency, low-severity and have long been considered a burden in claim operations for many major insurance carriers. Since auto glass-only claims represent a small fraction of total auto severity, carriers often outsource these claims in order to focus on the higher dollar cases, such as total loss and auto/medical claims. There are about 14 million glass repair or replacements performed annually in the United States. Approximately one-half of these are insured claims. Operating under the brand names of LYNX Services, GTS Services and GLAXIS, we provide software and business management tools, third-party claims administration, first notice of loss and network management services to the U.S. auto insurers, glass repair facilities and suppliers specializing in glass claims. Our services allow insurance companies to cost-effectively handle glass claims while providing high levels of customer service to their customers. In addition, through our software services, we allow glass repair facilities to operate more efficiently through enhanced workflow and scheduling.

Through the use of our products and services, we can now deliver efficiency, standardization and transparency to the property repair process. Insurers face many of the same challenges in property insurance claims as in auto collision repair: _Claims process fragmentation_ The property insurance claims process involves many parties and consists of many steps, which are often managed through paper, fax and other labor intensive processes. Our software and services simplify and streamline the claims process, allowing our customers to process claims faster and reduce their costs. _Asymmetrical information_ Property repair contractors typically have more information about the repair process than do insurance companies who often must make their damage estimates remotely or with limited information. Our databases provide insurance companies access to detailed information about property damage, repair times and replacement costs, allowing them to more accurately estimate fair settlement values and reduce overpayment on claims. _Disparate claims data_ Claims-related data generated by property insurance companies often is not stored, shared with other parties or captured in a format that is easily transferable to other applications.

OEMs typically provide a warranty on new vehicles for a period of years or miles covered. These warranties cover specified repairs and sometimes maintenance during the warranty period and these services are typically performed at the automobile dealer. Motor vehicle service is a series of maintenance procedures carried out at a set time interval or after the vehicle has travelled a certain distance. The vehicle manufacturer specifies service intervals and some modern cars display the due date for the next service electronically on the instrument panel. There are 16,400 automobile dealers in the United States. According to the NADA, in 2014, warranty work performed by franchised dealers was valued at $17.1 billion in service and parts—all at no cost to the vehicle owner. Additionally, NADA estimated Americans spent a total of $91.7 billion at franchised dealerships in 2014 for repairs, maintenance, tires, batteries, oil and accessories for automobiles and light trucks used in personal transportation. After the OEM warranty expires, vehicle owners typically have their vehicles serviced and maintained at either an automobile dealer or at chain or independent repair facility. 132 ----- There are approximately 275,000 chain and independent repair facilities in the United States. An NHTSA analysis led to a primary estimate that approximately 40% of the costs associated with auto repair were unnecessary.

We seek acquisition targets with strong, entrepreneurial management teams that can be incented to drive achievement of targets, often in conjunction with performance based earn-outs. We seek acquisition targets that can achieve acceptable margin levels within a reasonable amount of time. Finally, acquisition targets must have a strategic fit with our core operations. Acquisition targets that meet our MMC hurdles are then subject to achievement of certain ROIC thresholds. We have completed 40 transactions since 2006, and the acquired targets had an average adjusted EBITDA margin at the closing of each transaction of 35.5%, which improved to an average of 43.5% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Purchase multiple performance, defined as the weighted average multiple paid at the closing of the transactions compared to the weighted average invested capital multiple of EBITDA for the twelve months ended on the one-year anniversary of the completion of the respective acquisition, was 12.7x at closing versus 11.0x for the last twelve months ended December 31, 2015.

Leverage refers to expanding our geographic footprint to increase the number of claims we process and to increase the number of services we provide in each claim to drive incremental return on investment for our insurance customers. Once a new market begins to adopt our electronic claims processing solutions and as our revenue-per-claim increases as we provide higher returns on investment to our customers, we enjoy scale benefits associated with our business model. As our penetration of electronic claims processing increases in a geography, we begin to diversify to add more services to our auto platform as well as our customer’s customer and property platforms. These diversifications add to our growth opportunities while diversifying from a reliance on collisionrelated claims. 144 ----- Our current focus is to disrupt the market by connecting our platforms and enabling the digital lifestyles of our customer’s customer. Thus, we envision the auto as another smart appliance within the home and with the owners looking to use digital tools to manage their auto and home ownership experiences including purchase, maintenance and accident repair. Recent horizontal and vertical expansion of our platforms also provides us with an opportunity to increase portfolio bundling of our offerings and opportunities to cross-sell additional solutions to our existing and new customers to derive more revenue per customer and leverage core strengths of our platform. We plan to execute our strategy while continuously improving productivity and eliminating waste. We have historically demonstrated a consistent track record of profitable growth and waste reduction. Between fiscal year 2007 and 2014, we achieved approximately $95 million in waste reduction. Midway through fiscal year 2015, we announced that we raised our target to $30 to $40 million in annualized synergies and waste reduction, of which half was realized during the remainder of fiscal year 2015. Additionally, we have improved margins in existing and acquired business via standard continuous productivity improvement and waste elimination practices. For example, for 38 out of 40 fiscal quarters prior to our purchase of AutoPoint, AutoPoint generated a negative EBITDA margin. AutoPoint’s EBITDA margin has remained positive and significantly improved during our ownership.

1796,Offerings 2016.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.59,Growth in our Markets,17.59.1,,"The primary growth drivers for our industry are the number insurance claims made, as well as the size, growth and age of the car parc. The increase in overall size and age of the car parc drives need for vehicle service, maintenance and repair along with customer retention tools for our customers, in addition, the frequency of collisions drives the number of insurance claims made. Management estimates the global number of automotive claims will reach approximately 165 million for 2020, growing at a CAGR of 6.3% from the 2015 estimate of approximately 122 million claims. The chart below depicts the global annual historical and projected vehicle unit sales in millions for Advanced Markets and the rest of the world. Global car parc (all light vehicles) 1,800 1,600 1,400 1,200 1,000 800 600 400 200 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Advanced(US,Canada,Western Europe,and Japan) Rest of the World According to industry sources, global new light vehicle sales grew by 4.0% in 2014 to 90.0 million units and sales are forecasted to reach 92.2 million units, up by 2.5%, in 2015. In Advanced Markets, sales are projected to grow at a 1.0% CAGR from 2014 through 2024. In other markets, sales are projected to grow at a 6.0% CAGR from 2014 through 2024. Fewer new light vehicle sales can result in fewer insured vehicles on the road and fewer automobile accidents, which can reduce the transactionbased fees that we generate. 146 ----- The industry sources also estimate that the average age of vehicles is increasing across the globe. In the United States, the average age of vehicles is 11.4 years, an increase of 1.5% CAGR since 2003. In Emerging Markets, the average age of vehicles is increasing at a faster pace. For example, in China the average age of vehicles is expected to be 5 years in 2016, growing at a CAGR of 4.0% from 2011 to 2016. Average age of vehicles in U.S. (years) Average age of vehicles in China (years) 9.7 9.8 9.8 9.9 10.0 [10.1 10.3 10.6 10.9 11.2 11.4 11.4] 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 5.0 4.1 2011 2016E Another growth driver is the insurance industry focus on increasing claims processing efficiency and reducing claims cost severity. Digitalizing claims processing can result in significant cost savings, improved cycle time, customer experience and agility for insurers. Based on a study from a leading consulting firm commissioned by Solera, currently 30% of claims processes at insurers account for 80% of the time of their full time employees, with significant potential to increase digitalization. The cost of digitized claims processing software and services generally represents a relatively small portion of automobile insurance companies’ claims costs. We believe automobile insurance companies will increase their spending on digitized claims processing software and services that improve their customers experience because such incremental investments can result in significant cost reductions and customer satisfaction improvements. Each of these factors influences industry growth differently in our three market types, as detailed below. Advanced Markets._** In our Advanced Markets, automobile insurance is generally governmentmandated and claims processing is generally automated. Automobile insurance companies achieve growth in these highly competitive markets by gaining additional market share and generally compete on price, quality and range of policyholder service. To remain competitive, insurance companies increasingly seek additional automated claims processing products and services to minimize costs and improve policyholder service. In these markets, the car parc is stable. For example, in the United States, the number of registered vehicles declined in 2012 and increased in 2013 and 2014, while the average vehicle age has been increasing. The chart below depicts the number of light vehicle registrations in the United States (20022015E). 230.5 235.2 239.2 243.0 246.3 249.3 251.9 252.2 249.4 249.5 248.7 248.8 252.6 257.9 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015E Vehicle Registrations (in millions) _Source: Autocare Association Factbook (2016)_ As vehicles become more complex, it results in an increase in claim severity and a higher RpC, which we define as the total revenue derived from vehicle collision claims in advanced markets divided by the number of such claims. For example, in our Advanced Markets (Western Europe for RpC), RpC grew from $25.64 for the three months ended December 31, 2013 to $28.24 for the three months ended December 31, 2015. 147 ----- Evolving Markets._** In our Evolving Markets, the car parc is generally growing. Automobile insurance companies achieve growth in these markets by focusing on writing new vehicle insurance policies and increasing market share. A significant number of claims are processed manually in these markets, presenting opportunities for insurance companies to increase their operational efficiencies by automating claims processing. Emerging Markets._** In our Emerging Markets, the car parc is growing at the fastest rate among the three market types. Automobile insurance companies achieve growth in these markets by focusing on writing new vehicle insurance policies and increasing market share. The vast majority of claims are processed manually or using homegrown solutions in these markets, presenting opportunities for insurance companies to increase their operational efficiencies by digitizing claims processing and leveraging global OEM data and repair methods.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

Additionally, more cars and an aging car parc will increase demand for our SMR and CRM platforms, as the global car parc is expected to increase to 1.5 billion cars by year 2020 (from 1.2 billion currently) and as the average vehicle stays longer on the road (average age of a vehicle in the United States has increased to 11.4 years in 2014, from 9.7 years in 2003).

Long-term Relationships with a Large and Diverse Customer Base._** We serve over 195,000 customers in more than 75 countries across six continents.

High Visibility from Recurring Revenue Base._** A substantial portion of our revenues are derived from customers who have used our software and services for many years. Our customer retention is very high because of long-standing customer relationships and the integration of our claims processing software and services into our customers’ systems. In addition, we have subscription-based or transaction-based contracts with many of our customers. As a result, 97% of our revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were recurring.

Mr. Aquila and AGR have supported our development by hosting numerous events at the ranch and, at AGR’s expense, renovating several facilities on the premises. The ranch has been used for various company-related purposes, including: functions intended to foster client, partner and vendor relations as well as business and corporate development; global employee training and team building; management retreats; and employee excellence awards. Prior to February 11, 2013, we used the ranch without charge. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has determined that our use of the ranch in the past and going forward has been and is beneficial to our business. On February 11, 2013, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee approved entering into a Facilities Use Agreement and an Indemnification Agreement between us and AGR, which agreements govern our use of the ranch. Under the Facilities Use Agreement, we paid AGR a fixed annual fee of $140,000 (the “Fee”) for use of the facilities during calendar year 2013. The fee was determined by multiplying the estimated daily operating costs of the ranch by an assumed number of days that we will use the ranch, which use is based on our historical and expected future use. In approving the amount of the fee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the independent members of the Board considered the rates charged by comparable third-party facilities in the vicinity of the ranch and determined that the Fee is lower than the amounts we would pay for the use of such comparable facilities. The Facilities Use Agreement automatically renews on an annual basis unless either party provides the other party 30 days written notice of termination. Under the Facilities Use Agreement, we are also obligated to pay out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with, and replenish expendable goods used as a result of, our use of the ranch. The Indemnification Agreement provides that we will indemnify AGR and certain other indemnitees for any claims, demands, causes of action and damages that may arise out of our use of the ranch. In accordance with the Audit Committee’s charter, the Audit Committee will periodically, and at least annually, review our use of the ranch, the Fee, the Facilities Use Agreement and the Indemnification Agreement. On December 26, 2013, we entered into an amendment to the Facilities Use Agreement with AGR and Chaparral Lane Investment, LLC (“CLI”), an entity owned by our Mr. Aquila and his family, to (i) add an additional facility in Roanoke, Texas to the Facilities Use Agreement and (ii) increase the fixed annual fee to $170,000 in exchange for our use during calendar year 2014 of the Wyoming Facility. This fee increase is due to increased operating expenses of the Wyoming Facility and an increase in the number of days during which we use the Wyoming Facility. On December 31, 2014, we executed another amendment to the Facilities Use Agreement to: (i) increase the fixed annual fee paid by us to AFV for our use of the Wyoming Facility to $272,250, and (ii) provide for a true-up payment by us to AFV to the extent that our actual use of the Wyoming Facility during a calendar year exceeds the assumed use for that calendar year, which assumed use was a basis for the fixed annual fee. The trueup payments paid by us to AFV for calendar years 2014 and 2015 were $63,270 and $101,640, respectively.

All of our investments prior to April 7, 2015 in the Innovation Center have been made in accordance with the Facilities Use Agreement and all our investments on or after April 7, 2015 in the Innovation Center have been made in accordance with the Lease Agreement. To provide us with continued, exclusive, long-term rights to use the Innovation Center and to protect our investment in the improvements to the Innovation Center, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee approved the Lease Agreement. The material terms of the Lease Agreement are described below. ‰ Term: The term of the Lease Agreement is 20 years. We have an option (the “Option”) to extend the lease for an additional 5-year term immediately following expiration of the initial 20year term (the “Option Term”). ‰ Payment Obligations: The monthly lease payment is $10,000. The monthly lease payment is determined by multiplying Mr. Aquila’s invested capital in the Innovation Center ($1.5 million) by 0.08 and dividing this product by twelve. Based on the unique nature of the Innovation Center and our discussions with commercial real estate professionals in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex regarding commercial lease rates in the vicinity of the Innovation Center, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that our monthly lease payment to CLI is not above current market rates. The monthly lease payment is subject to adjustment in accordance with a consumer price index after year 5, year 10, year 15 and, if we exercise the Option, year 20. We are also responsible for property taxes, maintenance and insurance for the Innovation Center. ‰ Termination of the Lease by Us: We can terminate the Lease Agreement during the initial 10 years of the lease term, following two years’ prior notice; during years 11—15 of the lease term, following one year’s prior notice; and after year 15 of the lease term, following 90 day’s prior notice. During the Option Term (if we exercise the Option), we can terminate the Lease Agreement following one year’s prior notice. ‰ Termination of the Lease by CLI: CLI can terminate the Lease Agreement following an uncured breach of the Lease Agreement by us. 158 ----- ‰ Termination of the Lease by Either Party: Either party may terminate the Lease Agreement following certain catastrophic events, such as fire at or condemnation of the Innovation Center. ‰ Assignment of the Lease Agreement by Us: We may assign the Lease Agreement or sublet the Innovation Center with CLI’s prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld. ‰ CLI’s Right to Transfer: CLI has the right to transfer its interests in the Innovation Center. ‰ Our Option to Purchase the Innovation Center: In the event CLI decides to sell the Innovation Center during the initial Lease term or the Option Term, we have the right to purchase the Innovation Center from CLI at the Offer Price (as defined below). The “Offer Price” during the initial Lease term is (i) $1,500,000 plus (ii) an amount that delivers to CLI interest on $1,500,000 at an annual rate equal to 10% compounded monthly from and after April 7, 2015 to the time of settlement for the purchase (the “Settlement Date”) less (iii) the aggregate monthly lease payments received by CLI through the Settlement Date (the “Received Rent”) adjusted to the present value of the Received Rent at an annual interest rate equal to 10% compounded monthly from and after the applicable payment date to the Settlement Date (the “Offer Price Formula”). The “Offer Price” during the Option Term shall be an amount equal to the greater of the price derived from the Offer Price Formula and the price set forth in a written offer to purchase the Innovation Center delivered by a bona fide third party to CLI. Concurrent with the execution of the Lease Agreement, the parties to the Facilities Use Agreement executed an amendment to the Facilities Use Agreement removing all of the parties’ going forward rights and obligations relating to the Innovation Center.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each Domestic Subsidiary (other than the Co-Issuer and any Excluded Subsidiaries) that is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Company that incurs or guarantees any Obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or certain future Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Guarantor (and any Foreign Subsidiary or Domestic Subsidiary that is a non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiary (in each case, other than any Excluded Subsidiary) if such Foreign Subsidiary or nonWholly-Owned Subsidiary guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, certain syndicated bank indebtedness or certain capital markets debt securities of the Issuers or any Guarantor). Each of the Guarantees of the Notes will be a general unsecured obligation of each Guarantor and will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness and other obligations of each such entity that are not, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future Secured Indebtedness and other obligations of each such entity (including obligations of such entity under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such Indebtedness and other obligations, and will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of each such entity. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the Indebtedness and other obligations of Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Co-Issuer) that do not Guarantee the Notes. Not all of the Company’s Subsidiaries in existence on the date of the Acquisition will Guarantee the Notes, and Restricted Subsidiaries will be required to Guarantee the Notes only to the extent provided for under “Certain Covenants—Guarantors.” In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuers. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Subsidiaries of the Company that are not expected to guarantee the Notes generated 51.9% of the Company’s consolidated revenues and 63.9% of the Company’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, at December 31, 2015, excluding the effect of intercompany balances as well as intercompany transactions, these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries held approximately 33.2% of the Company’s total consolidated assets and had approximately $251.5 million of the Company’s consolidated total liabilities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related our Indebtedness and the Notes—The notes and the note guarantees are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.” We expect that all of the Company’s Subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuer) existing as of the Issue Date will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” However, under certain circumstances, we will be permitted to designate certain of our future subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes. Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed Obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. 163 ----- The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent such Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law and, therefore, are limited to the amount that such Guarantor could guarantee without such Guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance; this limitation, however, may not be effective to prevent such Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance. If a Guarantee is rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of such Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and/or the note guarantees and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.” A Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that its Obligations under the Indenture and its Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) (a) any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (by merger, consolidation, amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor, after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor; provided that such sale, exchange, transfer or disposition of Capital Stock or assets is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture (including any amendments thereof); (b) the release or discharge of (or, substantially concurrently with the release of the Guarantee of such Guarantor, the Guarantor will be released and discharged from) the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor with respect to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the release or discharge of (or, substantially concurrently with the release of the Guarantee of such Guarantor, the Guarantor will be released and discharged from) such other guarantee or direct obligation that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct obligation (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent release is still a release); (c) the proper designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, an Excluded Subsidiary or an Immaterial Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (d) the Issuers exercising their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the Issuers’ obligations under the Indenture being satisfied and discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; (e) (i) the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Company, the Co-Issuer or another Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger, amalgamation or consolidation, or (ii) the liquidation or dissolution of such Guarantor following the transfer of all or substantially all of its assets to the Company, the Co-Issuer or another Guarantor; (f) subject to customary contingent reinstatement obligations, upon payment in full of the aggregate principal amount of all Notes then outstanding and other Obligations then due and owing; or (g) as described under “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”; and (2) the Company delivering to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with.

The unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; (8) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and describing each such condition, and, if applicable, stating that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion), or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that the Issuers shall determine that the Change of Control will not occur by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and (9) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuers, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control or conditioned upon such Change of Control, with a purchase date to occur upon, or within a specified period of time after, the consummation of such Change of Control. 173 ----- If the Change of Control Payment Date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, then any accrued and unpaid interest to the Change of Control Payment Date will be paid on the Change of Control Payment Date to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close of business on such record date. While the Notes are in global form and if the Issuers make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations. The Issuers will comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the applicable provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered, and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuers. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Company or the Co-Issuer become a party may prohibit or limit the Issuers from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuers will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture after any required giving of notice and lapse of time as described under, “Events of Default and Remedies.” The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will, and future credit agreements or other debt agreements to which the Company or the Co-Issuer becomes a party may, provide that certain change of control events with respect to the Company would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such other Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance our Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and such other Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and such other Indebtedness being declared due and payable. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—We may not be able to purchase the notes upon a change of control, which would result in a default under the indenture that will govern the notes and would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.” 174 ----- In the event that the Issuers make a Change of Control Payment, the paying agent will promptly mail or wire transfer to each Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Change of Control Offer feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Company (or any Parent Entity) and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Offer feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers of the Notes and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control following the Issue Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuers, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuers as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuers or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 15 days nor more than 60 days’ prior notice as described under the heading “Optional Redemption—Selection and Notice” (provided that such notice is given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above), to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding to, but excluding, the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the Redemption Date). The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than a Permitted Holder. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived, amended or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. 175 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

Within 450 days after the Company’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale (the “Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period”), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (1) to repurchase, prepay or redeem: (a) any Indebtedness secured by a Permitted Lien (and, if such Indebtedness is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto); 176 ----- (b) Obligations under the Notes or any Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that if the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall so repay any Pari Passu Indebtedness other than the Notes, the Company will either (A) reduce Obligations under the Notes on a pro rata basis by, at its option, (i) redeeming Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or any equivalent provision with respect to any Additional Notes or (ii) purchasing Notes through openmarket purchases, or (B) make an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes on a ratable basis with such other Pari Passu Indebtedness, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), for no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, thereon; or (c) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor (and, if such Indebtedness is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto), other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary; or (2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses operating or engaged in a Similar Business (provided that if such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock, such acquisition results in the Company or another of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary); (b) capital expenditures; or (c) acquisitions of other properties or assets, in each of the foregoing subclauses (b) and (c), used or useful in a Similar Business or that replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; or (3) any combination of the foregoing; _provided, that a binding commitment entered into not later than such 450th day shall be treated as a_ permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such manner within the later of 450 days from the consummation of the Asset Sale and 180 days from the date of the Acceptable Commitment, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination and such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such manner within 180 days from the date of the Second Commitment; provided, further, that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds to the extent the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period has expired. Any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph (it being understood that any portion of such Net Proceeds used to make an offer to purchase Notes, as described in clause (1) above, shall be deemed to have been invested whether or not such offer is accepted) will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $50.0 million, the Issuers shall make an offer to all Holders and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase (or redeem or repay, as applicable) the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is, with respect to the Notes only, in an amount equal to at least $2,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000 thereafter, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, with respect to the Notes only, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, as applicable), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the 177 ----- Indenture and, if applicable, the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuers will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 10 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $50.0 million (the “Asset Sale Purchase Date”) by mailing or electronically sending (in PDF or similar format) the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Proceeds prior to the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (the “Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a part of the available Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture. If the Asset Sale Purchase Date is on or after an applicable interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, then any accrued and unpaid interest to the Asset Sale Purchase Date will be paid on the Asset Sale Purchase Date to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close of business on such record date. To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture, and they will no longer constitute Excess Proceeds. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered in an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Trustee shall select the Notes and the Issuers shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased or repaid on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes in global form, the Trustee will select Notes for redemption based on the method of DTC that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection or by such other method that the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate) based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness not denominated in U.S. dollars, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into the U.S. dollar equivalent determined as of the Business Day immediately prior to the date on which the Asset Sale Offer is announced. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion), and in the case of an Advance Offer, the amount of Net Proceeds the Issuers are offering to apply in such Advance Offer shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds. Additionally, upon consummation or expiration of any Advance Offer, any remaining Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuers may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Company hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to promptly take all commercially reasonable actions available under the applicable local law to permit such repatriation), and once such repatriation of any such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, such amount (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) at such time shall be considered the Net Proceeds in respect of an Asset Sale and (ii) to the extent that the Company has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition would have a material adverse Tax consequence (which for the avoidance of 178 ----- doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any repatriation whereby doing so the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary, or any of their respective affiliates and/or equity owners would incur a material tax liability, including as a result of a dividend or deemed dividend, or a material withholding tax, but taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit received in connection with such repatriation) with respect to such Net Proceeds, the Net Proceeds so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary. Pending the final application of an amount equal to the Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Company or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility (including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuers will comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the applicable provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under the Asset Sale provisions described in the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Company (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this Asset Sales covenant. In the event the Issuers are contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, could seek the consent of its respective lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuers will remain contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture after any required giving of notice and lapse of time as described under “Events of Default and Remedies.” The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an Asset Sale Offer, including the definition of “Asset Sale,” may be waived, amended or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of the applicable series then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

The period of time between (and including) the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date (but excluding the Reversion Date) is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” In the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes; provided that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments made on or after the Reversion Date, the amount of Restricted Payments made will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period, (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” (3) no Subsidiaries shall be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during any Suspension Period, (4) any Affiliate Transaction entered into on or after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates,” (5) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (a) of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” and (6) no Subsidiary of the Company shall be required to comply with the covenant described under “—Guarantees” on or after the Reversion Date with respect to any guarantee entered into by such Subsidiary during the Suspension Period. During the Suspension Period, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens to the extent provided for under “—Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens). To the extent such covenant and any Permitted Liens refer to one or more Suspended Covenants, such covenant or definition shall be interpreted as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for purposes of the “—Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” definition and for no other covenant). Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and 180 ----- (2) following a Reversion Date, the Company and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

Interest on a Financing Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company to be the rate of interest implicit in such Financing Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate as the Company or the Co-Issuer may designate. “Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum, without duplication, of: (1) Consolidated Interest Expense of such Person for such period; 230 ----- (2) all cash dividends or other distributions paid (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any series of Preferred Stock of such Person during such period; and (3) all cash dividends or other distributions paid or accrued (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any series of Disqualified Stock of such Person during such period. “Foreign Subsidiary” means, with respect to any Person, any Restricted Subsidiary other than a Domestic Subsidiary. “GAAP” means (1) generally accepted accounting principles in the United States as in effect from time to time; provided that all terms of an accounting or financial nature used in the Indenture shall be construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to in the Indenture shall be made (a) without giving effect to any election under FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 825— _Financial Instruments, or any successor thereto (including pursuant to the FASB Accounting Standards_ Codification), to value any Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary at “fair value,” as defined therein and (b) the amount of any Indebtedness under GAAP with respect to Financing Lease Obligations shall be determined in accordance with the definition of Financing Lease Obligation or (2) if elected by the Company (the “IFRS Election”) by written notice to the Trustee in connection with the delivery of financial statements and information, the accounting standards and interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standard Board (“IFRS”), as in effect on the first date of the period for which the Company is making such election; provided, that (a) any such election, once made, shall be irrevocable and (b) from and after the date of the IFRS Election, (i) all financial statements and reports required to be provided after such election pursuant to the Indenture shall be prepared on the basis of IFRS, (ii) all ratios, financial definitions, computations and other determinations based on GAAP contained in the Indenture shall be computed in conformity with IFRS, (iii) all references in the Indenture to GAAP shall be deemed to be references to IFRS, (iv) all references in the Indenture to the Financial Accounting Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants or any successor thereto shall be deemed to be references to the International Accounting Standards Board or any successor thereto and (v) accounting terms not defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings given to them under IFRS; provided that any such term phrased in a manner customary under GAAP shall be interpreted to refer to the equivalent accounting or financial concept under IFRS and, if there is no such equivalent accounting or financial concept, shall be interpreted in a manner that best approximates the effect that such term would have if it were construed in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the Issue Date.

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. 251 ----- DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants. The participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “indirect participants”). Persons who are not participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the participants or the indirect participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the participants and indirect participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the participants) or by the participants and the indirect participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes). Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are participants in such system. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of participants, which in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

Under the terms of the indenture, the Issuers and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuers, the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuers or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its participants or indirect participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the participants and the indirect participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the participants or the indirect participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuers.

The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period.

OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the stated principal amount and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. Special rules will apply for calculating OID for an initial short accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a note at the beginning of any accrual period is equal to its issue price increased by the accrued OID, if any, for each prior accrual period.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuers, a guarantor or an initial purchaser is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive nor should it be construed as legal advice.

The initial offering price is set forth on the cover page of this offering circular. After the notes are released for sale, the initial purchasers may change the offering price and other selling terms. The offering of the notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. Each initial purchaser has agreed that it will only offer or sell the notes (A) in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and (B) outside the United States to non-United States persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. In connection with sales outside the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or for the account or benefit of, United States persons (i) as part of the initial purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date the notes are originally issued. The initial purchasers will send to each dealer to whom it sells such notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, United States persons. In addition, with respect to notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of this offering or the date the notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Issuers and the guarantors will agree in the purchase agreement, subject to certain exceptions, that for a period of 90 days after the date of this offering circular, neither it nor any of the guarantors will, without the prior written consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co., offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities that are substantially similar to the notes. The notes are new issuances of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to list the notes on any national securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated 269 ----- dealer quotation system. There can be no assurance that the prices at which the notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue after this offering. We have been advised by the initial purchasers that the initial purchasers intend to make a market in the notes but are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes while the offering is in progress. The initial purchasers also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular initial purchaser repays to the initial purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because Goldman, Sachs & Co. or its affiliates have repurchased notes sold by or for the account of such initial purchaser in stabilizing or short covering transactions. These activities by the initial purchasers, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the initial purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. The Issuers and the guarantors have agreed to indemnify the several initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. An investor has indicated an interest in acquiring notes and has negotiated separate terms with Goldman, Sachs & Co. for an option to acquire $400 million of notes prior to March 31, 2016. Goldman, Sachs & Co. will earn fees and expenses in connection with the option, and will be allocated $400 million in connection with the offering so that it can deliver notes pursuant to the option, if exercised. The payment and other terms of this option are different from, and could be deemed more favorable to such investor than, the initial offering terms as described herein.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index on page F-1. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Solera Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,334.5.7,Goodwill and Intangible Assets,"Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment on April 1 of each fiscal year. Impairment indicators arise when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant downturn in industry or economic trends with a direct impact on the business, an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of for less than the carrying value, loss of key personnel, or a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group. We test goodwill for impairment annually at a reporting unit level using a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with F-9 ----- their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the potential impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. In our annual goodwill impairment assessment for fiscal year 2015, we concluded that the fair values of the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned exceeded their respective carrying values and, accordingly, we did not identify any goodwill impairment. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets at the unit of accounting level by making a determination of the fair value of the intangible asset. If the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference. We also evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets that are not subject to amortization on an annual basis to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If an intangible asset that is not being amortized is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, that asset is tested for impairment. After recognition of the impairment, if any, the asset is amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. In our annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment for fiscal year 2015, we concluded that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying value and, accordingly, we did not identify any impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Intangible assets with finite lives primarily consist of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and the costs associated with software developed for internal use. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives acquired in business combinations on an accelerated basis to reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed. Costs associated with software developed for internal use are amortized over three- to five- years on a straight-line basis.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used, the loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, significant negative industry or economic trends or the presence of other factors that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable. We consider a long-lived asset to be impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset. If we deem an asset to be impaired, the amount of the impairment loss represents the excess of the asset’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

Our multiple element arrangements primarily include a combination of software licenses, hosted database and other services, installation and set-up services, hardware, maintenance services and transaction-based deliverables. We generate a significant majority of our revenue from subscription-based contracts (where a monthly fee is charged), transaction-based contracts (where a fee per transaction is charged) and subscription-based contracts with additional transaction-based fees (where a monthly fee and a fee per transaction are charged). Subscription-based and transaction-based contracts generally include the delivery of software, access to our database through a hosted service, upfront fees for the implementation and set-up activities necessary for the client to use/access the software and maintenance. Under a subscription arrangement, we consider delivery of software, access to the hosted database and maintenance to be a combined unit of accounting and recognize related revenues at the end of each month upon the completion of the monthly service. A transaction-based fee represents a payment for the right to use the software, access to the hosted database and maintenance. We consider the fee to be fixed and determinable only at the time actual usage occurs, and, accordingly, we recognize revenue at the time of actual usage. Implementation services and set-up activities are necessary for the client to receive services/ software. We defer up-front fees billed during the implementation/set-up phase and recognize such revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated customer life. Recognition of this deferred revenue will commence upon the start of the monthly service.

We translate our local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period for our consolidated statement of income and certain components of stockholders’ equity, and the exchange rate at the end of that period for our consolidated balance sheet. These translations resulted in net foreign currency translation adjustments of $(167.7) million and $39.1 million in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. The foreign currency translation adjustment in fiscal year 2015 was caused by a strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar versus certain foreign currencies, including the Euro, during the period. Generally, this strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in decreases to the U.S. dollar value of certain of our assets and liabilities from June 30, 2014 to June 30, 2015, as presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, although the corresponding local currency balances may have increased or remain unchanged.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws to taxable years in which such differences are expected to reverse. As part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing for tax returns for such periods. This process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences, or reversing book-tax differences, resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities. F-13 ----- We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable using the morelikely-than-not standard. In our assessment, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If we determine that our deferred tax assets do not meet the more-likely-than-not standard, we establish a valuation allowance.

CAP is a provider of real-time, high-accuracy valuations and specifications for new and used vehicles in the United Kingdom. CAP’s solutions provide pricing transparency for vehicle transactions and enable buyers and sellers of vehicles to make accurate pricing decisions. We financed the acquisition of CAP through the issuance of additional senior unsecured notes as well as cash on hand. CAP has been assigned to our EMEA segment. We have included the results of operations of CAP in our consolidated statements of income from the acquisition date. Revenues and net income earned by CAP were $27.2 million and $3.4 million respectively, for the period from the acquisition date through June 30, 2015. We have accounted for the acquisition of CAP under the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the total purchase price has been allocated to the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill. Of the purchase price for CAP, we have preliminarily allocated £185.8 million $293.3 million to goodwill and £122.7 million $193.6 million to identifiable intangible assets. The goodwill recorded in the acquisition represents future enhancements to the software and database, future customer relationships and markets, and the workforce.

Operating under the brand names of LYNX Services, GTS Services, and GLAXIS, I&S is a leading provider of software and business management tools, third-party claims administration, first notice of loss and network management services to the U.S. auto and property repair industries, specializing in glass claims. The acquisition of I&S allows us to expand our relationship with insurance companies in the U.S. and abroad with workflow tools and third-party management services for glass, property, and collision claims as well as providing business management solutions to a broad network of auto repair and flat glass retailers.

SRS is a leading U.S. provider in the service, maintenance and repair market with proprietary databases and workflow solutions used by mechanical repair shops and auto dealers. Upon the closing of the SRS transaction, we had control of SRS as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and therefore consolidated its assets, liabilities, and financial results from the closing date. The acquisition of SRS allows us to expand our reach deeper into household decisions related to the total cost of automobile ownership. SRS has been included in our Americas segment. We have included the results of operations of SRS in our consolidated statements of income (loss) from the acquisition date. Revenues earned and net income reported by SRS were $74.0 million and $3.3 million, respectively, for the period from the acquisition date through June 30, 2014. We have the right to acquire the remaining 50% equity ownership interest of SRS (the “Call Right”) at a price, subject to certain adjustments, equal to the greater of (a) a specified multiple of WCAS’s cost basis of such equity ownership interest, and (b) a per share equity value based on a specified multiple of SRS’s trailing twelve month EBITDA (the “TTM EBITDA”), as defined in the stockholders agreement between us, WCAS and the other parties thereto (the “Stockholders Agreement”). On July 16, 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity ownership interest in SRS from WCAS (Note 17). F-19 ----- In addition, under the Stockholders Agreement, we had the right to acquire 100% ownership interest in two subsidiaries of SRS, AutoPoint, LLC and Mobile Productivity, LLC. (together, “AutoPoint”), from SRS. We exercised our right and completed the acquisition of AutoPoint in April 2014. The acquisition resulted in tax deductible goodwill of $6.2 million. WCAS has the right to require that we purchase its equity ownership interest in SRS up to four times per year, subject to an annual cap of $250 million and a $25 million per exercise minimum (the “Annual Put Right”) at a price based on the TTM EBITDA. In addition, WCAS has additional rights to require that we purchase either half or all (depending on the triggering event) of their equity ownership interest of SRS at a price, subject to certain adjustments, equal to a specified multiple of WCAS’s cost basis of such equity ownership interest (the “Special Put Right”). The triggering events for the Special Put Right include, among others, a drop in our corporate credit rating below certain specified levels or if SRS is required to become a guarantor of any of the indebtedness of Solera or its subsidiaries (other than SRS) or at any time beginning on August 1, 2018 and ending on the earlier of (x) December 31, 2018 and (y) the consummation of any Annual Put Right after August 1, 2018. On the acquisition date, we determined the fair value of the 50% noncontrolling ownership interest in SRS to be $289.2 million based primarily on our purchase price for 50% controlling ownership interest. Because the SRS noncontrolling interest is redeemable at other than fair value, we are accreting the carrying value to the redemption value at each reporting period through the earliest redemption date. Accordingly, at any point in time, the carrying value of the SRS noncontrolling interest represents the acquisition-date fair value, adjusted to reflect the noncontrolling owner’s share of net income, dividends paid to the noncontrolling owner, and acquisition of additional equity ownership interest in SRS by us, plus periodic accretion to the redemption value. Since the currently redeemable portion of the SRS noncontrolling interest is capped at $250 million, which is less than the acquisitiondate fair value of the noncontrolling interest, we are accreting the carrying value to the redemption value pursuant to the Special Put Right through August 1, 2018. Additionally, if the redemption value of the SRS noncontrolling interest were to exceed the fair value, the excess would result in an adjustment to the numerator in our calculation of net income per common share attributable to Solera Holdings, Inc. which could result in a decrease in our net income per share. The fair value of the SRS noncontrolling interest exceeded its redemption value at June 30, 2015. We have accounted for the acquisition of SRS under the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the total purchase price has been allocated to the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill. Of the purchase price for SRS, we have preliminarily allocated $398.8 million to goodwill and $248.4 million to identifiable intangible assets. The goodwill recorded in the acquisition represents future enhancements to the software and database, future customer relationships and markets, and the workforce.

In addition, $6.1 million related to the foreign tax credit carryforward, $0.6 million related to the U.S. federal research and development tax credit carryforward, and $0.4 million related to the U.S. state research and development tax credit carryforward are excluded from deferred income tax assets and liabilities as those amounts also relate to excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation deductions for which a tax benefit has not yet been realized. We have not recorded excess tax benefits of $9.4 million as of June 30, 2015 from excess stockbased compensation deductions for which a benefit has not yet been realized. Excess tax benefits F-42 ----- represent stock compensation deductions in excess of expenses recognized for financial reporting purposes and are realized when they reduce taxes payable, as determined using a “with and without” method. We have recorded valuation allowances for deferred tax assets of $48.1 million and $40.7 million at June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364
1796,Offerings 2016.md,334,LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY,334.19,"June 30, 2015** **2014",334.19.4,Unremitted Earnings,"Our foreign subsidiaries generate earnings that are not subject to U.S. income taxes so long as they are permanently reinvested in our operations outside of the U.S. Pursuant to ASC Topic No. 74030 (formerly APB 23), undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested would become subject to deferred income taxes under U.S. tax law. Prior to fiscal year 2015, we asserted that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were permanently reinvested. Primarily due to the increase in our U.S. debt service obligations resulting from the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million during fiscal year 2015 (Note 8) and the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $850.0 million in July 2015 (Note 17), management concluded that the ability to access certain amounts of foreign earnings would provide greater flexibility to meet domestic cash flow needs without constraining foreign objectives. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we withdrew the permanent reinvestment assertion on $350.0 million of earnings generated by certain of our foreign subsidiaries through fiscal year 2015. We provided for U.S. income taxes on the $350.0 million of undistributed foreign earnings, resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax liability of approximately $123.7 million. We recognized additional deferred income tax expense of $25.8 million related to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year 2015 on the portion of the $350.0 million of unremitted earnings generated prior to fiscal year 2015. There is no certainty as to the timing of when such foreign earnings will be distributed to the U.S. in whole or in part. Further, when the foreign earnings are distributed to the U.S., we anticipate that a substantial portion of the resulting U.S. income taxes due would be reduced by existing deferred tax assets. We have not provided for U.S. federal or foreign income taxes, including withholding taxes on $732.0 million of our non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings as of June 30, 2015. We continue to assert that the $732.0 million of undistributed earnings is permanently reinvested in our foreign operations and have no current plans to repatriate those earnings. If we were to distribute those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we could be subject to both U.S. and foreign income taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. It is currently not practicable to compute the residual taxes due on such earnings as we do not know the time or manner in which we would distribute these earnings.

On June 2, 2015, we entered into a $200.0 million Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) in connection with the completion of an acquisition. The Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured term loan in the amount of $200.0 million (the “Term Loan”), which was fully funded on June 2, 2015. The Term Loan matures no later than May 31, 2016 and bears interest based on the London interbank offered rate for Eurodollar rate loans or the Prime Rate, at our election, plus an applicable margin, with such applicable margin increasing by 0.50% per annum at the end of every 90 day period. The Term Loan currently bears interest at the London interbank offered rate for Eurodollar rate loans plus a 3.5% margin (4.25% as of June 30, 2015). We may prepay all or part of the Term Loan at any time without premium or penalty. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, we are required to prepay the Term Loan with the net proceeds of certain incurrences of indebtedness, equity issuances, asset sales and insurance/condemnation events. The Term Loan is guaranteed by Solera and certain of our domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries. Since the Term Loan was repaid using the proceeds from the issuance of additional senior unsecured notes in July 2015 (Note 17), the Term Loan has been classified as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2015. F-29 ----- We have issued senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “2021 Senior Notes”) pursuant to an indenture dated as of July 2, 2013 and senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “2023 Senior Notes”) pursuant to an indenture dated as of November 5, 2013. The 2021 Senior Notes accrue interest at 6.000% per annum, payable semi-annually, and become due and payable on June 15, 2021. The 2023 Senior Notes accrue interest at 6.125% per annum, payable semi-annually, and become due and payable on November 1, 2023. The 2021 Senior Notes include redemption provisions that allow us, at our option, to redeem all or a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes as follows: ‰ At any time prior to June 15, 2016, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 106.0% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of redemption. ‰ At any time prior to June 15, 2017, we may redeem the 2021 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The premium at the applicable redemption date is the greater of: (1) 1.0% of the then outstanding principal amount of the notes; or (2) the excess of: (a) the present value at such redemption date of the sum of the redemption price of the notes at June 15, 2017 plus all required interest payments due on the notes through June 15, 2017 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate as of such redemption date plus 50 basis points; over (b) the then outstanding principal amount of the notes. ‰ At any time on or after June 15, 2017, we may redeem the 2021 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at the following redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of redemption: (i) if the redemption occurs on or after June 15, 2017 but prior to June 15, 2018, the redemption price is 103.000% of the principal amount of the notes; (ii) if the redemption occurs on or after June 15, 2018 but prior to June 15, 2019, the redemption price is 101.500% of the principal amount of the notes; and (iii) if the redemption occurs on or after June 15, 2019, the redemption price is 100.000% of the principal amount of the notes. The 2023 Senior Notes include redemption provisions that allow us, at our option, to redeem all or a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Senior Notes as follows: ‰ At any time prior to November 1, 2016, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 106.125% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of redemption. ‰ At any time prior to November 1, 2018, we may redeem the 2023 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The premium at the applicable redemption date is the greater of: (1) 1.0% of the then outstanding principal amount of the notes; or (2) the excess of: (a) the present value at such redemption date of the sum of the redemption price of the notes at November 1, 2018 plus all required interest payments due on the notes through November 1, 2018 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate as of such redemption date plus 50 basis points over (b) the then outstanding principal amount of the notes. ‰ At any time on or after November 1, 2018, we may redeem the 2023 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at the following redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the F-30 ----- date of redemption: (i) if the redemption occurs on or after November 1, 2018 but prior to November 1, 2019, the redemption price is 103.063% of the principal amount of the notes; (ii) if the redemption occurs on or after November 1, 2019 but prior to November 1, 2020, the redemption price is 102.042% of the principal amount of the notes; (iii) if the redemption occurs on or after November 1, 2020 but prior to November 1, 2021, the redemption price is 101.021% of the principal amount of the notes; and (iv) if the redemption occurs on or after November 1, 2021, the redemption price is 100.000% of the principal amount of the notes. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we are required to offer to redeem the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 101.021% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the redemption date. In November 2013, we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes of $855.4 million, together with existing cash on hand, to redeem the outstanding senior unsecured notes due June 2018 (the “2018 Senior Notes”). The redemption price for the 2018 Senior Notes was $932.8 million, consisting of (i) the unpaid principal amount of $850.0 million, (ii) accrued unpaid interest through the redemption date of $24.4 million, and (iii) a redemption premium of $58.4 million. The redemption premium of $58.4 million, as well as the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the 2018 Senior Notes, net of the unamortized premium, of $1.8 million, were charged against earnings at the redemption date and are included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statement of income (loss) for fiscal year 2014. In July 2013, we used $289.5 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes to repay in full all of the outstanding term loans under our Amended and Restated First Lien Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the “Amended Credit Facility”), including accrued unpaid interest through the repayment date. Upon repayment of the outstanding term loans, the Amended Credit Facility was terminated. In connection with the termination of the Amended Credit Facility, we wrote-off the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the term loans of $3.1 million, which is included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statement of income (loss) for fiscal year 2014. The costs associated with the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes, the 2023 Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement are deferred and are included in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. We are amortizing these debt issuance costs to interest expense over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method. The indentures governing the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes contain limited covenants, including those restricting our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain liens, engage in sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge with, or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of our or their assets to, another person, and, in the case of any of our subsidiaries that did not issue or guarantee such notes, incur indebtedness. The Credit Agreement contains covenants substantially similar to those in the indentures governing the 2021 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes. We are in compliance with the specified covenants of the 2021 Senior Notes, the 2023 Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement at June 30, 2015.

Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash._ Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, primarily consist of bank deposits, money market funds and bank certificates of deposit. The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are determined using quoted market prices for identical assets (Level 1 inputs). Derivative financial instruments._ We estimate the fair value of our cross-currency swaps using standard valuation techniques that utilize market-based observable inputs to extrapolate future reset rates from period-end yield curves and standard valuation models based on a discounted cash flow model. Market-based observable inputs including spot and forward rates, volatilities and interest rate curves at observable intervals are used as inputs to the models (Level 2 inputs). Our estimate of fair value also considers the risk that the swap contracts will not be fulfilled. F-26 ----- Accrued contingent purchase consideration._ Contingent future cash payments related to business combinations that are not deemed to be compensatory are accrued at fair value as of the acquisition date. We re-assess the fair value measurement at each reporting date. Fair value is determined by estimating the present value of potential future cash payments that would be earned upon achievement by the acquired business of certain financial performance, product-related, integration and other objectives. Our estimate of fair value considers a range of possible cash payment scenarios using information available as of the reporting date, including the recent financial performance of the acquired businesses (Level 3 inputs).

We test goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level. We determine the fair value of our reporting units through a combination of an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow model, and a market approach, which considers comparable companies and transactions. Under the income approach, the discounted cash flow model determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of projected reporting unit cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period. Both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows. A weighted average cost of capital of a market participant is used as the discount rate. The residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period. Alternatively, the present value of the residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period. Under the market approach, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined based on multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for each reporting unit. The multiples were determined based on a selection of comparable companies and acquisition transactions, discounted for each reporting unit to reflect the relative size, diversification and risk of the reporting unit in comparison to the indexed companies and transactions. In our annual goodwill impairment assessment for fiscal year 2015, we concluded that the fair values of the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned exceeded their respective carrying values and, accordingly, we did not identify any goodwill impairment. We determine fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets under an income approach using the relief from royalty method, which assumes value to the extent that the acquired company is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the assets. In our annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment for fiscal year 2015, we concluded that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying value and, accordingly, we did not identify any impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Under the income approach, the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period. Both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows. A weighted average cost of capital of a market participant, which is an unobservable input, is used as the discount rate. The residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period. Alternatively, the present value of the residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period. Under the market approach, fair value is determined based on multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for each reporting unit. For our calculation, we determined the multiples based on a selection of comparable companies and acquisition transactions, discounted for each reporting unit to reflect the relative size, diversification and risk of the reporting unit in comparison to the indexed companies and transactions. Although we considered the fair value under both the income and market approaches, we estimated the fair value of our redeemable noncontrolling interests based solely upon the income approach, which utilizes a discounted cash flow model, a Level 3 input, as we believe this is the best indicator of fair value. The significant unobservable inputs in the discounted cash flow model include a discount rate and a long-term growth rate. The discount rate used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests as of June 30, 2015 using the income approach ranged between 12.8% and 16.5%, with a weighted average discount rate of 13.2%, reflecting a market participant’s perspective as a noncontrolling shareholder in a privately-held subsidiary. The F-27 ----- long-term growth rate used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests as of June 30, 2015 using the income approach was 4.0%.

We use derivatives to mitigate risks associated with this variability. We do not use derivatives for speculative purposes. The following is a summary of outstanding derivative financial instruments as of June 30, 2015: ‰ In April 2012, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swaps in the aggregate notional amount of €109.0 million. We pay Euro fixed coupon F-31 ----- payments at 6.990% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.750% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the swaps is June 15, 2018. These cross-currency swaps were designated, at inception, as cash flow hedges and we evaluate the swaps for effectiveness quarterly. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. To date, there has been no hedge ineffectiveness. ‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay floating / received fixed interest rate swap with a notional amount of $400.0 million. Under the terms of the interest rate swap, we pay quarterly floating coupon payments at 3-month LIBOR plus 3.924% and receive semi-annual fixed coupon payments at 6.000%. The maturity date of the interest rate swap is June 15, 2021, although the swap may be terminated at any time effective June 15, 2017 by the counterparty subject to the payment of a cancellation fee. The interest rate swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income. ‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars crosscurrency swap with a notional amount of €401.6 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.993% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is June 15, 2021. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income. ‰ In March 2015, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swap with a notional amount of €174.8 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.725% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is June 15, 2021. The cross-currency swap was designated as a net investment hedge at inception. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. To date, there has been no hedge ineffectiveness. ‰ In March 2015, we entered into a 60-day foreign exchange forward contract with a notional amount of €472.9 million. Under the terms of the forward contract, we pay predetermined forward rate on the settlement date. The foreign exchange forward contract was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income. In May 2015, we extended the settlement date of the foreign exchange forward contract to July 2015.

Subsequent Events,334.58.1,,"On July 16, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the equity interests in SRS currently held by WCAS for a purchase price of approximately $594.8 million, plus WCAS’ approximate share of SRS’s cash balance of $25.0 million (the “SRS Equity Buyout”). The purchase price payable in the SRS Equity Buyout was negotiated with WCAS and was not determined based on the existing call option or put option formulas provided in the stockholders agreement governing the SRS joint venture. Upon completion of the SRS Equity Buyout, we own 100% of the equity interests in SRS. We financed the SRS Equity Buyout using a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of additional senior unsecured notes (as described below). On July 16, 2015, we issued additional 2023 Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $850.0 million. The 2023 Senior Notes were issued at an original issue price of 99.50% plus accrued interest from May 1, 2015. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Senior Notes were used to finance the SRS Equity Buyout and repay the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. We intend to use any remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including continuing to actively seek, evaluate and potentially pursue strategic initiatives. Such strategic initiatives may include future acquisitions, joint ventures, investments or other business development opportunities. On July 17, 2015, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swaps, each with a notional amount of €137.0 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swaps, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.135% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swaps is November 1, 2018. One of the cross-currency swaps was designated as a net investment hedge at inception and one was not designated as a hedge at inception. We also entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swap with a notional amount of €274.0 million. Under the terms of the crosscurrency swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.585% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is November 1, 2023. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. In addition, we partially settled the foreign exchange forward contract and as a result incurred an $8.9 million realized loss. Settlement of the remaining foreign exchange forward contract notional amount was extended to July 2016. F-47 ----- On August 25, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors approved the payment of a cash dividend of $0.225 per share of outstanding common stock and per outstanding restricted stock unit. The dividends are payable on September 22, 2015 to stockholders and restricted stock unit holders of record at the close of business on September 8, 2015. Any determination to pay dividends in future periods will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. On January 28, 2016, we announced that the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors approved the payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.225 per share of outstanding common stock and per outstanding restricted stock unit. The dividends are payable on the earlier of the closing date of the Merger or March 1, 2016 to stockholders and restricted stock unit holders of record at the close of business on February 11, 2016.

In particular, we have historically experienced higher revenues during the second quarter and third quarter versus the first quarter and fourth quarter during each fiscal year. This seasonality is caused primarily by more days of inclement weather during the second quarter and third quarter in most of our markets, which contributes to a greater number of vehicle accidents and damage during these periods. In addition, our business is subject to fluctuations caused by other factors, including the occurrence of extraordinary weather events and the timing of certain public holidays. For example, the Easter holiday occurs during the third quarter in certain fiscal years and occurs during the fourth quarter in other fiscal years, resulting in a change in the number of business days during the quarter in which the holiday occurs.

(4) Net income (loss) attributable to Solera Holdings, Inc. and net income (loss) attributable to Solera Holdings, Inc. per common share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 reflects deferred income tax expense of approximately $149.5 million related to the withdrawal of the permanent reinvestment assertion on $350.0 million of earnings generated by certain of our foreign subsidiaries through fiscal year 2015 (Note 13). (5) Net income (loss) attributable to Solera Holdings, Inc. and net income (loss) attributable to Solera Holdings, Inc. per common share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 reflects one-time charges associated with the redemption of our 2018 Senior Notes in November 2013 of $60.2 million.

This guidance primarily requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015—14, _Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the effective date, which deferred the_ effective date of ASU Topic No. 2014-09 for one year. As a result, ASU Topic No. 2014-09 will be effective for our fiscal year 2019. ASU Topic No. 2014-09 permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the effect that ASU Topic No. 2014-09 will have on our financial condition, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an _Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to perform interim and_ annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity’s financial statements. ASU Topic No. 2014-15 is effective for our fiscal year 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015-3, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic _835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs_ related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU Topic No. 2015-3 is effective for our fiscal year 2017. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU Topic No. 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated _With Line-of-Credit Arrangements—Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting, which clarified the presentation and measurement requirements of_ debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit arrangements. ASU Topic No. 2015-15 allows an entity to either defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement, or present them as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt as provided by ASU Topic No. 2015-3.ASU Topic No. 2015-15 is effective for our fiscal year 2017. The adoption of these standards will result in reclassification of debt issuance costs from assets to liabilities. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015- 5, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal_Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing _Arrangement, which provides guidance to help entities determine whether a cloud computing_ arrangement includes a software license and evaluate fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement.

ASU Topic No. 2015-16 is effective for our fiscal year 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015—17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): _Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be_ classified as noncurrent assets or noncurrent liabilities. ASU Topic No. 2015-16 is effective for our fiscal year 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2016—1, Financial Statements—Overall _(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which_ requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income; use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk; and eliminates the requirement disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet.

Under the two-class method, basic and diluted net income (loss) per share is determined by calculating net income (loss) per share for common stock and participating securities based on the cash dividends paid and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Diluted net income per share also considers the dilutive effect of in-the-money stock options and unvested restricted stock units and performance share units that have the right to receive forfeitable dividends, calculated using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount of assumed proceeds from unexercised stock options and unvested restricted stock units and performance share units that have the right to forfeitable dividends includes the amount of compensation cost attributable to future services not yet recognized, proceeds from the exercise of the options, and any excess income tax benefit or liability.

We also consider the fair value using a market approach, which considers comparable companies and transactions, including transactions with the noncontrolling stockholders of our majority-owned subsidiaries. F-63 ----- Under the income approach, the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period. Both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows. A weighted average cost of capital of a market participant, which is an unobservable input, is used as the discount rate. The residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period. Alternatively, the present value of the residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period. Under the market approach, fair value is determined based on multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for each reporting unit. For our calculation, we determined the multiples based on a selection of comparable companies and acquisition transactions, discounted for each reporting unit to reflect the relative size, diversification and risk of the reporting unit in comparison to the indexed companies and transactions. Although we considered the fair value under both the income and market approaches, we estimated the fair value of our redeemable noncontrolling interests based solely upon the income approach, which utilizes a discounted cash flow model, a Level 3 input, as we believe this is the better indicator of fair value. The significant unobservable inputs in the discounted cash flow model include a discount rate and a long-term growth rate. The discount rate used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2015 using the income approach ranged between 12.8% and 16.4%, with a weighted average discount rate of 13.2%, reflecting a market participant’s perspective as a noncontrolling shareholder in a privately-held subsidiary. The long-term growth rate used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2015 using the income approach was 4.0%.

Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash._ Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, primarily consist of bank deposits, money market funds and bank certificates of deposit. The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are determined using quoted market prices for identical assets (Level 1 inputs). Derivative financial instruments._ We estimate the fair value of our derivative financial instruments using industry standard valuation techniques that utilize market-based observable inputs to extrapolate future reset rates from period-end yield curves and standard valuation models based on a discounted cash flow model. Market-based observable inputs including spot and forward rates, volatilities and interest rate curves at observable intervals are used as inputs to the models (Level 2 inputs). Our estimate of fair value also considers the credit related risk that the swap contracts will not be fulfilled. Accrued contingent purchase consideration._ Contingent future cash payments related to business combinations that are not deemed to be compensatory are accrued at fair value as of the acquisition date. We re-assess the fair value measurement at each reporting date. Fair value is determined by estimating the present value of potential future cash payments that would be earned upon achievement by the acquired business of certain financial performance, product-related, integration and other objectives. Our estimate of fair value considers a range of possible cash payment scenarios using information available as of the reporting date, including the recent financial performance of the acquired businesses (Level 3 inputs).

Derivative Financial Instruments,334.87.1,,"In the normal course of business, we are exposed to variability in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivatives to mitigate risks associated with this variability. We do not use derivatives for speculative purposes. The following is a summary of outstanding derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2015: ‰ In April 2012, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swaps in the aggregate notional amount of €109.0 million. We pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 6.990% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.750% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the swaps is June 15, 2018. These cross-currency swaps were designated, at inception, as cash flow hedges and we evaluate the swaps for effectiveness quarterly. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. To date, there has been no hedge ineffectiveness. ‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay floating / received fixed interest rate swap with a notional amount of $400.0 million. Under the terms of the interest rate swap, we pay quarterly floating coupon payments at 3-month LIBOR plus 3.924% and receive semi-annual fixed coupon payments at 6.000%. The maturity date of the interest rate swap is June 15, 2021, although the swap may be terminated at any time effective June 15, 2017 by the counterparty subject to the payment of a cancellation fee. The interest rate swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). ‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars crosscurrency swap with a notional amount of €401.6 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.993% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is June 15, 2021. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). ‰ In March 2015, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swap with a notional amount of €174.8 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.725% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is June 15, 2021. The cross-currency swap was designated as a net investment hedge at inception. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. In October 2015, we dedesignated the cross-currency swap as a net investment hedge. Upon de-designation, we recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). ‰ In March 2015, we entered into a foreign exchange forward contract with a notional amount of €472.9 million.

In July 2015, we partially settled the foreign exchange forward contract for a cash payment of $8.9 million which is reported in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Settlement of the remaining foreign exchange forward contract with a notional amount of €235.8 million was extended to July 2016. F-67 ----- ‰ In July 2015, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swaps, each with a notional amount of €137.0 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swaps, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.135% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swaps is November 1, 2018. One of the cross-currency swaps was designated as a net investment hedge at inception and one was not designated as a hedge at inception. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on the cross-currency swap designated as a net investment hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. In October 2015, we de-designated the cross-currency swap as a net investment hedge. Upon the de-designation, we recognize changes in the fair value of both swaps in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). ‰ In July 2015, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swap with a notional amount of €274.0 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.585% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is November 1, 2023. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swaps in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). We determined the estimated fair value of our derivatives using an income approach and standard valuation techniques that utilize market-based observable inputs including spot and forward interest and foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities and interest rate curves at observable intervals. Our estimate of fair value also considers the risk that the swap contracts will not be fulfilled.

Provision For Income Taxes,334.99.1,,"Our tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Our quarterly tax provision is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in law, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. We recorded an income tax provision (benefit) of $(21.9) million and $9.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2015, the expected tax provision derived from applying the U.S. federal statutory rate to our pre-tax income differed from our recorded income tax provision primarily due to the amount of our pre-tax loss, relative to our income tax expense, nondeductible expenses, and changes in tax law. Gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015 were $10.6 million and $10.3 million, respectively. No significant interest and penalties have been accrued during the six months ended December 31, 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the respective acquisition agreements, the sellers in our business combinations have indemnified us for all tax liabilities related to the pre-acquisition periods. We are liable for any tax assessments for the post-acquisition periods for our U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. As of each reporting date, management considers all evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact our view with regards to future realization of deferred tax assets including our U.S. cumulative income or loss position over the 12 quarters ended December 31, 2015 which included recent increases to interest expense. As of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets of $26.9 million due to the limitation in our ability to utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. The U.S. cumulative loss position reduced the weight given to subjective evidence such as projections for future growth. We believe that our estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently F-72 ----- uncertain, and if our current or future operations and investments generate taxable income different than the anticipated amounts or US tax law changes reduce income expected in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowance are possible. Primarily due to the increase in our U.S. debt service obligations resulting from the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million during fiscal year 2015 and the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $850.0 million in July 2015, management concluded that the ability to access certain amounts of foreign earnings would provide greater flexibility to meet domestic cash flow needs without constraining foreign objectives. Accordingly, in fiscal year 2015 we withdrew the permanent reinvestment assertion on $350.0 million of earnings generated by certain of our foreign subsidiaries through fiscal year 2015. We provided for U.S. income taxes on the $350.0 million of undistributed foreign earnings, resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax liability of approximately $123.7 million. During the six months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a deferred income tax expense of $2.9 million related to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchanges rates on the portion of the $350.0 million of unremitted earnings generated prior to fiscal year 2015.",N/A,as_expected,2016,364

Pending Acquisition by Affiliates of Vista Equity Partners,334.103.1,,"On September 13, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Summertime Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and Summertime Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent and Merger Sub were formed by affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Fund V, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Sponsor” or “Vista”). The board of directors of the Company (the “Board”), following the receipt of the unanimous recommendation of a special committee of independent directors of the Board, unanimously approved the Merger Agreement. On December 8, 2015, our stockholders voted to adopt the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than (i) shares owned by stockholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights, (ii) shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and (iii) shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, in each of cases (ii) and (iii) not held on behalf of third parties), will be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $55.85, without interest thereon. Consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified closing conditions, including (i) the approval of the Merger by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock entitled to vote at a stockholders meeting (which was approved on December 8, 2015), (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (which termination occurred on October 9, 2015) and the receipt of certain other non-United States regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger (which we have received effective as of December 31, 2015), and (iii) other customary closing conditions, including (a) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (b) the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties (subject to customary materiality qualifiers) and (c) each party’s performance of its obligations and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of the parties customary for a transaction of this type, including, among other things, covenants not to solicit alternative transactions or to provide information or enter into discussions in connection with alternative transactions, subject to certain exceptions to allow the Board to exercise its fiduciary duties. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Parent, including, among others, if the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are not consummated on or before March 15, 2016 or if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement in compliance with its terms in order to accept a superior proposal. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, the Company has agreed to pay Parent a termination fee of F-74 ----- $114.4 million and/or reimburse Parent’s expenses up to $5.0 million (which reimbursement shall reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis, any termination fee subsequently payable by the Company). Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain other specified circumstances, Parent will be required to pay the Company a termination fee equal to $228.75 million. The Sponsor has provided the Company with a limited guarantee in favor of the Company guaranteeing the payment of Parent’s termination fee if such amount becomes payable under the Merger Agreement. Parent has obtained common equity, preferred equity and debt financing commitments for the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the aggregate proceeds of which will be sufficient for Parent to pay the aggregate merger consideration and all related fees and expenses. Financing will consist of common equity committed by Parent and common equity, preferred equity and debt committed by third party financing sources. In connection with the pending Merger, the Company commenced cash tender offers for the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes (collectively, the “Notes”). Noteholders that validly tender their Notes by January 28, 2016 (the “Early Tender Date”) will receive an amount equal to $1,012.50 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes, which includes an early participation premium of $50.00 per $1,000.00 in principal amount. Noteholders that validly tender their Notes by January 29, 2016 (the “Expiration Date”) will receive an amount equal to $962.50 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes. Consummation of the tender offer and payment for the Notes validly tendered pursuant to the tender offer are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, but not limited to, the receipt of requisite consents, the consummation of the Merger and financing conditions. Concurrently with the commencement of the tender offer, the Company commenced the requisite change of control redemption offer for the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101.000% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the redemption date (“Change of Control Offer”). As of January 6, 2016, the Company has received tenders and consents from holders of $1,680.7 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes, representing approximately 99.7% of the total outstanding principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes, and tenders and consents from holders of $1,413.8 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes, representing approximately 99.9% of the total outstanding principal amount of the 2023 Notes. The Company has received the requisite consents in respect of the Notes to amend the respective indentures governing the Notes. As a result, the Company and the Trustee executed supplemental indentures relating to each of the 2021 Notes and the 2023 Notes on November 20, 2015 (“Supplemental Indentures”). Upon the effectiveness of the Supplemental Indentures, the Company will no longer have an obligation to make the Change of Control Offer. As a result, the Company terminated the Change of Control Offer. On September 21, 2015, an alleged stockholder of the Company filed an action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware on behalf of a putative class of the Company’s stockholders against the Company and its directors, Vista, Parent and Merger Sub. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the Company’s directors breached their fiduciary duties by approving the Merger Agreement at an inadequate price and following an inadequate sale process, and that the Company, Vista, Parent and Merger Sub aided and abetted these alleged breaches of duty. The complainant seeks, among other things, either to enjoin the proposed transaction or to rescind it should it be consummated, as well as an award of plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and costs in the action. On October 13, 2015, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. On October 21, 2015, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint that added allegations contending that the Company’s disclosure contained in the preliminary version the Company’s proxy statement misstated or failed to F-75 ----- disclose certain allegedly material information to Company stockholders. On October 22, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the holding of the Company’s shareholder meeting based upon his claim that the Company’s public disclosures were inadequate. On November 5, 2015, the Court denied the motion for expedited proceedings, and declined to consider plaintiff’s motion seeking to enjoin the special meeting. The defendants deny any wrongdoing in connection with the merger and plan to defend vigorously against the claims set forth in the amended complaint and any injunction motion. On November 17, 2015, a duplicative action was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against our directors on behalf of the same putative class of the Company’s stockholders, alleging similar claims for breach of fiduciary duty and challenging the merger and the disclosures relating to the merger. On December 23, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action. That motion remains pending.
