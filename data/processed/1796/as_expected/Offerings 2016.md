### $1,730,000,000

## Solera, LLC Solera Finance, Inc.
### 10.500% Senior Notes due 2024

Solera, LLC (the “Issuer”) and Solera Finance, Inc. (the “Co-Issuer” and, together with the Issuer, the “Issuers”) are offering
$1,730,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 10.500% senior notes due 2024 (the “notes”).

This offering is part of the financing for, and is conditioned upon, the proposed acquisition of Solera Holdings, Inc. by Summertime
Holding Corp. (“Parent”), an affiliate of Vista Equity Partners (“Vista”) and the indirect parent of Summertime Acquisition Corp. (“Merger
Sub”). At the time of the acquisition, Merger Sub will merge with and into Solera Holdings, Inc., with Solera Holdings, Inc. continuing as
the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuers. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with
certain equity investments and the proceeds from initial borrowings under our New Term Loan Facility (as defined herein), to finance the
Merger (as defined herein) and pay related fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions (as defined herein).

The notes will mature on March 1, 2024. We will pay interest on the notes semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of
each year, commencing on September 1, 2016. We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time prior to March 1, 2019 at a price equal
to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date,
plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in this offering circular. On or after March 1, 2019, we may redeem some or all of the notes at the
applicable redemption prices set forth in this offering circular, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption
date. We may also redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at any time prior to March 1, 2019 using the net cash
proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this offering circular, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
not including, the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a
change of control, we may be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.

The notes will rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment
to all of our future subordinated indebtedness. Following the consummation of the Merger, each of Solera’s existing and future
restricted subsidiaries will guarantee the notes on a senior unsecured basis to the extent such subsidiary guarantees our New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities (as defined herein) or certain syndicated bank debt and capital markets debt securities. Such note guarantees
will rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all future
subordinated indebtedness of such guarantors. The notes and the note guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of our existing
and future secured indebtedness, including indebtedness under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, to the extent of the value of
the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities
of any of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. To the extent lenders under our New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities release any guarantor from its obligations, such guarantor will also be released from its obligations under its note
guarantees. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

Currently there is no public market for the notes. The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation
system.

_Investing in the notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 34._

**Offering Price of Notes: 95.000%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from March 3, 2016**

**The notes and the note guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended**
**(the “Securities Act”), or the securities law of any other jurisdiction. The notes may not be offered or sold within the**
**United States or to U.S. persons, except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided**
**by Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in reliance on**
**Regulation S under the Securities Act. Prospective purchasers that are qualified institutional buyers are hereby notified that**
**sellers of the notes may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by**
**Rule 144A. The notes are not transferable except in accordance with the restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions.”**
**The notes and the note guarantees will not be entitled to any registration rights and the Issuers will not be required to complete**
**a registered exchange offer or shelf registration or prospectus with respect to the notes or the note guarantees.**

The initial purchasers expect to deliver to investors the notes only in book-entry form through the facilities of The Depository
Trust Company on or about March 3, 2016.

Our fiscal year ends on June 30 of each year. Fiscal years are identified in this offering circular
according to the calendar year in which they end. For example, the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 is
referred to as “fiscal year 2015.” Unless otherwise specified, all references in this offering circular to
years are to fiscal years.

The Issuers of the notes offered hereby will be Solera, LLC and Solera Finance, Inc., entities that
were formed in connection with the Transactions. Neither Solera, LLC nor Solera Finance, Inc. has any
assets or operations other than their indirect ownership of 100% of the capital stock of Merger Sub.
Because the assets and operations of the Issuers following the Merger will consist of their ownership of
Solera and its subsidiaries, the consolidated financial information included in this offering circular is
financial information of Solera and its consolidated subsidiaries. There are no audited financial
statements of the Issuers for any periods in this offering circular.

Unless otherwise stated herein, pro forma financial information gives effect to the Transactions,
as described under “Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Pro Forma Financial Information.” Numerical
figures included in this offering circular have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly,
numerical figures shown as totals in various tables may not be arithmetic aggregations of the figures
that precede them.

We have not included in this offering circular any separate financial statements for the guarantors
or a footnote to Solera’s consolidated financial statements showing condensed consolidating financial
information for Solera, the guarantors and our non-guarantor subsidiaries as would be required if we
were registering the notes with the SEC. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our nonguarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $622.5 million, or 51.9%, of our revenues, and
approximately $293.5 million, or 63.9%, of our Adjusted EBITDA. Excluding the effect of intercompany
balances as well as intercompany transactions, our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for
approximately $1,231.1 million, or 33.2%, of our total assets, and approximately $251.5 million, or
6.9%, of our total liabilities, in each case as of December 31, 2015. We have calculated the foregoing
amounts on an historic basis without giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, including the
application of purchase accounting, because we have not completed the required allocation of the
estimated purchase price to our net tangible and intangible assets held by each subsidiary. We do not
expect that this allocation will be completed until after the completion of the Transactions.

Unless the context otherwise requires, this offering circular assumes the Merger has been
consummated.

vi


-----

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

We believe that the financial statements included in this offering circular have been prepared in a
manner that complies, in all material respects, with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States (“GAAP”), and the regulations published by the SEC, and are consistent with current
practice with the exception of the presentation of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including
Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and net debt, the inclusion of financial data for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2015, including pro forma financial data, and the omission of certain financial
information regarding the guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries.

Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and net debt as presented in this offering circular are
supplemental measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. These are
not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an
alternative to revenues, net income, income before income tax provision, or any other performance
measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to total debt or cash flow from
operations or any other measure of our liquidity. These measures are not intended to be measures of
free cash flow available for management’s discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash
requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. In addition, our
method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow may vary from the method used by other
companies.

Our management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be a key indicator of our financial performance.
Additionally, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other
interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. We also believe that investors,
analysts and rating agencies consider Adjusted EBITDA a useful means of measuring our ability to
meet our debt service obligations and evaluating our financial performance, and management uses this
measurement for one or more of these purposes. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be
construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in
isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. The use of Adjusted
EBITDA instead of net income has limitations as an analytical tool, including the following:

‰ Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital
needs;

‰ Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to
service interest or principal payments, on our debt;

‰ Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;

‰ Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated
and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not
reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;

‰ Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for
capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and

‰ Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments that represented a cash expense or that represented a
non-cash charge that may relate to a future cash expense, and some of these expenses are of
a type that we expect to incur in the future, although we cannot predict the amount of any such
future charge.

Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a replacement for
net income or as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to service our indebtedness or invest
in our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and
using Adjusted EBITDA only for supplemental purposes.

vii


-----

In this offering circular, we also present pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2015, which further adjusts Adjusted EBITDA to also include adjustments for ongoing
waste elimination, compensation adjustments, annualized EBITDA of Recent Acquisitions, pro forma
margin impact from Recent Acquisitions and planned restructuring initiatives and public company cost
savings. See note (6) to “Summary—Summary Condensed Consolidated Historical and Pro Forma
Financial Data.”

Our management considers Free Cash Flow and net debt to be key indicators of our liquidity.
Additionally, we believe Free Cash Flow and net debt are frequently used by securities analysts,
investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. We also believe
that investors, analysts and rating agencies consider Free Cash Flow and net debt a useful means of
measuring our ability to meet our debt service obligations and evaluating our liquidity, and
management uses these measurements for one or more of these purposes. Our presentation of Free
Cash Flow and net debt should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be
unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Free Cash Flow and net debt have important limitations
as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our
results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, Free Cash Flow and net debt should not
be considered as a replacement for cash flow from operations or total debt or as a measure of our
liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Free
Cash Flow and net debt only for supplemental purposes.

For the definition of and additional information about our Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and
net debt, a description of how Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are calculated and a
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow to the most directly comparable GAAP
measures, including the presentation of such data on a pro forma basis, see “Summary—Summary
Condensed Consolidated Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data” and “Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Pro Forma Financial Information.”

**TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS**

We own or have rights to trademarks or trade names that we use in conjunction with the
operation of our business and that appear in this offering circular. This offering circular also contains
trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights of other companies that are the property of
their respective owners. Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to in this
offering circular may appear without the [®] or TM symbols, but such references are not intended to

**MARKET SHARE, RANKING AND SIMILAR INFORMATION**

The market share, ranking and other information contained in this offering circular is based on our
own estimates, independent industry publications, reports by market research firms, including
confidential third-party commissioned studies, or other published and unpublished independent
sources. In each case, we believe that they are reasonable estimates, although we have not
independently verified market and industry data provided by third parties. Market share information is
subject to changes, however, and cannot always be verified with complete certainty due to limits on the
availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data-gathering process and other
limitations and uncertainties inherent in any statistical survey of market share. In addition, customer
preferences can and do change and the definition of the relevant market is a matter of judgment and
analysis. As a result, you should be aware that market share, ranking and other similar information set
forth in this offering circular, and estimates and beliefs based on such data, may not be reliable.

costs, and provide repair cost estimates that rely on common data sources which in turn reduce these
costs and delays. Our databases provide insurance companies access to detailed information about
property damage, repair times and replacement costs, allowing insurance companies to more
accurately estimate fair settlement values and reduce overpayment on claims. In addition, having
access to our databases helps insurance companies generate more accurate repair estimates and
identify top-performing collision repair facilities.

**Competitive Strengths**

**_Leading Global Market Position._** We are a leading provider of risk and asset management
software and services to the automotive and property marketplace, including the global property and
casualty insurance industry. We have a presence in more than 75 countries across six continents and
a leading global business portfolio as detailed below:

Automobile Claims Processing - Number one global provider of automobile claims processing

                      - A global leader in glass claims

Property Claims - Emerging player in automated claims handling

Service, Maintenance and Repair • Number one U.S. provider of experienced-based repair solutions

Automobile Parts - A leading North American provider of electronic parts exchanges

Owner - U.S. leading provider of driver event monitoring

                      - U.K. leading provider of vehicle validation

CRM-SMR - Largest integrated CRM retention system in North America

Vehicle Valuation - U.K. industry standard for valuation data

                      - One of the leading providers of valuations to the U.S. insurance
industry

We believe that the large number of geographic regions in which we operate provides a strategic
advantage when expanding into new markets by enabling us to utilize our databases and vehicle
coverage already present in adjacent or nearby markets.

**_Proprietary Databases that are Difficult to Replicate._** We believe that our proprietary
databases pose barriers to entry due to the significant capital investment and time that would be
required to develop a similar set of integrated databases and customize them for use in local markets.
Our proprietary databases have been built over 45 years of developing, collecting, organizing and
managing automobile-related information and data. Over the last five years, we have invested over
$100 million annually, including $135 million in fiscal year 2015, to maintain and expand our proprietary
databases and related software applications, including customizing our databases for use in local
markets. Our databases cover more than 98% of the vehicles on the road today in our core markets
dating back to 1970. Our databases empower our clients to achieve measurably better outcomes,
through increased efficiency in the claims management and collision repair processes.

**_Strongly positioned to capitalize on market opportunities._** We are a global market leader in
the automotive insurance claim industry. We believe that our leadership in data, software and
networking across platforms and our loyal customer base will enable us to take advantage of our digital
content platform enhanced by favorable trends in our industry. The global automotive insurance
industry has focused on claims processing efficiency and reducing claims cost severity through
digitalization, as the number of claims processed each year is expected to increase to 165 million by
2020, from over 100 million currently. Additionally, more cars and an aging car parc will increase
demand for our SMR and CRM platforms as the global car parc is expected to increase to 1.5 billion
cars by year 2020 (from 1.2 billion currently) and as the average vehicle stays longer on the road
(average age of a vehicle in the United States has increased to 11.4 years in 2014, from 9.7 years in
2003). Our next generation Digital Content Applications will connect all of our platforms to disrupt and

proliferate the digital lifecycle experience of our customer’s customer as we take our core competency
from the auto to the home.

**_Long-term Relationships with a Large and Diverse Customer Base._** We serve over 195,000
customers in more than 75 countries across six continents. We derive revenues from many of the
world’s largest automobile insurance companies, including the ten largest automobile insurance
companies in Europe and eight of the ten largest automobile insurance companies in North America.
No single customer accounted for more than 3.0% and 2.9% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2015 and for the six months ended December 31, 2015, respectively.

**_High Visibility from Recurring Revenue Base._** A substantial portion of our revenues are
derived from customers who have used our software and services for many years. Our customer
retention is very high because of long-standing customer relationships and the integration of our claims
processing software and services into our customers’ systems. In addition, we have subscription-based
or transaction-based contracts with many of our customers. As a result, 97% of our revenues in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were recurring.

**_Strong and Steady Financial Performance._** We have grown our revenues and Adjusted
EBITDA consistently every year, at a revenue CAGR of 11.4% and an Adjusted EBITDA CAGR of
15.6% since fiscal 2006. We have attractive operating margins and moderate working capital
requirements that we believe drive strong free cash flow generation relative to other enterprise
software companies. We have expanded our Adjusted EBITDA margins from 28.9% in 2006 to 38.3%
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, reflecting, among other things, increased operating
leverage and cost saving initiatives while continuing our expansion in both Evolving Markets and
Emerging Markets. Moreover, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our Free Cash Flow
conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA) was 83.8%. See
note (9) to “—Summary Consolidated Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data” for the definition of
Free Cash Flow.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our RMS, SMR and CRM platform revenues
were 53%, 14% and 33%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the three months ended December
31, 2015, the three months ended September 30, 2015 and the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015,
2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, our organic growth rate on a constant currency basis was 6.3%, 7.3%,
6.4%, 4.4%, 3.8%, 4.9% and 5.6%, respectively, while our total growth rate (including acquisitions) on
a constant currency basis was 16.3%, 21.9%, 22.6%, 16.8%, 8.5%, 17.4% and 8.1% for those periods,
respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2015, the three months ended September 30,
2015 and the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, our Americas organic
growth rate on a constant currency basis was 7.0%, 10.3%, 6.9%, 4.4%, 4.9%, 5.2% and 5.2%,
respectively, and our EMEA organic growth rate on a constant currency basis was 5.5%, 4.1%,
6.0%, 4.4%, 3.0%, 4.7% and 5.9% for those periods, respectively. For the three months ended
December 31, 2015, the three months ended September 30, 2015 and the fiscal years ended June 30,
2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, our non-RMS organic growth rate on a constant currency basis was
8.6%, 10.8%, 11.0%, 4.8%, 3.6%, 5.5% and 10.5%, respectively, while our RMS organic growth rate
on a constant currency basis was 4.6%, 5.5%, 3.8%, 4.3%, 3.8%, 4.7% and 4.4% for those periods,
respectively. Our organic growth rate, EMEA organic growth rate and non-RMS organic growth rate for
the three months ended December 31, 2015 have been normalized to account for the one-time impact
of our acquisition of CAP Automotive, which closed in mid-November 2014. Our organic growth rate,
Americas organic growth rate and RMS organic growth rate for the three months ended September 30,
2015 have been normalized to account for the one-time impact of our acquisition of the Insurance and
Services Division of Pittsburgh Glass Works, LLC (“I&S”), which closed on July 29, 2014.

**The Transactions**

**Merger**

On September 13, 2015, Solera entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
Agreement”) with Parent and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge
with and into Solera, with Solera surviving the merger as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
(the “Merger”). Parent and Merger Sub are beneficially owned by VEPFV, and Parent, Merger Sub and
VEPFV are affiliated with Vista. At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of
Solera common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
such shares (x) that are owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent or owned by Solera or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Solera, in
each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (y) that are held by stockholders who have properly
exercised and perfected appraisal rights with respect to such shares) will be converted into the right to
receive an amount equal to $55.85 in cash (the “Acquisition Consideration”), without interest and less
any applicable withholding taxes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Merger—Holders of a
substantial number of shares of Solera common stock have purported to have delivered written
demands for the appraisal of their shares under Delaware law. If these appraisal demands are not
withdrawn or determined to be invalid, or do not otherwise cease under Delaware law, the claims
represented by such appraisal demands will constitute a substantial contingent liability of ours and will
also result in our incurring substantial interest charges until they are resolved.”

We expect to finance the Merger, the Refinancing (as defined below) and pay the fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions with proceeds from the Financing Transactions
described below. For a more complete description of the Transactions, see “The Transactions,” “Use of
Proceeds,” “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes.”

The Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by Solera’s
stockholders and receipt of certain approvals by antitrust and competition authorities of various
jurisdictions. On October 9, 2015, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
“HSR Act”), and on December 3, 2015, the European Commission approved the Merger under the EU
Merger Regulation. On December 8, 2015, Solera’s stockholders voted to adopt the Merger
Agreement. The closing of the Merger remains subject to certain other customary closing conditions.

Solera has made customary representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and has
agreed to customary covenants regarding the operation of the business of Solera and its subsidiaries
prior to the consummation of the Merger. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for
Parent and Solera, including the right of each party to terminate the Merger Agreement if, other than in
certain circumstances described therein, the Merger is not consummated by March 15, 2016. The
completion of the Merger is currently expected to occur concurrently with the consummation of this
offering.

**The Financing Transactions**

In connection with the consummation of the Merger, we anticipate entering into the following
financing transactions (the “Financing Transactions”):

‰ the contribution of common equity financing in an aggregate amount of up to $1.2 billion to be
provided to Parent by VEPFV, or other parties to whom it assigns a portion of its commitment;


15


-----

‰ the contribution of common and preferred equity financing in an aggregate amount of up to
$1.3 billion to be provided to Parent by KSISH Investments, LLC (“KSISH”), an indirect
subsidiary of Koch Industries, Inc., or other parties to whom KSISH assigns a portion of its
commitment or with whom Vista arranges for alternative equity financing to replace all or a
portion of KSISH’s commitment (all of the preferred equity financing provided to Parent will be
contributed to the Issuer as common equity);

‰ the contribution of preferred equity financing in an aggregate amount of up to $800.0 million to
be provided to Parent by Broad Street Principal Investments, L.L.C. (“BSPI”) and KSISH, or
other parties to whom they assign a portion of their respective commitments (all of the
preferred equity financing provided to Parent will be contributed to the Issuer as common
equity);

‰ the borrowing of approximately $2,200.0 million in the form of a senior secured term facility (the
“New Term Loan Facility”) to be provided by certain debt commitment parties, including a U.S.
dollar tranche and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of a euro
tranche;

‰ the entry into a $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “New Revolving
Facility” and, together with the New Term Loan Facility, the “New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities”), under which we do not anticipate having any outstanding borrowings upon the
consummation of the Merger; and

‰ the issuance of $1,730.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes offered hereby.

See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Series A Preferred Stock” and
“—Series B Preferred Stock” for a description of the terms of the preferred equity financing and see
“Description of Other Indebtedness—New Senior Secured Credit Facilities” for a description of the
terms of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

As of February 26, 2016, Solera has received purported demands for appraisal with respect to
approximately 7,149,364 shares of Solera common stock (representing approximately $399.3 million if
appraisal has been properly demanded with respect to all of the approximately 7,149,364 shares for
which appraisal demands have purported to have been delivered as of February 26, 2016). Based on
this number of shares, the amount of financing necessary to consummate the Merger at the closing is
expected to be reduced by approximately $278.0 million (the “Appraisal Demand Amount”). The
remainder, or approximately $121.3 million related to demands for appraisal, will be funded at the
closing of the Merger. Parent expects to permit VEPFV, KSISH and certain other co-investors in
Parent’s common stock (collectively, the “Common Equity Investors”), at their option, and on a pro rata
basis, to reduce the amount of the common equity contribution to be funded by each of them in cash in
connection with the closing in an aggregate amount up to the Appraisal Demand Amount, and the
common equity contribution and total stockholders’ equity will be reduced by the aggregate amount
that is not funded. To the extent cash is needed in the future to pay for the shares of Solera common
stock with respect to which appraisal rights have been exercised, the Common Equity Investors will
remain committed to fund up to the Appraisal Demand Amount (or such lesser amount not funded in
connection with the closing of the Merger) pursuant to contractual arrangements with Parent.

**The Tender Offers, Consent Solicitations and the Change of Control Offers**

On November 6, 2015, Audatex North America, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Solera (“Audatex”), commenced cash tender offers (the “Tender Offers”) for any and all of its 6.000%
senior notes due 2021 (the “2021 Senior Notes”) and its 6.125% senior notes due 2023 (the “2023
Senior Notes” and, together with the 2021 Senior Notes, the “Existing Notes”). In conjunction with the


16


-----

Tender Offers, Audatex solicited consents (the “Consent Solicitations”) to amend certain provisions of
the indentures relating to the Existing Notes, including, but not limited to, amendments to eliminate or
modify substantially all of the restrictive covenants (including provisions relating to change of control
offers and limitations on secured indebtedness), certain requirements that must be satisfied in order for
Audatex to legally defease and discharge the Existing Notes, certain conditions governing the
revocation and effect of consents, certain reporting obligations, certain events of default and related
provisions (the “Proposed Amendments”). In order to adopt the Proposed Amendments, Audatex had
to receive validly tendered consents from holders of each series of the Existing Notes representing at
least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of such series of the Existing Notes then
outstanding, excluding consents from Audatex or any of its affiliates (the “Requisite Consents”). In
order for the Proposed Amendments to become operative, Audatex must pay for validly tendered
Existing Notes. Concurrently on November 6, 2015, Audatex commenced change of control offers (the
“Change of Control Offers”) for the Existing Notes.

As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 20, 2015, the initial early tender date for the
Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitations, $1,673,156,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2021
Senior Notes, representing 99.3% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior
Notes, were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, and $1,386,433,000 aggregate principal
amount of the 2023 Senior Notes, representing 98.0% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount
of the 2023 Senior Notes, were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn. On November 23, 2015,
Audatex extended the early tender date to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 6, 2016 and
extended the expiration date to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 13, 2016, unless further
extended or earlier terminated. As a result of receiving the Requisite Consents and adopting the
Proposed Amendments, the Change of Control Offers were terminated on November 23, 2015. The
Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitations are contingent upon, among other things, the
simultaneous closing of the Merger.

On December 7, 2015, Audatex reopened withdrawal rights on a limited basis with respect to the
Existing Notes that had been validly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offers until 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on December 18, 2015 (the “Withdrawal Deadline”). The withdrawal rights were limited to
only permit the withdrawal of previously tendered notes if and to the extent that at least a majority in
principal amount of each series of the outstanding Existing Notes remain tendered pursuant to the
Tender Offers as of the Withdrawal Deadline. Holders were not permitted to withdraw their consents
tendered in connection with the Consent Solicitations. The deadline for tendering the Existing Notes to
be eligible for the early participation premium was 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 24,
2016. On February 29, 2016, Audatex further extended the expiration date to 8:00 a.m., New York City
time, on March 3, 2016, unless further extended or earlier terminated. As of 8:00 a.m., New York City
time, on February 29, 2016, $1,684,373,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes,
representing 99.96% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes, were
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, and $1,414,500,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2023
Senior Notes, representing 99.96% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Senior
Notes, were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn.

This offering circular is not an offer to purchase, or the solicitation of an offer to sell, the Existing
Notes. The Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations are made only by and pursuant to the terms of the
Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement dated November 6, 2015 and the related letter of
transmittal and consent, in each case as amended or supplemented.

The Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitations are collectively referred to herein as the
“Refinancing,” and the Merger, the Financing Transactions and the Refinancing are collectively
referred to herein as the “Transactions.”

As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of $470.5 million in cash and cash equivalents without giving
effect to the Transactions. We expect that at the time of the closing of the Transactions (prior to giving effect
to the Transactions), our cash and cash equivalents will be approximately $480.0 million and that
approximately $391.0 million of the cash and cash equivalents balance at closing will be used to fund the
Transactions, with $210.3 million (includes $121.3 million relating to demands for appraisal that will be funded
at closing) of the remainder available as cash for working capital to fund operations. To the extent that our
cash and cash equivalents balance at the time of the closing of the Transactions is greater than
$480.0 million, such additional cash and cash equivalents will be used to fund the Transactions, and the cash
equity contribution described in footnote (5) above will be reduced by the difference between the cash
balance at closing used to fund the Transactions and $480.0 million. To the extent that our cash and cash
equivalents balance at the time of the closing of the Transactions is less than $480.0 million, the cash equity
contribution described in footnote (5) above will be increased by the difference between the cash balance at
closing used to fund the Transactions and $480.0 million. The statements in this footnote regarding our
expected cash and cash equivalents balance at the closing of the Transactions do not include any impact due
to our outstanding foreign currency exchange derivative financial instruments, including any impact
attributable to any termination thereof, which amounts could be material.
(7) As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2021 Senior
Notes and $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2023 Senior Notes. This amount
assumes all of the Existing Notes are tendered in connection with the Tender Offers and excludes any
accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any unamortized net premium. As of February 29, 2016, 99.96% of
the 2021 Senior Notes and 99.96% of the 2023 Senior Notes have been tendered. The 2021 Senior Notes
bear interest at 6.000% per annum and are scheduled to mature on June 15, 2021, and the 2023 Senior
Notes bear interest at 6.125% per annum and are scheduled to mature on November 1, 2023. See “The
Transactions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Pre-Transactions.”
(8) Reflects our estimate of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including early tender
participation premiums and accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes, original issue discount,
placement fees, initial purchaser discounts, underwriting and other financing fees, advisory fees and other
transaction costs and professional fees. The amount included on account of accrued and unpaid interest on
the Existing Notes is through December 31, 2015. We estimate the additional accrued interest on the Existing
Notes through the expected closing date will be approximately $32.8 million. To the extent any financing fees,
accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes, original issue discount and other fees and expenses
exceed the estimated amounts, we expect to fund such amounts with cash on our balance sheet at the
closing of the Transactions.

total liabilities, in each case as of December 31, 2015.

and future restricted subsidiaries to the extent such subsidiary
guarantees the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or certain
syndicated bank debt and capital markets debt securities.

The note guarantees of any guarantor will be released in the
event such guarantor’s guarantee under the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities is released. See “Description of
Notes—Guarantees.”

Ranking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes and the note guarantees will be the Issuer’s and the
guarantors’ senior unsecured obligations and will:

                   - rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated
indebtedness of the Issuers and the guarantors;

                     - rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future
senior indebtedness of the Issuers and the guarantors,
including obligations under any remaining Existing Notes

                    - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured

and future indebtedness and other claims and liabilities
(including trade payables) of any non-guarantor subsidiaries

22


-----

As of December 31, 2015, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom as
described under “Use of Proceeds,” (1) the notes and the note
guarantees would have ranked effectively junior to approximately
$2,200.0 million of secured indebtedness consisting of
borrowings under our New Term Loan Facility and (2) we would
have had additional unused availability under our New
Revolving Facility of $300.0 million. We also can incur
additional secured indebtedness if certain specified conditions
are met under the credit agreements that will govern the New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture that will
govern the notes offered hereby.

As of December 31, 2015, our non-guarantor subsidiaries
would not have had any indebtedness (excluding intercompany
liabilities).

Our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately
$622.5 million, or 51.9%, of our revenues, and approximately
$293.5 million, or 63.9%, of our Adjusted EBITDA, in each case
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the
effect of intercompany balances as well as intercompany
transactions, our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for
approximately $1,231.1 million, or 33.2%, of our total assets,
and approximately $251.5 million, or 6.9%, of our total
liabilities, in each case as of December 31, 2015.

Optional Redemption. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time prior to
March 1, 2019 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a “makewhole premium,” as described under “Description of Notes—
Optional Redemption.” At any time on or after March 1, 2019,
we may redeem some or all of the notes at the applicable
redemption prices described under “Description of Notes—
Optional Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to, but not including, the redemption date.

Additionally, from time to time prior to March 1, 2019, we may
redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the
notes at a redemption price equal to 110.500% of the principal
amount thereof, plus (i) an amount equal to or less than the net
cash proceeds that we raise in one or more equity offerings, plus
(ii) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the
redemption date.

For more information, see “Description of Notes—Optional
Redemption.”


23


-----

Tax Redemption. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We may redeem the notes in whole, but not in part, at any time
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the redemption date in certain circumstances in
which the Issuers or guarantors would become obligated to pay
additional amounts. See “Description of Notes—Redemption of
Notes for Tax Reasons.”

Payment of Additional Amounts . . . . . In the event that withholding taxes are required to be withheld
or deducted from payments on the notes or a guarantee thereof
after the occurrence of a European Domicile Transaction (as
defined in “Description of Notes—Merger, Consolidation,
Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”), the
Issuers or the guarantors will, subject to certain exceptions, pay
such additional amounts as will result, after deduction or
withholding of such taxes, in the payment of the amounts which
would have been payable in respect of such notes or the
guarantees thereof had no such withholding or deduction been
required. See “Description of Notes—Payment of Additional
Amounts on the Notes.”

Original Issue Discount. . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will be treated as issued with original issue discount
(“OID”) for United States federal income tax purposes in an
amount equal to the difference between their stated principal
amount and their issue price. As a result, a holder subject to
United States federal income taxation will be required to include
the OID in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (on
a constant yield to maturity basis), in advance of the receipt of
the corresponding cash payments, regardless of such holder’s
regular method of accounting for United States federal income
tax purposes. See “Certain United States Federal Tax
Considerations.”

Change of Control Offer . . . . . . . . . . . . Upon the occurrence of certain kinds of changes of control, you
will have the right, as holders of the notes, to require us to
repurchase some or all of your notes at a price equal to 101%
of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but not including, the repurchase date. See
“Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
Change of Control.”

We may not be able to pay you the required price for notes you
present to us at the time of a change of control, because:

                   - we may not have enough funds at that time; or

                 - the terms of our indebtedness under our New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities may prevent us from making such
payment.


24


-----

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the
Notes—We may not be able to purchase the notes upon a
change of control, which would result in a default under the
indenture that will govern the notes and would materially
adversely affect our business and financial condition.”

Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The indenture that will govern the notes will contain covenants
that, among other things, will limit the Issuers’ ability and the
ability of the Issuers’ restricted subsidiaries to:

                     - incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;

                     - incur liens or use assets as security in other transactions;

                    - make certain distributions, investments and other restricted
payments;

                     - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and

                   - merge or consolidate or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.

These covenants are subject to important exceptions and
qualifications as described under “Description of Notes—
Certain Covenants.” Many of these covenants will cease to
apply to each series of notes during any time that the notes of
each series have investment grade ratings from both Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s
Financial Services LLC (“S&P”) and no default has occurred
and is continuing under the indenture that will govern the notes.
See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.”

Transfer Restrictions; No
Registration Rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes and the note guarantees have not been registered
under the Securities Act or any state or other securities laws,
and we are under no obligation to so register the notes. The
notes are subject to restrictions on transfer and may not be
offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, except that holders will not be permitted to
transfer the notes in reliance on Rule 144 even after the
applicable holding period has been satisfied. See “Transfer
Restrictions.” We do not intend to issue registered notes and
note guarantees in exchange for the notes and the note
guarantees to be placed in this offering, and the absence of
registration rights may adversely impact the transferability of
the notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our
Indebtedness and the Notes—Holders of the notes will not be
entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to
register the notes under applicable securities laws. There are
restrictions on your ability to transfer and resell the notes
without registration under applicable securities laws.”


25


-----

No Prior Market; Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
market. Although the initial purchasers have informed us that
they intend to make a market in the notes, they are not
obligated to do so, and they may discontinue market making
activities at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you that a liquid market for the notes will develop or, if
such a market develops, that it will be maintained. The notes
will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated
quotation system.

Use of Proceeds. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We intend to use the net proceeds from the notes offered
hereby, together with the certain equity investments and the
proceeds from initial borrowings under the New Term Loan
Facility, to finance the Merger and pay related fees and
expenses in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of
Proceeds.”

Risk Factors. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Investing in the notes involves risks. You should consider
carefully the information set forth in “Risk Factors” and all other
information contained in this offering circular before deciding to
invest in the notes.

**Summary Condensed Consolidated Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data**

The following table sets forth our summary condensed consolidated historical and pro forma
financial data as of and for the periods indicated. We have derived the summary condensed
consolidated historical financial data as of June 30, 2013, 2014 and 2015 and for the fiscal years then
ended from our audited consolidated financial statements for such years. We have derived the
summary condensed consolidated historical financial data as of December 31, 2014 and 2015 and for
the six-month periods then ended from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for
such periods, which contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, that
management considers necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of
operations for the periods presented. Operating results for the six-month periods are not necessarily
indicative of results for a full fiscal year, or any other periods. Our audited consolidated financial
statements as of June 30, 2014 and 2015 and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2014 and
2015 and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and
for the six-month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 are included elsewhere in this offering
circular and do not reflect the impact of the Transactions.

The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) data for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2015 have been derived by adding the unaudited condensed
consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) data for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and the
unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) data for the six months ended
December 31, 2015 and subtracting the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of
income (loss) data for the six months ended December 31, 2014. The unaudited condensed
consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) data give pro forma effect to the consummation of
the Transactions as if they had occurred on July 1, 2014 and the unaudited condensed consolidated
pro forma balance sheet data give effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on December 31,
2015. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that
we believe are reasonable. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial data is
presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent our financial condition or
our results of operations had the Transactions occurred on or as of the dates noted above or to project
the results for any future date or period.

The Merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The pro forma
adjustments reflect adjustments required under GAAP for business combinations and are based upon,
among other things, preliminary estimates of fair market values of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Revisions to the preliminary
estimates of fair market value may have a significant impact on the pro forma amounts of total assets,
total liabilities and stockholders’ equity, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and
income tax expense.

matures on June 15, 2021 pursuant to which we pay quarterly floating coupon payments at 3-month LIBOR plus 3.924%
and receive semi-annual fixed coupon payments at 6.000%. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we
recognized unrealized gains on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments of $40.5 million, which is included in
other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). For additional information regarding our
outstanding derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2015, see Note 10, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended December 31, 2015, included elsewhere in
this offering circular.
(12) The ratio of pro forma net debt to pro forma Adjusted EBITDA is determined by dividing the total debt as of December 31,
2015 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions (but without reduction for the expected original issue
discount for the New Term Loan Facility, the original issue discount for the Notes offered hereby, or debt issuance costs to
be paid to creditors in connection with the Transactions), net of cash and cash equivalents, by pro forma Adjusted EBITDA
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. We define net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, as total debt less
cash and cash equivalents as of a particular date. Unaudited as adjusted net debt on a pro forma basis as of December 31,
2015 of $3,818 million gives effect to the Transactions as if such transactions were completed on that date (assuming
$112.3 million of cash on the balance sheet on a pro forma basis). See “Capitalization.”
(13) The pro forma cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 does not include $121.3 million relating to demands for
approval that will be funded at closing, the additional $9.5 million of cash and cash equivalents that we expect to have on
hand at the time of the closing of the Transactions or the additional $32.8 million that will need to be paid for accrued interest
on the Existing Notes.
(14) We define working capital as current assets less current liabilities.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Investing in the notes involves risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below,_
_as well as the other information included in this offering circular, before deciding to purchase any_
_notes. The risks described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties_
_not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also impair our business_
_operations. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,_
_results of operations and cash flows. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your investment in the_
_notes._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_We depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues, and_**
**_the loss of, or a significant reduction in volume from, any of these customers would harm our_**
**_financial results._**

We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to large insurance companies and
collision repair facilities that have relationships with these insurance companies. During fiscal year
2015 and the six months ended December 31, 2015, we derived 15.3% and 14.7% of our revenues,
respectively, from our ten largest insurance company customers. The largest three of these customers
accounted for 3.0%, 2.3% and 1.9%, respectively, of our revenues during fiscal year 2015 and 2.9%,
2.6% and 2.3%, respectively, of our revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2015. A loss of
one or more of these customers would result in a significant decrease in our revenues, including the
business generated by collision repair facilities associated with those customers. Furthermore, many of
our arrangements with European customers are terminable by them on short notice or at any time. In
addition, disputes with customers may lead to delays in payments to us, terminations of agreements or
litigation. Additional terminations or non-renewals of customer contracts or reductions in business from
our large customers would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our industry is highly competitive, and our failure to compete effectively could result in a_**
**_loss of customers and market share, which could harm our revenues and operating results._**

The markets for our automobile insurance claims processing software and services are highly
competitive. In the United States, our principal competitors are CCC Information Services Group Inc.
and Mitchell International Inc. In Europe, our principal competitors are EurotaxGlass’s Group, DAT
GmbH and GT Motive Einsa Group. Mitchell International recently consummated a strategic
relationship with GT Motive Einsa Group, including an equity investment. We also encounter regional
or country-specific competition in the markets for automobile insurance claims processing software and
services and our other products and services. For example Experian[®] is our principal competitor in the
United Kingdom in the vehicle validation market, car.tv is our principal competitor in Germany in the
online salvage vehicle disposition market and ChoicePoint is our principal competitor in the United
States in the automobile reunderwriting solutions market. The principal competitors of SRS in the U.S.
service, repair and maintenance software and solutions market are ALLDATA and the Mitchell repair
manuals. The principal competitor of our I&S business is Safelite Solutions and the principal
competitors to CAP are Kee Resources and Glass’s Guide. If one or more of our competitors develop
software or services that are superior to ours or are more effective in marketing their software or
services, our market share could decrease, thereby reducing our revenues. In addition, if one or more
of our competitors retain existing or attract new customers for which we have developed new software
or services, we may not realize expected revenues from these new offerings, thereby reducing our
profitability.

Some of our current or future competitors may have or develop closer customer relationships,
develop stronger brands, have greater access to capital, lower cost structures and/or more attractive

system design and operational capabilities than we have. Consolidation within our industry could result
in the formation of competitors with substantially greater financial, management or marketing resources
than we have, and such competitors could utilize their substantially greater resources and economies
of scale in a manner that affects our ability to compete in the relevant market or markets. As a result of
consolidation, our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer
needs, devote greater resources to promoting or selling their products and services, initiate and
withstand substantial price competition, expand into new markets, hire away our key employees,
change or limit access to key information and systems, take advantage of acquisition or other strategic
opportunities more readily and develop and expand their product and service offerings (including those
products and services that may compete with our risk and asset management platform and our “digital
garage” product) more quickly than we can. In addition, our competitors may form strategic or
exclusive relationships with each other, such as the equity interest in GT Motive Einsa Group
purchased by Mitchell International, and with other companies in attempts to compete more
successfully against us. These relationships may increase our competitors’ ability, relative to ours, to
address customer needs with their software and service offerings, which may enable them to rapidly
increase their market share.

Moreover, many insurance companies have historically entered into agreements with automobile
insurance claims processing service providers like us and our competitors whereby the insurance
company agrees to use that provider on an exclusive or preferred basis for particular products and
services and agrees to require collision repair facilities, independent assessors and other vendors to
use that provider. If our competitors are more successful than we are at negotiating these exclusive or
preferential arrangements, we may lose market share even in markets where we retain other
competitive advantages.

In addition, our insurance company customers have varying degrees of in-house development
capabilities, and one or more of them have expanded and may seek to further expand their capabilities
in the areas in which we operate. Many of our customers are larger and have greater financial and
other resources than we do and could commit significant resources to product development. Our
software and services have been, and may in the future be, replicated by our insurance company
customers in-house, which could result in our loss of those customers and their associated repair
facilities, independent assessors and other vendors, resulting in decreased revenues and net income.

**_The time and expense associated with switching from our competitors’ software and services_**
**_to ours may limit our growth._**

The costs for an insurance company to switch providers of claims processing software and
services can be significant and the process can sometimes take 12 to 18 months to complete. As a
result, potential customers may decide that it is not worth the time and expense to begin using our
software and services, even if we offer competitive and economic advantages. If we are unable to
convince these customers to switch to our software and services, our ability to increase market share
will be limited and could harm our revenues and operating results.

**_Our operating results may be subject to volatility as a result of exposure to foreign currency_**
**_exchange risks._**

We derive most of our revenues, and incur most of our costs, in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar, mainly the Euro. In our historical financial statements, we translate our local currency financial
results into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period for our
consolidated statement of income and certain components of stockholders’ equity or the exchange rate
at the end of that period for the consolidated balance sheet. These translations resulted in a net foreign
currency translation adjustment of $(167.7) million and $39.1 million for fiscal years 2015 and 2014,

respectively, and $24.1 million and $99.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2015 and
2014, respectively, which are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) in the stockholders’ equity. Ongoing global economic conditions have impacted currency
exchange rates.

Exchange rates between most of the major foreign currencies we use to transact our business
and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and we expect that they will
continue to fluctuate. The majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in Euros,
Pound Sterling, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars and other foreign currencies. The following table
provides the average quarterly exchange rates for the Euro and Pound Sterling since the beginning of
fiscal year 2015:

During fiscal year 2015, as compared to fiscal year 2014, the U.S. dollar strengthened against
most major foreign currencies we use to transact our business. Relative to the Euro and the
Pound Sterling, the average U.S. dollar strengthened versus the Euro by 11.4% and the
Pound Sterling by 3.2%, which decreased our revenues and expenses during fiscal year 2015. A
hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in the U.S. dollar versus other currencies in which we transact
our business would have resulted in an increase or decrease, as the case may be, to our revenues of
$31.7 million during fiscal year 2015.

During the six months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the six months ended
December 31, 2014, the U.S. dollar strengthened against most major foreign currencies we use to
transact our business. The average U.S. dollar strengthened versus the Euro by 14.3% and the
Pound Sterling by 5.7%, which decreased our revenues and expenses for the six months ended
December 31, 2015. A hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in the U.S. dollar versus other currencies
in which we transact our business would have resulted in an increase or decrease, as the case may
be, to our revenues of $15.5 million during the six months ended December 31, 2015.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to variability in foreign currency exchange
rates. We use derivatives to mitigate risks associated with this variability. The following is a summary
of outstanding derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2015 that are relevant to our
exposure to foreign currency risk:

‰ In April 2012, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency
swaps in the aggregate notional amount of €109.0 million. We pay Euro fixed coupon
payments at 6.990% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.750% on the notional
amount. The maturity date of the swaps is June 15, 2018. These cross-currency swaps were
designated, at inception, as cash flow hedges and we evaluate the swaps for effectiveness
quarterly. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these
gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. To date, there has
been no hedge ineffectiveness.

36


-----

‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay floating / received fixed interest rate swap with a
notional amount of $400.0 million. Under the terms of the interest rate swap, we pay quarterly
floating coupon payments at 3-month LIBOR plus 3.924% and receive semi-annual fixed
coupon payments at 6.000%. The maturity date of the interest rate swap is June 15, 2021,
although the swap may be terminated at any time effective June 15, 2017 by the counterparty
subject to the payment of a cancellation fee. The interest rate swap was not designated as a
hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap in other
(income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars crosscurrency swap with a notional amount of €401.6 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency
swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.993% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon
payments at 6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is
June 15, 2021. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We
recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net
in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

‰ In March 2015, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency
swap with a notional amount of €174.8 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we
pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.725% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at
6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is June 15,
2021. The cross-currency swap was designated as a net investment hedge at inception. We
report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these gains or losses
into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. On October 1, 2015, we dedesignated this cross-currency swap as a net investment hedge. Upon de-designation, we
recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net
in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

‰ In March 2015, we entered into a foreign exchange forward contract with a notional amount of
€472.9 million. Under the terms of the forward contract, we pay predetermined forward rate on
the settlement date. The foreign exchange forward contract was not designated as a hedge at
inception. We recognize changes in the fair value in other (income) expense, net in our
consolidated statements of income (loss). In July 2015, we partially settled the foreign
exchange forward contract for a cash payment of $8.9 million which is reported in other
(income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Settlement of the
remaining foreign exchange forward contract with a notional amount of €235.8 million was
extended to July 2016.

‰ In July 2015, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency
swaps, each with a notional amount of €137.0 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency
swaps, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.135% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon
payments at 6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swaps is
November 1, 2018. One of the cross-currency swaps was designated as a net investment
hedge at inception and one was not designated as a hedge at inception. We report the effective
portion of the gain or loss on the cross-currency swap designated as a net investment hedge
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and
reclassify these gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. On
October 1, 2015, we de-designated this cross currency swap as a net investment hedge. Upon
de-designation, we recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swaps in other
(income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

‰ In July 2015, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swap
with a notional amount of €274.0 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we pay
Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.585% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at

6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is November 1,
2023. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize
changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net in our
consolidated statements of income (loss).

Further fluctuations in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar could decrease our revenues and
associated profits and, therefore, harm our future operating results.

**_Current uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict_**
**_product demand, utilization and other related matters and makes it more likely that our actual_**
**_results could differ materially from expectations._**

Our operations and performance depend on worldwide economic conditions, which have
deteriorated significantly in many countries where our products and services are sold, and may remain
depressed for the foreseeable future. These conditions make it difficult for our customers and potential
customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and could cause our customers
and potential customers to slow, reduce or refrain from spending on our products. In addition, external
factors that affect our business have been and may continue to be impacted by the global economic
slowdown. Examples include:

‰ Number of Insurance Claims Made: In fiscal year 2015, the number of insurance claims
made increased slightly versus fiscal year 2014. However, in several of our large western
European markets, the number of insurance claims for vehicle damage submitted by owners to
their insurance carriers declined slightly. The number of insurance claims made can be
influenced by factors such as unemployment levels, the number of miles driven, rising gasoline
prices, the number of uninsured drivers, rising insurance premiums and insured drivers opting
for lower coverage or higher deductible levels, among other things. Fewer claims made can
reduce the transaction-based fees that we generate.

‰ Sales of New and Used Vehicles: According to industry sources, global new vehicle sales
grew by 3.6% in 2014 to 86.3 million units and sales are forecasted to reach 88.4 million units,
up by 2.4%, in 2015. In Advanced Markets, sales are projected to grow at a 0.7% CAGR from
2014 through 2024. In other markets, sales are projected to grow at a 6.6% CAGR from 2014
through 2024. Fewer new light vehicle sales can result in fewer insured vehicles on the road
and fewer automobile accidents, which can reduce the transaction-based fees that we
generate.

‰ Used Vehicle Retail and Wholesale Values: Declines in retail and wholesale used vehicle
values can impact vehicle owner and insurance carrier decisions about which damaged
vehicles should be repaired and which should be declared a total loss. The lower the retail and
wholesale used vehicle values, the more likely it is that a greater percentage of automobiles
are declared a total loss versus a partial loss. The fewer number of vehicles that owners and
insurance carriers decide to repair can reduce the transaction-based fees that we generate for
partial-loss estimates, but may have a beneficial impact on the transaction-based fees that we
generate for total-loss estimates.

‰ Automobile Usage-Number of Miles Driven: Several factors can influence miles driven,
including gasoline prices and economic conditions. According to industry sources, for calendar
year 2014, cumulative miles driven in the United States increased by 2.6% compared to the
same period in the prior year. For calendar year 2013, cumulative miles driven in the United
States remained flat compared to the same period in the prior year. Fewer miles driven can
result in fewer automobile accidents, which can reduce the transaction-based fees that we
generate.

Many of our markets around the world continue to experience or have recently experienced
volatility. Accordingly, we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or

38

subsequent economic recovery, worldwide or in particular economic markets. These and other
economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for or utilization of our products and
on our financial condition and operating results.

**_We may engage in acquisitions, joint ventures, dispositions or similar transactions that could_**
**_disrupt our operations, cause us to incur substantial expenses, result in dilution to our_**
**_stockholders and harm our business or results of operations._**

Our growth is dependent upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products
and introduce new products on a timely basis. We have addressed and will continue to address the
need to introduce new products both through internal development and through acquisitions of other
companies and technologies that would complement or extend our business or enhance our
technological capability. In fiscal year 2015, we acquired six businesses, including I&S and CAP, and
substantially all of the assets of another business. In fiscal year 2016 to date, we acquired one
business, and substantially all of the assets of another business and the remaining 50% equity
ownership interest in SRS.

Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend, to a varying extent,
on our ability to continue to expand the acquired business’ products and services and integrate them
with our products and services. Our management will be required to devote significant attention and
resources to these efforts, which may disrupt our core business, the acquired business or both and, if
executed ineffectively, could preclude realization of the full benefits we expect. Failure to realize the
anticipated benefits of our acquisitions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the
operations of the acquired business. In addition, the efforts required to realize the benefits of our
acquisitions may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses,
loss of customer relationships, and the diversion of management’s attention, and may cause our stock
price to decline. The risks associated with our acquisitions and future acquisitions include:

‰ adverse effects on existing customer or supplier relationships, such as cancellation of orders or
the loss of key customers or suppliers;

‰ difficulties in integrating or retaining key employees of the acquired company;

‰ difficulties in integrating the operations of the acquired company, such as information
technology resources, and financial and operational data;

‰ entering geographic or product markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;

‰ difficulties in assimilating product lines or integrating technologies of the acquired company into
our products;

‰ disruptions to our operations;

‰ diversion of our management’s attention;

‰ potential incompatibility of business cultures;

‰ potential dilution to existing stockholders if we issue shares of common stock or other securities
as consideration in an acquisition or if we issue any such securities to finance acquisitions;

‰ prohibitions against completing acquisitions as a result of regulatory restrictions or disruptions
in connection with regulatory investigations of completed acquisitions;

‰ limitations on the use of net operating losses or tax benefits;

‰ negative market perception, which could negatively affect our stock price;

‰ the assumption of debt and other liabilities, both known and unknown; and

‰ additional expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets or impairment
charges related to purchased intangibles and goodwill, or write-offs, if any, recorded as a result
of the acquisition.

39


-----

Many of these factors will be outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased
costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy.

Our merger and acquisition activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could
impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions. If we were found to violate antitrust and competition
laws, we would be subject to various remedies, including divestiture of the acquired businesses.

We participate in joint ventures in some countries and may participate in future joint ventures. Our
partners in these ventures may have interests and goals that are inconsistent with or different from
ours, which could result in the joint venture taking actions that negatively impact our growth in the local
market and consequently harm our business or financial condition. If we are unable to find suitable
partners or if suitable partners are unwilling to enter into joint ventures with us, our growth into new
geographic markets may slow, which would harm our results of operations.

Additionally, we may finance future acquisitions, and/or additional joint ventures with cash from
operations, additional indebtedness and/or the issuance of additional securities, any of which may
impair the operation of our business or present additional risks, such as reduced liquidity, or increased
interest expense. We may also seek to restructure our business in the future by disposing of certain of
our assets, which may harm our future operating results, divert significant managerial attention from
our operations and/or require us to accept non-cash consideration, the market value of which may
fluctuate.

Failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired
businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Our operating results may vary widely from period to period due to the sales cycle, seasonal_**
**_fluctuations and other factors._**

Our contracts with insurance companies generally require time-consuming authorization
procedures by the customer, which can result in additional delays between when we incur
development costs and when we begin generating revenues from those software or service offerings.
In addition, we incur significant operating expenses while we are researching and designing new
software and related services, and we typically do not receive corresponding payments in those same
periods. As a result, the number of new software and service offerings that we are able to implement,
successfully or otherwise, can cause significant variations in our cash flow from operations, and we
may experience a decrease in our net income as we incur the expenses necessary to develop and
design new software and services. Accordingly, our quarterly and annual revenues and operating
results may fluctuate significantly from period to period.

Our business is subject to seasonal and other fluctuations. In particular, we have historically
experienced higher revenues during the second quarter and third quarter versus the first quarter and
fourth quarter during each fiscal year. This seasonality is caused primarily by more days of inclement
weather during the second quarter and third quarter in most of our markets, which contributes to a
greater number of vehicle accidents and damage during these periods. In addition, our business is
subject to fluctuations caused by other factors, including the occurrence of extraordinary weather
events and the timing of certain public holidays. For example, the Easter holiday occurs during the third
quarter in certain fiscal years and occurs during the fourth quarter in other fiscal years, resulting in a
change in the number of business days during the quarter in which the holiday occurs.

We anticipate that our revenues will continue to be subject to seasonality and therefore our
financial results will vary from period to period. However, actual results from operations may or may not
follow these normal seasonal patterns in a given year leading to performance that is not in alignment
with expectations.

40


-----

We also may experience variations in our earnings due to other factors beyond our control, such as:

‰ the introduction of new software or services by our competitors;

‰ customer acceptance of new software or services;

‰ the volume of usage of our offerings by existing customers;

‰ variations of vehicle accident rates due to factors such as changes in fuel prices, number of
miles driven or new vehicle purchases and their impact on vehicle usage;

‰ competitive conditions, or changes in competitive conditions, in our industry generally;

‰ prolonged system failures during which time customers cannot submit or process transactions;
or

‰ prolonged interruptions in our access to third-party data incorporated in our software and
services.

We may also incur significant or unanticipated expenses when contracts expire, are terminated or
are not renewed. Any of these events could harm our business, financial condition and results of
operations and cause our stock price to decline.

**_Our industry is subject to rapid technological changes, and if we fail to keep pace with these_**
**_changes or our present or future product offerings are diminished or made obsolete in the_**
**_marketplace, our market share and revenues will decline._**

Our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and
frequent introductions of, and enhancements to, existing software and services, all with an underlying
pressure to reduce cost. Industry changes could render our present or future product offerings
(including but not limited to our risk and asset management platform and our “digital garage” product)
less attractive or obsolete, and we may be unable to make the necessary adjustments to our present or
future product offerings at a competitive cost, or at all. We also incur substantial expenses in
researching, developing, designing, purchasing, licensing and marketing new software and services,
including but not limited to our risk and asset management platform and our “digital garage” product.
The development or adaptation of these new technologies and products may result in unanticipated
expenditures and capital costs that would not be recovered in the event that such new technologies or
products are unsuccessful. The research, development, production and marketing of new software and
services are also subject to changing market requirements, access to and rights to use third-party data,
the satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and customers’ approval procedures and other
factors, each of which could prevent us from successfully marketing any new software and services or
responding to competing technologies. The success of new software in our industry also often depends
on the ability to be first to market, and our failure to be first to market with any particular product
offering could limit our ability to recover the development expenses associated with such product. If we
cannot develop or acquire new technologies, software and services or any of our existing or anticipated
future product offerings (including but not limited to our risk and asset management platform and our
“digital garage” product) are diminished in value, made less attractive or rendered obsolete by
technological changes or present or future competitive products and services in the marketplace, our
revenues and income could decline and we may lose market share to our established or new
competitors, which would impact our future operations and financial results.

**_We are currently making, and anticipate making additional, strategic decisions and_**
**_investments to leverage and expand our product and service offerings, including offerings in_**
**_addition to the automotive sector._**

We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant management attention and
financial resources to develop, integrate and implement new business strategies, products, services,

41


-----

features, applications, and functionality (including but not limited to our risk and asset management
platform and our “digital garage” product). Such endeavors may involve significant risks and
uncertainties, including distraction of management from current core operations, insufficient revenues
to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of
capital on our investments, and unanticipated issues or problems that arise during our implementation
of such strategies and offerings. Because these new endeavors are inherently risky, our business
strategies and product and service offerings may not be successful and may adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Some of our strategies and offerings may be outside the insurance claims industry (such as our
SMR business, CAP and our “digital garage” product), may be outside of the automotive sector (such
as our property claims business and our “digital garage” product), or may be consumer-based (such as
our “digital garage” product). We have limited historical experience directly serving consumers or
customers outside of the automotive sector and our products and services may not be accepted or
widely utilized by such consumers or customers. These offerings may also subject us to new or
additional laws and regulations (including those relating to consumer protection) and may lead to
increased legal and regulatory compliance, risk and liability.

**_Changes in or violations by us or our customers of applicable government regulations could_**
**_reduce demand for or limit our ability to provide our software and services in those_**
**_jurisdictions._**

Our insurance company customers are subject to extensive government regulations, mainly at
the state level in the United States and at the country level in our non-U.S. markets. Some of these
regulations relate directly to our software and services, including regulations governing the use of total
loss and estimating software. If our insurance company customers fail to comply with new or existing
insurance regulations, including those applicable to our software and services, they could lose their
certifications to provide insurance and/or reduce their usage of our software and services, either of
which would reduce our revenues. Also, we are subject to direct regulation in some markets, and our
failure to comply with these regulations could significantly reduce our revenues or subject us to
government sanctions. In addition, future regulations could force us to implement costly changes to our
software and/or databases or have the effect of prohibiting or rendering less valuable one or more of
our offerings. Moreover, some states in the United States have changed and are contemplating
changes to their regulations to permit insurance companies to use book valuations or public source
valuations for total loss calculations, making our total loss software potentially less valuable to
insurance companies in those states. Some states have adopted total loss regulations that, among
other things, require insurers to use a methodology deemed acceptable to the respective government
agency.

We submit our methodology to such agencies, and if they do not approve our methodology, we
will not be able to perform total loss valuations in their respective states. Other states are considering
legislation that would limit the data that our software can provide to our insurance company customers.
In the event that demand for or our ability to provide our software and services decreases in particular
jurisdictions due to regulatory changes, our revenues and margins may decrease.

There is momentum to create a U.S. federal government oversight mechanism for the insurance
industry. There is also legislation under consideration by the U.S. legislature relating to the vehicle
repair industry. Federal regulatory oversight of or legislation relating to the insurance industry in the
United States could result in a broader impact on our business versus similar oversight or legislation at
the U.S. state level.

**_Regulatory developments could negatively impact our business._**

We acquire and distribute personal, public and non-public information, store it in our some of our
databases and provide it in various forms to certain of our customers in accordance with applicable law
and contracts. We are subject to government regulation and, from time to time, companies in similar
lines of business to us are subject to adverse publicity concerning the use of such data. We provide
many types of data and services that are subject to regulation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act,
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Driver’s Privacy Protection Act, Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act, the European Union’s Data Protection Directive, the United Kingdom’s Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 Order 2001, and, to a lesser extent, various other international, federal,
state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of
the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information. Our suppliers that provide us with
protected and regulated data face similar regulatory requirements and, consequently, they may cease
to be able to provide data to us or may substantially increase the fees they charge us for this data
which may make it financially burdensome or impossible for us to acquire data that is necessary to
offer our certain of our products and services. Additionally, many consumer advocates, privacy
advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately
protect privacy of personal information. They have become increasingly concerned with the use of
personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates
of birth. As a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of
personal information to the public and private sectors. The following legal and regulatory developments
also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or
cash flows:

‰ amendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations which restrict the access, use
and distribution of personal information and limit the supply of data available to customers;

‰ changes in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection
and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our services;

‰ failure of our services to comply with current or amended laws and regulations; and

‰ failure of our services to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an operational
effective, efficient, cost-effective manner.

**_We are active in over 75 countries, where we are subject to country-specific risks that could_**
**_adversely impact our business and results of operations._**

During fiscal year 2015 and the six months ended December 31, 2015, we generated
approximately 56% and 50% of our revenues, respectively, outside the United States and we expect
revenues from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a majority of our total revenues. Business
and operations in individual countries are subject to changes in local government regulations and
policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, currency exchange
controls and repatriation of earnings. Our results are also subject to the difficulties of coordinating our
activities across over 75 different countries. Furthermore, our business strategy includes expansion of
our operations into new and developing markets, which will require even greater international
coordination, expose us to additional local government regulations and involve markets in which we do
not have experience or established operations. In addition, our operations in each country are
vulnerable to changes in socio-economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies, intellectual
property protection disputes, the settlement of legal disputes through foreign legal systems, the
collection of receivables through foreign legal systems, exposure to possible expropriation or other
governmental actions, unsettled political conditions, possible terrorist attacks and pandemic disease.
These and other factors may harm our operations in those countries and therefore our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_We have a large amount of goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions._**
**_Our earnings will be harmed if we suffer an impairment of our goodwill or other intangible_**
**_assets._**

We have a large amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and are required to perform an
annual, or in certain situations a more frequent, assessment for possible impairment for accounting
purposes. At December 31, 2015, we had goodwill and other intangible assets of $2.8 billion, or
approximately 75% of our total assets. If we do not achieve our planned operating results or other
factors impair these assets, we may be required to incur a non-cash impairment charge. Any
impairment charges in the future will adversely affect our results of operations.

**_We may incur significant restructuring and severance charges in future periods, which would_**
**_harm our operating results and cash position or increase debt._**

We incurred restructuring charges of $6.3 million and $4.6 million during fiscal year 2015 and the
six months ended December 31, 2015, respectively. These charges consist primarily of relocation and
termination benefits paid or to be paid to employees, lease obligations associated with vacated
facilities and other costs incurred related to our restructuring initiatives. As of December 31, 2015, our
remaining restructuring and severance obligations associated with these restructuring initiatives were
$0.2 million.

We regularly evaluate our existing operations and capacity, and we expect to incur additional
restructuring charges as a result of future personnel reductions, related restructuring, and productivity
and technology enhancements, which could exceed the levels of our historical charges. In addition, we
may incur certain unforeseen costs as existing or future restructuring activities are implemented. Any of
these potential charges could harm our operating results and significantly reduce our cash position.

**_Our software and services rely on information generated by third parties and any interruption_**
**_of our access to such information could materially harm our operating results._**

We believe that our success depends significantly on our ability to provide our customers access
to data from many different sources. For example, a substantial portion of the data used in our repair
estimating software is derived from parts and repair data provided by, among others, OEMs,
aftermarket parts suppliers, data aggregators, automobile dealerships, government organizations and
vehicle repair facilities. We obtain much of our data about vehicle parts and components and collision
repair labor and costs through license agreements with OEMs, automobile dealers, and other
providers; and we obtain much of our data in our vehicle validation database and motor violation
database from government organizations. EurotaxGlass’s Group, one of our primary competitors in
Europe, provides us with valuation and paint data for use in our European markets pursuant to a
similar arrangement. In some cases, the data included in our products and services is licensed from
sole-source suppliers. Mitchell International, one of our primary competitors in the United States, has
historically provided us with vehicle glass data for use in our U.S. markets pursuant to a vehicle data
license agreement. Many of the license agreements through which we obtain data are for terms of one
year and may be terminated without cost to the provider on short notice.

If one or more of our licenses are terminated or if we are unable to renew one or more of these
licenses on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to access the information (in the case of
information licensed from sole-service suppliers) or unable to access alternative data sources that
would provide comparable information without incurring substantial additional costs. Some data
sources have indicated to us that they intend to materially increase the licensing costs for their data.
While we do not believe that our access to many of the individual sources of data is material to our
operations, prolonged industry-wide price increases or reductions in data availability could make
receiving certain data more difficult and could result in significant cost increases, which would
materially harm our operating results.

**_System failures, delays and other problems could harm our reputation and business, cause_**
**_us to lose customers and expose us to customer liability._**

Our success depends on our ability to provide accurate, consistent and reliable services and
information to our customers on a timely basis. Our operations could be interrupted by any damage to
or failure of:

‰ our computer software or hardware or our customers’ or third-party service providers’ computer
software or hardware;

‰ our networks, our customers’ networks or our third-party service providers’ networks; and

‰ our connections to and outsourced service arrangements with third parties, such as Acxiom,
which hosts data and applications for us and our customers.

Our systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from:

‰ power loss or other telecommunications failures;

‰ earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes and other natural disasters;

‰ computer viruses or software defects;

‰ physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and

‰ errors by our employees or third-party service providers.

As part of our ongoing process improvements efforts, we have and will continue to migrate
product and system platforms to next generation platforms and we may increase data and applications
that we host ourselves, and the risks noted above will be exacerbated by these efforts. Because many
of our services play a mission-critical role for our customers, any damage to or failure of the
infrastructure we rely on (even if temporary), including those of our customers and vendors, could
disrupt our ability to deliver information to and provide services for our customers in a timely manner,
which could harm our reputation and result in the loss of current and/or potential customers or reduced
business from current customers. In addition, we generally indemnify our customers to a limited extent
for damages they sustain related to the unavailability of, or errors in, the software and services we
provide; therefore, a significant interruption of, or errors in, our software and services could expose us
to significant customer liability.

**_Fraudulent data access and other security breaches may negatively impact our business and_**
**_harm our reputation._**

Security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our
business and reputation and result in a loss of customers and data suppliers. Our systems may be
vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems.
If users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify
confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks.

In addition, customers’ misuse of our information services could cause harm to our business and
reputation and result in loss of customers. Any such misappropriation and/or misuse of our information
could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation.

A security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways:

‰ deterring customers from using our solutions;

‰ deterring data suppliers from supplying data to us;

‰ harming our reputation;

45


-----

‰ exposing us to liability;

‰ increasing operating expenses to correct problems caused by the breach;

‰ affecting our ability to meet customers’ expectations; or

‰ causing inquiry from governmental authorities.

We may detect incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired.
The number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown.
Any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition,
operating results and cash flows.

**_Privacy concerns could require us to exclude data from our software and services, which_**
**_may reduce the value of our offerings to our customers, damage our reputation and deter_**
**_current and potential users from using our software and services._**

In the United States, European Union and other jurisdictions, there are significant restrictions on
the use of personal and consumer data. Our violations of these laws could harm our business. In
addition, these restrictions may place limits on the information that we can collect from and provide to
our customers. Furthermore, concerns about our collection, use or sharing of automobile insurance
claims information, moving violation information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded,
could damage our reputation and operating results.

**_We depend on a limited number of key personnel who would be difficult to replace. If we lose_**
**_the services of these individuals, or are unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of_**
**_qualified employees to support our present and future operations and business strategy, our_**
**_business will be adversely affected._**

We depend upon the ability and experience of our key personnel, who have substantial
experience with our operations, the rapidly changing automobile insurance claims processing industry
and the markets in which we offer our software and services. The loss of the services of one or more of
our senior executives or key employees, particularly our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive
Officer and President, Tony Aquila, could harm our business and operations.

Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, manage and retain qualified
management, sales and technical personnel as we grow and implement our present and future
business strategy. Particularly, we have a present and anticipated future need to attract, manage and
retain sufficient numbers of appropriately qualified personnel to develop and commercialize our risk
and asset management platform and our “digital garage” product offering. Competition for such
qualified personnel is intense and we may not be able to continue to attract or retain such qualified
personnel in the future.

**_Our business depends on our brands, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our_**
**_brands, our business and operating results could be harmed._**

We believe that the brand identity we have developed and acquired has significantly contributed
to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands, such as
Solera, Solera Holdings, Audatex, ABZ, Hollander, Informex, Sidexa, HPI, AUTOonline, Market Scan,
IMS, Identifix, AutoPoint, LYNX Services, CAP and Explore, are critical to the expansion of our
software and services to new customers in both existing and new markets. Maintaining and enhancing
our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be
successful. If we fail to promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this

46


-----

effort, our business, operating results and financial condition will be harmed. We anticipate that, as our
markets become increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brands may become
increasingly difficult and expensive. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our
ability to be a technology innovator, to continue to provide high quality software and services and
protect and defend our brand names and trademarks, which we may not do successfully. To date, we
have not engaged in extensive direct brand promotion activities, and we may not successfully
implement brand enhancement efforts in the future.

**_Third parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights, and we_**
**_could be prevented from selling our software or suffer significant litigation expense even if_**
**_these claims have no merit._**

Our competitive position is driven in part by our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
Third parties, however, may claim that our software, products or technology, including claims data or
other data, which we obtain from other parties, are infringing or otherwise violating their intellectual
property rights. We may also develop software, products or technology, unaware of pending patent
applications of others, which software products or technology may infringe a third party patent once
that patent is issued. Any claims of intellectual property infringement or other violation, even claims
without merit, could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could divert our management and key
personnel from operating our business. In addition, if any third party has a meritorious or successful
claim that we are infringing or violating its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our
software or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties, which may be costly or impractical.
These claims may also require us to stop selling our software and/or services as currently designed,
which could harm our competitive position. We also may be subject to significant damages or
injunctions that prevent the further development and sale of certain of our software or services and
may result in a material loss in revenue. Currently, one of our trademarks is subject to a nullification
proceeding in front of the Brazil trademark authority.

**_We may be unable to protect our intellectual property and property rights, either without_**
**_incurring significant costs or at all, which would harm our business._**

We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, patents, license
agreements and contractual provisions, as well as internal procedures, to establish and protect our
intellectual property rights. The steps we have taken and will take to protect our intellectual property
rights may not deter infringement, duplication, misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property
by third parties. In addition, any of the intellectual property we own or license from third parties may be
challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable, or may not be of sufficient scope or
strength to provide us with any meaningful information. Furthermore, because of the differences in
foreign patent, trademark and other laws concerning proprietary rights, our software and other
intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they
would in the United States, if at all. We may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and
unpatented proprietary technology in these countries. We may also be unable to prevent the
unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge, trade secrets or other proprietary
information by consultants, vendors, former employees or current employees, despite the existence of
nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, intellectual property assignments and other contractual
restrictions. It is also possible that others will independently develop the technology that is the same or
similar to ours. If our trade secrets and other proprietary information become known or we are unable
to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property, we may not receive any return on the
resources expended to create the intellectual property or generate any competitive advantage based
on it.

47


-----

We rely on our brands to distinguish our products and services from the products and services of
our competitors, and have registered or applied to register trademarks covering many of these brands.
We cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose
our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our
trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products and services,
which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising
and marketing new brands.

Third parties, including competitors, may infringe our intellectual property rights and we may not
have adequate resources to enforce our intellectual property rights. Pursuing infringers of our
intellectual property could result in significant monetary costs and diversion of management resources,
and any failure to pursue or successfully litigate claims against infringers or otherwise enforce our
intellectual property rights could result in competitors using our technology and offering similar
products and services, potentially resulting in loss of our competitive advantage and decreased
revenues.

Currently, we believe that one or more of our customers in our EMEA segment may be infringing
our intellectual property by making and distributing unauthorized copies of our software. Enforcement
of our intellectual property rights may be difficult and may require considerable resources.

**_Our lawsuit against Mitchell International, Inc. for patent infringement has been adversely_**
**_decided against us and we cannot predict the duration, outcome or cost of any appeal of the_**
**_decision._**

On February 6, 2012, we filed a lawsuit against Mitchell International, Inc. in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware for infringement of one of our U.S. patents and we
subsequently added an additional two continuation patents to the lawsuit. On February 24, 2015, at
Mitchell International’s request, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) instituted a Covered
Business Method Patent Review (“CBM”) of the patents at issue in the lawsuit. In so doing, the USPTO
preliminarily determined that it is more likely than not that the claims of such patents are not eligible for
patent protection. On March 24, 2015, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
California, where the lawsuit now resides, issued an order to stay the lawsuit pending the ruling of the
USPTO in the CBM proceeding. Oral argument of the CBM proceeding was held before the USPTO on
October 19, 2015. On February 19, 2016, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the USPTO
published three separate decisions in the CBM proceeding. The PTAB decisions invalidated the three
patents at issue, citing the U.S. Supreme Court’s prior decision in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank
International.

We are currently evaluating our response to the PTAB decisions, including whether to appeal the
PTAB decisions to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We expect that any such appeal
could require a substantial period of time to litigate and, at this stage, we cannot predict the duration,
outcome or cost of such appeal.

**_Current or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on us._**

We have been and continue to be involved in legal proceedings, claims and other litigation that
arise in the ordinary course of business. For example, we have been involved in disputes with collision
repair facilities, acting individually and as a group in some situations that claim that we have colluded
with our insurance company customers to depress the repair time estimates generated by our repair
estimating software. We have also been involved in litigation alleging that we have colluded with our
insurance company customers to cause the estimates of vehicle fair market value generated by our
total loss estimation software to be unfairly low. On February 28, 2014, Solera, Explore, and Audatex

North America, Inc. were each served with a civil complaint filed against them and another defendant
by an insurance company third party claimant in Minnesota state court. The complaint seeks state-wide
class action status for similarly situated claimants, claiming that the defendant’s methodology for
determining the value of total loss vehicles violates Minnesota law. We filed a motion to dismiss on
April 18, 2014. The complaint was subsequently removed to the U.S. District Court for the District of
Minnesota and an amended complaint was filed on July 16, 2014. We and our co-defendant moved to
dismiss the amended complaint and on October 31, 2014, the Court issued an order dismissing two of
the three counts with prejudice and, of the remaining count, dismissing one claim with prejudice and
one claim without prejudice.

On September 21, 2015, an alleged stockholder of the Company filed an action in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware on behalf of a putative class of the Company’s stockholders against
us and our directors, Vista, Parent and Merger Sub. The complaint alleges, among other things, that
our directors breached their fiduciary duties by approving the Merger Agreement at an inadequate
price and following an inadequate sale process, and that we, Vista, Parent and Merger Sub aided and
abetted these alleged breaches of duty. The complainant seeks, among other things, either to enjoin
the proposed transaction or to rescind it should it be consummated, as well as an award of plaintiff’s
attorneys’ fees and costs in the action. On October 13, 2015, the defendants moved to dismiss the
complaint for failure to state a claim. On October 21, 2015, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint that
added allegations contending that the disclosure contained in the preliminary version of our proxy
statement related to the Merger misstated or failed to disclose certain allegedly material information to
our stockholders. On October 22, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking
to enjoin the holding of our shareholder meeting based upon his claim that our public disclosures were
inadequate. On November 5, 2015, the Court denied the motion for expedited proceedings, and
declined to consider plaintiff’s motion seeking to enjoin the special meeting. The defendants deny any
wrongdoing in connection with the merger and plan to defend vigorously against the claims set forth in
the amended complaint and any injunction motion.

On November 17, 2015, a duplicative action was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware against our directors on behalf of the same putative class of the Company’s stockholders,
alleging similar claims for breach of fiduciary duty and challenging the Merger and the disclosures
relating to the Merger. On December 23, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action.

On January 29, 2016, the Court entered an order consolidating the two related cases for all
purposes, appointing a lead plaintiff and lead counsel, and granting lead plaintiff until 20 days following
the closing of the Merger to file any consolidated amended complaint. The defendants deny any
wrongdoing in connection with the Merger and plan to defend vigorously against the claims set forth in
these actions.

Furthermore, we are also subject to assertions by our customers and strategic partners that we
have not complied with the terms of our agreements with them or that the agreements are not
enforceable against them, some of which are the subject of pending litigation and any of which could in
the future lead to arbitration or litigation. While we do not expect the outcome of any such pending or
threatened litigation to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, litigation is
unpredictable and excessive verdicts, both in the form of monetary damages and injunction, could
occur. In the future, we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could harm our
financial position and results of operations.

**_We are subject to periodic changes in the amount of our income tax provision (benefit) and_**
**_these changes could adversely affect our operating results; we may not be able to utilize all_**
**_of our tax benefits before they expire._**

Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by our mix of earnings in countries with high
versus low tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by a change
in our assertion that our foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested; by the outcomes of examinations,
audits or disputes by or with relevant tax authorities; or by changes in tax laws and regulations.

Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes
prescribed in ASC Topic No. 740-10, Income Taxes. In addition, ASC Topic No. 740-10 applies to all
income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled
unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital.

**_We are subject to adverse changes in our liquidity if we initiate action to repatriate_**
**_unremitted earnings and precipitate payments of U.S. income taxes._**

Our foreign subsidiaries generate earnings that are not subject to U.S. income taxes so long as
they are permanently reinvested in our operations outside of the United States. Pursuant to ASC Topic
No. 740-30 (formerly APB 23), undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are no longer
permanently reinvested would become subject to deferred income taxes under U.S. tax law. In
determining if the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested, we
consider the following: (i) the forecasts, budgets and cash requirements of our U.S. business and our
foreign subsidiaries, both for the short and long term; (ii) the tax consequences of any decision to
reinvest foreign earnings, including any changes in U.S. income tax law relating to the treatment of
these undistributed foreign earnings; and (iii) any U.S. and foreign government programs or regulations
relating to the repatriation of these unremitted earnings. In fiscal year 2015, we have concluded that
$350.0 million of our foreign earnings are no longer permanently reinvested, and we have recognized
deferred income taxes on these earnings. If we initiate actions to repatriate these unremitted earnings
and precipitate payments of U.S. income taxes, such payments could materially adversely affect our
liquidity. We continue to assert that the remaining $840.7 million of undistributed earnings generated
through December 31, 2015 is permanently reinvested in our foreign operations and have no current
plans to repatriate those earnings.

**_Affiliates of Vista will control us and their interests may conflict with our interests or the_**
**_interests of the holders of the notes in the future._**

Following the consummation of the Transactions, Solera will be an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent and Parent will be an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a parent company of
which all or substantially all of the issued and outstanding capital stock will be beneficially owned by
certain funds affiliated with Vista. In addition, Vista will have the right to designate all of the members of
our board of directors and the boards of directors and managers of our parent companies. As a result,
Vista has control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and has the ability to
prevent any transaction that requires the approval of our board of directors or stockholders, regardless
of whether the holders of notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For
example, Vista could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness,
including secured indebtedness, or to sell assets, which may impair our ability to make payments
under the notes.

In addition, Vista is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to
time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. While we do
not currently compete with these investments, Vista may vote in a manner so as to restrict us from
expanding our business or entering into additional lines of business which may be related to the

50


-----

current or future operations of these investments. Vista may also pursue acquisitions that may be
complementary with our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available
to us. So long as Vista continues to indirectly own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of
Solera common stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, Vista will continue to be able to strongly
influence or effectively control our decisions.

**_We will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002._**

Since we will not register the notes under the Securities Act after this offering, we will not be
subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), which requires public
companies to have and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely
disclosure of material information, and have management review the effectiveness of those controls on
a quarterly basis. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires public companies to have and maintain
effective internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements, and have management review
the effectiveness of those controls on an annual basis (and have the independent auditor attest to the
effectiveness of such internal controls). We will not be required to comply with these requirements and
therefore we may not have comparable procedures in place as compared to other public companies.

**Risks Related to the Merger**

**_Our business relationships, including customer relationships, may be subject to disruption_**
**_due to uncertainty associated with the Merger._**

Parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future, including
customers, may experience uncertainty associated with the Merger, including with respect to current or
future business relationships. As a result, our business relationships may be subject to disruptions if
customers, suppliers and others attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or
consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us. These disruptions could have a
material and adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects
following the closing of this offering. The effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in
the consummation of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement.

**_Holders of a substantial number of shares of Solera common stock have purported to have_**
**_delivered written demands for the appraisal of their shares under Delaware law. If these_**
**_appraisal demands are not withdrawn or determined to be invalid, or do not otherwise cease_**
**_under Delaware law, the claims represented by such appraisal demands will constitute a_**
**_substantial contingent liability of ours and will also result in our incurring substantial interest_**
**_charges until they are resolved._**

Holders of shares of Solera common stock who did not vote in favor of the proposal to approve
the Merger and who properly demanded appraisal of their shares and who otherwise comply with the
requirements of Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) will
be entitled to seek appraisal for, and obtain payment in cash for the judicially determined “fair value”
(as defined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL) of, their shares in lieu of receiving the Acquisition
Consideration if the Merger is completed, but only if they comply with all applicable requirements of
Delaware law. This appraised value could be more than, the same as, or less than the Acquisition
Consideration of $55.85 per share. As of February 26, 2016, we have received purported demands for
appraisal with respect to approximately 7,149,364 shares.

Upon completion of the Merger, we expect to record a liability of $55.85 for each share with
respect to which appraisal has been properly demanded (representing approximately $399.3 million if
appraisal has been properly demanded with respect to all of the approximately 7,149,364 shares for

51


-----

which appraisal demands have purported to have been delivered as of February 26, 2016). In addition,
we anticipate incurring interest charges equal to a per annum rate (compounded quarterly) of 5% over
the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) in respect of such liability.

At any time during the 60-day period after the Effective Time, any stockholder who has not
actually commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined an appraisal proceeding as a named party may
withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal, in which event we will be obligated to promptly pay to
such stockholder the Acquisition Consideration of $55.85 per share in cash, without interest. After such
60-day period, any demand for appraisal can be withdrawn only with our approval and, if an appraisal
proceeding has been commenced, with the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Within
120 days after the Effective Time, we or any holder of our shares who properly has exercised its
appraisal rights may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders exercising
appraisal rights. If no such petition is filed within that 120-day period, all appraisal rights will cease, and
we will be required to promptly pay the Acquisition Consideration of $55.85 per share in cash, without
interest, to all stockholders who exercised appraisal rights.

If an appraisal proceeding is commenced within 120 days after the Effective Time, the appraisal
proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Chancery Court. Through
such proceeding, the court shall determine the fair value of the shares, exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger. Unless the Court of Chancery in
its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on such fair value from the Effective
Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at a
per annum rate of 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established
from time to time. It has not been unusual for appraisal proceedings in the Court of Chancery to take
several years from the merger effective date to be concluded by a judgment, although there is no
assurance as to the actual timing of any such proceeding. At the conclusion of an appraisal
proceeding, the Court of Chancery directs the corporation surviving the merger to pay the fair value,
plus any interest. Upon a stockholder filing a petition for appraisal, we can settle with the stockholder
following approval of the Delaware Chancery Court.

In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant
factors and the fair value so determined could be more than, the same as or less than the Acquisition
Consideration. There is no assurance that the Delaware Court of Chancery will not determine that the
fair value of the shares is materially greater than the Acquisition Consideration.

Any payment in respect of the shares subject to appraisal rights will be required to be paid in
cash. As we are not able to determine the timing or amount of such payments, our liquidity position
may be adversely affected. At the time such payments are required to be made, we may decide to sell
our assets or otherwise raise money (including through the issuance of additional equity from the
Common Equity Investors or other financing sources or the incurrence of additional debt) in order to
have sufficient cash to satisfy our obligations in respect of appraisal rights. We may not have sufficient
cash to satisfy our obligations in respect of appraisal rights.

**Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us_**
**_from fulfilling our obligations under the notes._**

After giving effect to the Transactions, we will have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which
will require significant interest and principal payments. As of December 31, 2015, after giving pro forma
effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately $3,930.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of indebtedness, and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our estimated

52


-----

aggregate interest expense and cash paid for interest would have been approximately $336.8 million
and $310.2 million, respectively. We would also have had unused availability under the New Revolving
Facility of $300.0 million.

Our and our subsidiaries’ substantial amount of indebtedness could have important
consequences to holders of the notes, including:

‰ continuing to require us and certain of our subsidiaries to dedicate a substantial portion of our
cash flow from operations to the payment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds
available for operations and any future business opportunities;

‰ limiting flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which
we operate;

‰ placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less
indebtedness;

‰ increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;

‰ making us and our subsidiaries more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings
under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates; and

‰ limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and increasing our cost of borrowing.

Pursuant to agreements entered into prior to the CSG Acquisition (as defined below), the
noncontrolling stockholders of certain of our majority-owned subsidiaries have the right to require us to
redeem their shares at the then fair market value. For financial statement reporting purposes, the
estimated fair market value of these redeemable noncontrolling interests was $80.8 million at
December 31, 2015.

**_Our ability to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, depends on many factors_**
**_beyond our control, and if we cannot generate enough cash to service our indebtedness, we_**
**_may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which_**
**_may not be successful._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations with respect to our
debt, including the notes, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is
subject to prevailing economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal and regulatory factors and other
factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating
activities sufficient to permit us to fund our day-to-day operations or to pay the principal, premium, if
any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes.

Cash flows from operations are the principal source of funding for us. Our business may not
generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. If our cash flows
are insufficient to service our indebtedness, including the notes, we may be forced to reduce or delay
capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness,
including the notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the
capital and credit markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be
at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could
further restrict our business operations and limit our financial flexibility. In addition, the terms of existing
or future debt agreements, including the credit agreements that will govern the New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes, may restrict us from adopting some of
these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our
outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which

53


-----

could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be
successful or may be insufficient and, as a result, our liquidity and financial condition could be
adversely affected and we may not be able to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.

In addition, we operate in a multi-tiered holding company structure and do not directly conduct
any business operations or hold any material asset other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries.
Because substantially all of our operating assets are held by our subsidiaries, we will rely principally on
cash generated from the operations of certain of our subsidiaries to pay the principal and interest on
the notes. Unless they are guarantors of the notes or our other indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not
have any obligation to pay amounts due on the notes or our other indebtedness or to make funds
available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities, and may be
restricted from making distributions by, among other things, applicable corporate laws, other laws and
regulations and the terms of agreements to which they are or may become a party. While the indenture
that will govern the notes and the credit agreements that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities will limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay
dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to qualifications
and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be
unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the notes.

If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the notes
could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings, and we
could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. All of these events could result in your losing your
investment in the notes.

**_Despite our substantial level of indebtedness, the indenture that will govern the notes will_**
**_permit us and our subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness. This could_**
**_further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future.
Although the credit agreement that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
indenture that will govern the notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness,
these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness
incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions do not
prevent us or our subsidiaries from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If we incur
any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes, the holders of that debt will be entitled to
share ratably with you in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation,
reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our company, subject to any collateral arrangements.
This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you. In addition, as of
December 31, 2015, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our New Revolving
Facility would have provided for unused availability of $300.0 million. Any such borrowings and the
borrowings under our New Term Loan Facility would be secured indebtedness and therefore would be
effectively senior to the notes and the note guarantees by the guarantors to the extent of the value of
the assets securing such debt. To the extent we and our subsidiaries incur further indebtedness, the
substantial risks related to our level of indebtedness would increase. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes.”

54


-----

**_The notes and the guarantees are unsecured and are effectively subordinated to our and our_**
**_guarantors’ indebtedness under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and any of our_**
**_other secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the property securing that_**
**_indebtedness._**

The notes and the note guarantees are not secured by any of our or our subsidiaries’ assets and
therefore are effectively subordinated to the claims of our secured debt holders to the extent of the
value of the assets securing such debt. As of December 31, 2015, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the Transactions, we would have had $2,200.0 million in secured debt under the New Term
Loan Facility and our New Revolving Facility would have provided for unused availability of
$300.0 million, all of which would have been effectively senior to the notes to the extent of the value of
the assets securing such indebtedness. If we become insolvent or are liquidated, or if payment under
the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities is accelerated, the lenders under the New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities will be entitled to exercise the remedies available to a secured lender under applicable
law (in addition to any remedies that may be available under documents pertaining to the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities). In addition, we and/or the guarantors may incur additional senior secured
indebtedness, the holders of which will also be entitled to the remedies available to a secured lender.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes.”

**_Our debt agreements contain restrictions that could limit our flexibility in operating our_**
**_business._**

The operating and financial covenants and restrictions in the credit agreements that will govern
the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby and
other debt that we incur in the future may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or
capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. The agreements
governing our indebtedness will restrict, subject to certain important exceptions and qualifications, our
and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:

‰ incur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness;

‰ pay dividends or make distributions or make certain other restricted payments;

‰ make certain investments;

‰ create liens on our or our guarantors’ assets;

‰ sell assets;

‰ enter into transactions with affiliates;

‰ enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

‰ designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and

‰ enter into mergers or consolidations or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

A breach of the covenants or restrictions under the indenture that will govern the notes or under
the credit agreements that will govern our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities could result in an event
of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the
related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or
cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the credit agreements that will
govern our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities would permit the lenders under our New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility.
Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that
indebtedness. In the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we

55


-----

and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these
restrictions, we may be:

‰ limited in how we conduct our business;

‰ unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or
business downturns; or

‰ unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.

These restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our
financial results, our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the
availability and terms of our financing.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt_**
**_service obligations to increase significantly._**

Borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and
expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the
variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and
our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will
correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2015, after giving effect to the Transactions,
approximately $2,200.0 million of our debt would have been variable rate debt, and holding other
variables constant, an increase or decrease in interest rates by 0.25% (25 basis points) on our variable
rate debt would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $5.5 million. In the
future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest
payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps
with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate
our interest rate risk.

**_The notes and the note guarantees are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our non-_**
**_guarantor subsidiaries._**

The notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our non-guarantor
subsidiaries, which will include, among others, all our subsidiaries formed outside of the United States.
The indenture that will govern the notes will allow any non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur certain
additional indebtedness in the future and will not limit the incurrence of liabilities that do not constitute
indebtedness. Furthermore, we may, under certain circumstances described in the indenture that will
govern the notes, designate subsidiaries to be unrestricted subsidiaries, and any subsidiary that is
designated as unrestricted will not guarantee the notes. Any right that the Issuers or the guarantors have
to receive any assets of any non-guarantor subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of those
subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of holders of the notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of
those subsidiaries’ assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of those non-guarantor
subsidiaries’ creditors, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests of those
subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of any non-guarantor subsidiaries,
holders of their debt, including their trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding indebtedness
or guarantees issued by those subsidiaries, are generally entitled to payment on their claims from assets
of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to us.

As of December 31, 2015, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would not have had any indebtedness
(excluding intercompany liabilities). Our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately
$622.5 million, or 51.9%, of our revenues, and approximately $293.5 million, or 63.9%, of our Adjusted
EBITDA, in each case for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the effect of

56


-----

intercompany balances as well as intercompany transactions, our non-guarantor subsidiaries,
accounted for approximately $1,231.1 million, or 33.2%, of our total assets, and approximately $251.5
million, or 6.9%, of our total liabilities, in each case as of December 31, 2015.

The financial information included elsewhere in this offering circular, including the audited and
unaudited consolidated financial statements and pro forma financial information, reflect the financial
position of the guarantors and our non-guarantor subsidiaries on a consolidated basis and may be of
limited use in assessing the financial position of the guarantors on a separate basis.

**_The lenders under our New Term Loan Facility will have the discretion to release guarantors_**
**_under such facility in a variety of circumstances, which will cause those guarantors to be_**
**_released from their guarantees of the notes._**

So long as any obligations under our New Term Loan Facility remain outstanding, any guarantee
of the notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the notes or the trustee
under the indenture that will govern the notes if, at the discretion of lenders under our New Term Loan
Facility, the related guarantor is no longer a guarantor of obligations under our New Term Loan Facility.
The lenders under our New Term Loan Facility will have the discretion to release the guarantees under
our New Term Loan Facility in a variety of circumstances. Any of our subsidiaries that are released as
guarantors of our New Term Loan Facility will automatically be released as guarantors of the notes.
You will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the notes,
and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of
those subsidiaries will effectively be senior to your claims as a holder of the notes.

**_We may not be able to purchase the notes upon a change of control, which would result in a_**
**_default under the indenture that will govern the notes and would materially adversely affect_**
**_our business and financial condition._**

Upon a change of control as described under “Description of Notes,” we are required to make an
offer to purchase all of the notes then outstanding at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of purchase. Additionally, under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, a
change of control (as defined therein) constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to
accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the respective agreements and terminate their
commitments to lend. The source of funds for any purchase of the notes and repayment of borrowings
under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities would be our available cash or cash generated from
other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds provided by our existing
or new stockholders. We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control because
we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered
upon a change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due. If we fail to
repurchase the notes in that circumstance, we will be in default under the indenture that will govern the
notes. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases, and we may
be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to repurchase the notes
may be limited by law. In addition, certain corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that
would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a “change of control” under the
indenture even though those corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or
otherwise adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the notes. See
“Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.”

57


-----

**_Holders of the notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to_**
**_their right to have the notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of substantially all of_**
**_our assets._**

One of the circumstances under which a change of control may occur is upon the sale or disposition
of all or substantially all of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law, and the interpretation of that phrase will likely depend upon
particular facts and circumstances. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of the notes to require us to
repurchase its notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain.

**_Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and/or the_**
**_note guarantees and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes._**

Our creditors and the creditors of the guarantors of the notes could challenge the issuance of the
notes or the guarantors’ issuance of their note guarantees, respectively, as fraudulent conveyances or
on other grounds. Under U.S. bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer
laws, which may vary from state to state, a court could void the issuance of the notes and/or a note
guarantee or claims related to the notes or subordinate a note guarantee to all of our other debts or to
all other debts of a guarantor if, among other things, we or a guarantor, at the time we or such
guarantor incurred the indebtedness:

‰ intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; or

‰ received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the delivery of the notes
or the guarantee, as the case may be, and if the Issuers or guarantor:

       - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

       - was engaged in a business or transaction for which the Issuers’ or the guarantor’s
remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or

       - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such
debts as they mature.

In addition, a court could void any payment by a guarantor pursuant to the notes or a note
guarantee and require that payment be returned to such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the
creditors of the guarantor. If the notes or note guarantees were avoided or limited under fraudulent
transfer or other laws, any claim you may make against the Issuers or the guarantors for amounts
payable on the notes would be unenforceable to the extent of such avoidance or limitation. Moreover,
the court could order you to return any payments previously made by the Issuers or the guarantors.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the
governing law in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally,
however, a party would be considered insolvent if:

‰ the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of
all of its assets;

‰ the present fair saleable value of all of its assets was less than the amount that would be
required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they
become absolute and mature; or

‰ it could not pay its debts as they become due.

We cannot be certain what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or,
regardless of the standard, that a court would not avoid the notes or note guarantees.

58


-----

The indenture that will govern the notes will contain a “savings clause” intended to limit each
guarantor’s liability under its guarantee to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the
guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer under applicable law. There can be no assurance that this
provision will be upheld as intended. In a Florida bankruptcy case (which was reinstated by the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in 2012 on other grounds), this type of provision
was found to be ineffective to protect guarantors.

**_Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend_**
**_to register the notes under applicable securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to_**
**_transfer and resell the notes without registration under applicable securities laws._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and we do not currently intend to register the notes.
The holders of the notes will not be entitled to require us to register the notes for resale or otherwise.
Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a transaction registered
under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities
laws, except that holders will not be permitted to transfer the notes in reliance on Rule 144 even after
the applicable holding period has been satisfied. You may be required to bear the risk of your
investment for an indefinite period of time. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will not apply to us if the_**
**_notes are rated investment grade by both Moody’s and S&P._**

Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will cease to apply to a series of
notes during such time, if any, as the notes of such series are rated investment grade by both Moody’s
and S&P, provided that at such time no default has occurred and is continuing. Although there can be
no assurance that the notes of a series will ever be rated investment grade, or if they are rated
investment grade, that the notes of such series will maintain these ratings, any suspension of the
covenants under the indenture would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be
permitted while these covenants were in effect. To the extent any suspended covenants are
subsequently reinstated, any actions taken by us while the covenants were suspended would not result
in an event of default under the indenture on the basis that such actions would have been prohibited by
the covenants. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**_Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market,_**
**_and an active trading market may not develop for the notes._**

The notes will be a new issue of securities for which there is no established trading market. We
expect the notes to be eligible for trading by “qualified institutional buyers,” as defined under Rule
144A, but we do not intend to list the notes on any national securities exchange or to arrange for
quotation on any automated dealer quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they
intend to make a market in the notes, as permitted by applicable laws and regulations; however, the
initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the notes and, if commenced, they may
discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore, an active market for
the notes may not develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the market price and
liquidity of the notes. In such case, the holders of the notes may not be able to sell their notes at a
particular time or at a favorable price. If a trading market were to develop, future trading prices of the
notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors, including:

‰ the number of holders of notes;

‰ our operating performance and financial condition;

‰ the market for similar securities;

59


-----

‰ the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes; and

‰ prevailing interest rates.

Even if an active trading market for the notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will
continue.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the
notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in
that market or the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial
issuance, the notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing
interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors.

**_A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to the_**
**_notes, if any, could cause the liquidity or market value of the notes to decline._**

The notes have been rated by rating agencies. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell
or hold the notes. We cannot assure you that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of
time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating
agency’s judgment, circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our
business, so warrant. Any lowering or withdrawal of a rating by a rating agency could reduce the
liquidity or market value of the notes.

**_The notes will be treated as issued with OID for United States federal income tax purposes._**

The notes will be treated as issued with OID for United States federal income tax purposes in an
amount equal to the difference between their stated principal amount and their issue price. As a result,
a holder subject to United States federal income taxation will be required to include the OID in gross
income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis), in advance of the
receipt of the corresponding cash payments, regardless of such holder’s regular method of accounting
for United States federal income tax purposes. See “Certain United States Federal Tax
Considerations.”

**_If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us, holders of the notes may receive a lesser_**
**_amount for their claim than they would have been entitled to receive under the indenture_**
**_governing such notes._**

If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after the
issuance of the notes, the claim by any holder of the notes for the principal amount of such notes may
be limited to an amount equal to the sum of:

‰ the original issue price for such notes; and

‰ that portion of the OID that does not constitute “unmatured interest” for purposes of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code.

Any OID that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing would constitute
unmatured interest. Accordingly, holders of the notes under these circumstances may receive a lesser
amount than they would be entitled to under the terms of the indenture governing such notes, even if
sufficient funds are available.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The following table summarizes the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the
Transactions, assuming the Transactions occurred on December 31, 2015. The actual amounts set
forth in the table and in the accompanying footnotes are subject to adjustment and may differ at the
time of the consummation of the Transactions depending on several factors, including, without
limitation, differences at closing in the amount of outstanding shares, the amount of outstanding debt
and accrued interest, the amount of debt incurred by us and the amount of common and preferred
equity provided to us in connection with funding the Merger and any changes made to the sources of
the contemplated debt and equity financings, changes in our working capital, cash and cash
equivalents and differences from our estimation of fees and expenses. Upon consummation of the
offering of the notes, the net proceeds of the notes will be used to fund a portion of the Transactions as
set forth below.

You should read the following together with “The Transactions,” “Capitalization” and “Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Pro Forma Financial Information.”

(1) In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into the New Revolving Facility, which we expect will
provide for a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $300.0 million. As of December 31,
2015, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our unused availability under our New
Revolving Facility would have been approximately $300.0 million. We do not expect to borrow under the
New Revolving Facility in connection with the Transactions. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities.”
(2) In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into the New Term Loan Facility, which we expect will
provide for a seven-year senior secured term loan of $2,200.0 million, including a U.S. dollar tranche and the
U.S. dollar equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of a euro tranche. The amount shown excludes any
original issue discount. Any original issue discount will be amortized and included as interest expense in our
statement of income and comprehensive income over the life of the term loans. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness—New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.”
(3) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the notes offered hereby.
(4) Represents the approximate cash preferred equity contribution to be made to Parent by BSPI and KSISH (all
of the preferred equity financing provided to Parent will be contributed to the Issuer as common equity).
(5) Represents the approximate cash common equity contribution to be made by VEPFV and certain other
investors arranged by and/or designated by Vista. The cash common equity contribution is expected to be
reduced by approximately $278 million, the Appraisal Demand Amount, which is not expected to be funded
by Common Equity Investors at the closing of the Merger. The cash common equity contribution will be
reduced by the aggregate amount the Common Equity Investors elect not to fund. Approximately $121
million related to demands for appraisal will be funded at the closing of the Merger.
(6) Reflects our estimate of the total consideration to be paid to holders of all of the issued and outstanding
shares of Solera common stock that are entitled to receive the Acquisition Consideration and the settlement
of vested and unvested stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units in
the Merger, net of $358.2 million of cash from the balance sheet. This amount assumes that all of the
outstanding shares will receive the Acquisition Consideration, and we have not made any adjustments for
any potential liabilities resulting from any appraisal rights proceedings. Amounts not paid at the closing of the
Transactions as a result of appraisal rights may be used by us for other general purposes.

61


-----

As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of $470.5 million in cash and cash equivalents without
giving effect to the Transactions. We expect that at the time of the closing of the Transactions (prior to giving
effect to the Transactions), our cash and cash equivalents will be approximately $480.0 million and that
approximately $391.0 million of the cash and cash equivalents balance at closing will be used to fund the
Transactions, with $210.3 million (includes $121.3 million relating to demands for appraisal that will be
funded at closing) of the remainder available as cash for working capital to fund operations. To the extent
that our cash and cash equivalents balance at the time of the closing of the Transactions is greater than
$480.0 million, such additional cash and cash equivalents will be used to fund the Transactions, and the
cash equity contribution described in footnote (5) above will be reduced by the difference between the cash
balance at closing used to fund the Transactions and $480.0 million. To the extent that our cash and cash
equivalents balance at the time of the closing of the Transactions is less than $480.0 million, the cash equity
contribution described in footnote (5) above will be increased by the difference between the cash balance at
closing used to fund the Transactions and $480.0 million. The statements in this footnote regarding our
expected cash and cash equivalents balance at the closing of the Transactions do not include any impact
due to our outstanding foreign currency exchange derivative financial instruments, including any impact
attributable to any termination thereof, which amounts could be material.
(7) As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2021
Senior Notes and $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2023 Senior Notes. This
amount assumes all of the Existing Notes are tendered in connection with the Tender Offers and excludes
any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any unamortized net premium. As of February 29, 2016,
99.96% of the 2021 Senior Notes and 99.96% of the 2023 Senior Notes have been tendered. The 2021
Senior Notes bear interest at 6.000% per annum and are scheduled to mature on June 15, 2021, and the
2023 Senior Notes bear interest at 6.125% per annum and are scheduled to mature on November 1, 2023.
See “The Transactions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Pre-Transactions.”
(8) Reflects our estimate of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including early tender
participation premiums and accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes, original issue discount,
placement fees, initial purchaser discounts, underwriting and other financing fees, advisory fees and other
transaction costs and professional fees. The amount included on account of accrued and unpaid interest on
the Existing Notes is through December 31, 2015. We estimate the additional accrued interest on the
Existing Notes through the expected closing date will be approximately $32.8 million. To the extent any
financing fees, accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes, original issue discount and other fees and
expenses exceed the estimated amounts, we expect to fund such amounts with cash on our balance sheet
at the closing of the Transactions.

(1) As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of $470.5 million in cash and cash equivalents
without giving effect to the Transactions. We expect that at the time of the closing of the
Transactions (prior to giving effect to the Transactions), our cash and cash equivalents will be
approximately $480.0 million and that approximately $391.0 million of the cash and cash
equivalents balance at closing will be used to fund the Transactions, with $210.3 million (includes
$121.3 million relating to demands for appraisal that will be funded at closing) of the remainder
available as cash for working capital to fund operations. To the extent that our cash and cash
equivalents balance at the time of the closing of the Transactions is greater than $480.0 million,
such additional cash and cash equivalents will be used to fund the Transactions, and the cash
equity contribution described in footnote (6) below will be reduced by the difference between the
cash balance at closing used to fund the Transactions and $480.0 million. To the extent that our
cash and cash equivalents balance at the time of the closing of the Transactions is less than
$480.0 million, the cash equity contribution described in footnote (6) below will be increased by
the difference between the cash balance at closing used to fund the Transactions and
$480.0 million. The statements in this footnote regarding our expected cash and cash equivalents
balance at the closing of the Transactions (i) do not include any impact due to our outstanding
foreign currency exchange derivative financial instruments, including any impact attributable to
any termination thereof, which amounts could be material, (ii) assume that all of the outstanding
shares will receive the Acquisition Consideration and (iii) do not adjust for any potential liabilities
resulting from any appraisal rights proceedings.
(2) As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under
2021 Senior Notes and $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2023
Senior Notes. The amounts shown exclude any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any
unamortized net premiums, and the “As Adjusted” amount shown assumes all of the Existing

Notes are tendered in connection with the Tender Offers. As of February 29, 2016, 99.96% of the
2021 Senior Notes and 99.96% of the 2023 Senior Notes have been tendered. The 2021 Senior
Notes bear interest at 6.000% per annum and are scheduled to mature on June 15, 2021, and
the 2023 Senior Notes bear interest at 6.125% per annum and are scheduled to mature on
November 1, 2023. See “The Transactions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—PreTransactions.”
(3) In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into the New Revolving Facility, which we
expect will provide for a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $300.0 million.
As of December 31, 2015, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our
unused availability under our New Revolving Facility would have been approximately
$300.0 million. We do not expect to borrow under the New Revolving Facility in connection with
the Transactions. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities.”
(4) In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into the New Term Loan Facility, which we
expect will provide for a seven-year senior secured term loan of $2,200.0 million, including a U.S.
dollar tranche and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of a euro tranche.
The amount shown excludes any original issue discount. Any original issue discount will be
amortized and included as interest expense in our statement of income and comprehensive
income over the life of the term loans. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities.”
(5) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the notes offered hereby.
(6) Represents the approximate cash preferred equity contribution to be made to Parent by BSPI and
KSISH (all of the preferred equity financing provided to Parent will be contributed to the Issuer as
common equity) and the approximate cash common equity contribution to be made by VEPFV
and certain other investors arranged and/or designated by Vista. The cash common equity
contribution is expected to be reduced by approximately $278.0 million, the Appraisal Demand
Amount, which is not expected to be funded by Common Equity Investors at the closing of the
Merger. The total equity and total capitalization will be reduced by the aggregate amount the
Common Equity Investors elect not to fund. Approximately $121.3 million related to demands for
appraisal will be funded at the closing of the Merger.
(7) Excludes redeemable noncontrolling interests of $80.8 million as of December 31, 2015, which
represents certain ownership interests in two of our majority-owned consolidated subsidiaries
held by noncontrolling owners that are considered redeemable outside of our control, and
noncontrolling interests of $11.6 million as of December 31, 2015, which represents the
noncontrolling interests in several other majority-owned consolidated subsidiaries. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition—Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates.”

**UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The following unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements have been
developed by applying pro forma adjustments to our historical audited consolidated financial
statements and our historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, each included
elsewhere in this offering circular. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statements of
income (loss) give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as if they had occurred on
July 1, 2014 and the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma balance sheet gives pro forma
effect to the consummation of the Transactions as if they had occurred on December 31, 2015. The
unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2015 has been derived by adding the financial data from our condensed consolidated
pro forma statement of income (loss) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 to the financial data from
our unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) for the six months ended
December 31, 2015 and subtracting the financial data from our unaudited condensed consolidated pro
forma statement of income (loss) for the six months ended December 31, 2014. The unaudited
condensed consolidated pro forma financial information for the twelve months ended December 31,
2015 has been included in this offering circular in order to provide investors with historical and pro
forma information for the latest practicable twelve-month period. The adjustments are limited to
amounts that are directly attributable to the Transactions, factually supportable, and with respect to the
condensed consolidated pro forma statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact.

The unaudited pro forma adjustments reflected herein are preliminary and based upon available
information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The
unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial data is presented for informational purposes
only. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial data does not purport to represent
what our results of operations or financial condition would have been had the Transactions actually
occurred on the dates indicated, nor do they purport to project our results of operations or financial
condition for any future period or as of any future date. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro
forma financial data should be read in conjunction with the information included under “The
Transactions,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Selected Consolidated Historical Financial Data,” “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our audited and
unaudited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this offering circular. All pro
forma adjustments and their underlying assumptions are described more fully in the notes to our
unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements.

The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of
accounting under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic No. 805, Business
_Combinations, under GAAP. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated purchase_
price of an acquisition is allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated
fair values. Such valuations are based on available information and certain assumptions that we
believe are reasonable. Management, with the assistance of an independent third party, has made a
preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed based on various preliminary estimates. The actual adjustments to our
consolidated financial statements upon the closing of the Merger will depend on a number of factors,
including additional information available and our net assets on the closing date of the Merger. In
addition, this pro forma presentation does not contemplate changes in tax structure, accounting
policies or synergy benefits. We have also assumed for purposes of this presentation that all
outstanding shares will receive the Acquisition Consideration and have not made any adjustments in
connection with liabilities (including any interest expense related thereto) that may result from any
appraisal rights proceedings. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma
adjustments, and the differences may be material. For example, as of February 26, 2016, Solera has

65


-----

received purported demands for appraisal with respect to approximately 7,149,364 shares of Solera
common stock. Based on this number of shares, the amount of financing necessary to consummate
the Merger at the closing is expected to be reduced by approximately $278.0 million. Approximately
$121.3 million related to demands for appraisal will be funded at the closing of the Merger. Parent
expects to permit the Common Equity Investors, at their option, and on a pro rata basis, to reduce the
amount of the common equity contribution to be funded by each of them in cash in connection with the
closing in an aggregate amount up to the Appraisal Demand Amount, and the common equity
contribution and total stockholders’ equity will be reduced by the aggregate amount that is not funded.

The final purchase price allocation is dependent on, among other things, the finalization of asset
and liability valuations. As of the date of this offering circular, we have not completed the valuation
studies necessary to finalize the estimates of the fair values of the assets we have acquired and
liabilities we have assumed and the related allocation of purchase price. We have allocated the total
estimated purchase price, calculated as described in note 1 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
pro forma financial statements, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on preliminary
estimates of their fair values. A final determination of these fair values will reflect our consideration of a
final valuation prepared by third-party appraisers. This final valuation will be based on the actual net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets that existed as of the closing date of the Merger. Any final
adjustment will change the allocations of purchase price, which could affect the fair value assigned to
the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited condensed consolidated pro
forma financial statements, including a change to goodwill and a change to the amortization of tangible
and identifiable intangible assets. Any such changes could differ materially from the valuations and
purchase price allocations presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated pro
forma financial statements.

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1. Basis of Presentation**

The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements have been developed by
applying pro forma adjustments to our historical audited and unaudited consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this offering circular. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro
forma statements of income (loss) give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as if
they had occurred on July 1, 2014 and the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma balance sheet
gives pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as if they had occurred on
December 31, 2015. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2015 has been derived by adding the financial data from our
condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015
to the financial data from our unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss)
for the six months ended December 31, 2015 and subtracting the financial data from our unaudited
condensed consolidated pro forma statement of income (loss) for the six months ended December 31,
2014. The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial information for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2015 has been included in this offering circular in order to provide investors with
historical and pro forma information for the latest practicable twelve-month period. The adjustments are
limited to amounts that are directly attributable to the Transactions, factually supportable, and with
respect to the condensed consolidated pro forma statements of income, expected to have a continuing
impact.

At the Effective Time, each share of Solera common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any such shares (x) that are owned by Parent, Merger Sub or
any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or owned by Solera or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Solera, in each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (y) that
are held by stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights with respect to
such shares) will be converted into the right to receive an amount equal to $55.85 in cash, without
interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. All outstanding vested and unvested stock options,
all unvested restricted stock units, and vested, unvested and earned performance share units will be
settled for an aggregate amount of approximately $36.0 million in accordance with the Merger
Agreement. For purposes of the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements, we
have assumed that all of the outstanding shares will receive an amount equal to $55.85 in cash (the
“Acquisition Consideration”) and have not made any adjustments with any possible appraisal right. The
total purchase consideration paid in connection with the Merger is estimated to be $3.85 billion.

The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of
accounting under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 805, Business Combinations, under GAAP. Under
the acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price of an acquisition is allocated
to the net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations are
based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Management,
with the assistance of an independent third party, has made a preliminary allocation of the estimated
purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on various
preliminary estimates. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon the
closing of the Merger will depend on a number of factors, including additional information available and
our net assets on the closing date of the Merger. In addition, this pro forma presentation does not
contemplate changes in tax structure, accounting policies or synergy benefits. We have also assumed
for purposes of this presentation that all outstanding shares will receive the Acquisition Consideration
and have not made any adjustments in connection with liabilities (including any interest expense
related thereto) that may result from any appraisal rights proceedings. Therefore, the actual
adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material.

72


-----

The final purchase price allocation is dependent on, among other things, the finalization of asset
and liability valuations. As of the date of this offering circular, we have not completed the valuation
studies necessary to finalize the estimates of the fair values of the assets we have acquired and
liabilities we have assumed and the related allocation of purchase price. We have allocated the total
estimated purchase price, calculated as described in this note 1 to the unaudited condensed
consolidated pro forma financial statements, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
preliminary estimates of their fair values. A final determination of these fair values will reflect our
consideration of a final valuation prepared by third-party appraisers. This final valuation will be based
on the actual net tangible and identifiable intangible assets that existed as of the closing date of the
Merger. Any final adjustment will change the allocations of purchase price, which could affect the fair
value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited condensed
consolidated pro forma financial statements, including a change to goodwill and a change to the
amortization of tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Any such changes could differ materially
from the valuations and purchase price allocations presented in the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements.

The following table sets forth the preliminary allocation of the purchase price as reflected in the
unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma balance sheet as of December 31, 2015:

**2. Sources and Uses of Funds**

The following table summarizes the estimated sources and uses of proceeds in connection with
the Transactions, assuming the Transactions occurred on December 31, 2015. The actual amounts set
forth in the table and in the accompanying footnotes are subject to adjustment and may differ at the
time of the consummation of the Transactions depending on several factors, including differences from
our estimation of fees and expenses. Amounts are presented in thousands.

(i) In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into the New Revolving Facility, which we
expect will provide for a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $300.0 million.
As of December 31, 2015, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our
unused availability under our New Revolving Facility would have been approximately
$300.0 million. We do not expect to borrow under the New Revolving Facility in connection with
the Transactions.
(ii) In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into the New Term Loan Facility, which we
expect will provide for a seven-year senior secured term loan of $2,200.0 million, including a U.S.
dollar tranche and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of a euro tranche.
The amount shown excludes any original issue discount. Any original issue discount will be
amortized and included as interest expense in our statement of income and comprehensive
income over the life of the term loans.
(iii) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the notes offered hereby.
(iv) Represents the approximate cash preferred equity contribution to be made to Parent by BSPI and
KSISH (all of the preferred equity financing provided to Parent will be contributed to the Issuer as
common equity).
(v) Represents the approximate cash common equity contribution to be made by VEPFV and certain
other investors arranged and/or designated by Vista. The cash common equity contribution is
expected to be reduced by approximately $278.0 million, the Appraisal Demand Amount, which is
not expected to be funded by Common Equity Investors at the closing of the Merger. The cash
common equity contribution will be reduced by the aggregate amount the Common Equity
Investors elect not to fund. Approximately $121.3 million related to demands for appraisal will be
funded at the closing of the Merger.
(vi) Reflects our estimate of the total consideration to be paid to holders of all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Solera common stock that are entitled to receive the Acquisition
Consideration and the settlement of vested and unvested stock options, restricted stock, restricted
stock units and performance stock units in the Merger, net of $358.2 million of cash from the
balance sheet. This amount assumes that all of the outstanding shares will receive the Acquisition
Consideration, and we have not made any adjustments for any potential liabilities resulting from any
appraisal rights proceedings. Amounts not paid at the closing of the Transactions as a result of
appraisal rights may be used by us for other general purposes. See note 1 above.

74


-----

As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of $470.5 million in cash and cash equivalents
without giving effect to the Transactions. We expect that at the time of the closing of the
Transactions (prior to giving effect to the Transactions), our cash and cash equivalents will be
approximately $480.0 million and that approximately $391.0 million of the cash and cash
equivalents balance at closing will be used to fund the Transactions, with $210.3 million (includes
$121.3 million relating to demands for appraisal that will be funded at closing) of the remainder
available as cash for working capital to fund operations. To the extent that our cash and cash
equivalents balance at the time of the closing of the Transactions is greater than $480.0 million,
such additional cash and cash equivalents will be used to fund the Transactions, and the cash
equity contribution described in footnote (v) above will be reduced by the difference between the
cash balance at closing used to fund the Transactions and $480.0 million. To the extent that our
cash and cash equivalents balance at the time of the closing of the Transactions is less than
$480.0 million, the cash equity contribution described in footnote (v) above will be increased by
the difference between the cash balance at closing used to fund the Transactions and
$480.0 million. The statements in this footnote regarding our expected cash and cash equivalents
balance at the closing of the Transactions do not include any impact due to our outstanding
foreign currency exchange derivative financial instruments, including any impact attributable to
any termination thereof, which amounts could be material.
(vii) As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under the
2021 Senior Notes and $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2023
Senior Notes. This amount assumes all of the Existing Notes are tendered in connection with the
Tender Offers and excludes any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any unamortized net
premium. As of February 29, 2016, 99.96% of the 2021 Senior Notes and 99.96% of the 2023
Senior Notes have been tendered. The 2021 Senior Notes bear interest at 6.000% per annum
and are scheduled to mature on June 15, 2021, and the 2023 Senior Notes bear interest at
6.125% per annum and are scheduled to mature on November 1, 2023.
(viii) Reflects our estimate of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including early
tender participation premiums and accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes, original
issue discount, placement fees, initial purchaser discounts, underwriting and other financing fees,
advisory fees and other transaction costs and professional fees. The amount included on account
of accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes is through December 31, 2015. We estimate
the additional accrued interest on the Existing Notes through the expected closing date will be
approximately $32.8 million. To the extent any financing fees, accrued and unpaid interest on the
Existing Notes, original issue discount and other fees and expenses exceed the estimated
amounts, we expect to fund such amounts with cash on our balance sheet at the closing of the
Transactions.

**3. Pro Forma Adjustments**

(A) Represents the net cash on hand used to fund the Transactions discussed in note 2 above.

(B) Represents the elimination of historical goodwill and the recognition of the excess purchase
price over tangible and intangible net assets acquired as the new basis in goodwill as
determined in the preliminary purchase price allocation discussed in note 1 above.

75


-----

(C) Represents the elimination of the historical net book value of identifiable intangible assets
and the recognition of the estimated fair value of the acquired identified intangible assets.
The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the acquired identified intangible
assets and their respective amortizable lives:

**Amount** **Amortizable Lives**

**(in thousands)** **(in years)**

(D) Reflects the elimination of $12.9 million of unamortized deferred issuance costs related to
the Existing Notes that will be repurchased in connection with the Transactions, offset by
$120.6 million of estimated costs resulting from the issuance of the notes offered hereby
and the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

(E) Reflects the payment of accrued interest on the Existing Notes that will be repurchased in
connection with the Transactions.

Total pro forma adjustments related to long-term
debt. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 630,116

(G) Represents the estimated deferred income tax liability resulting from the fair value
adjustment for identifiable acquired intangible assets. We calculated the deferred income
tax liability based on the excess book basis over the tax basis of the identifiable intangible
assets and applying a blended income tax rate that considers the expected jurisdiction to
which the identifiable intangible assets acquired relate. The estimated deferred income tax
liability is preliminary and is subject to change based upon management’s final
determination of the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired by jurisdiction.

(H) Represents adjustments to eliminate historical common shares and accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and to record the purchase consideration paid by the new
investors.

(i) For purposes of the condensed consolidated pro forma statements of income, we have
not shown the charge associated with expensing of professional fees related to the
Merger as this impact is non-recurring.

77


-----

(M) Reflects the elimination of historical debt extinguishment costs.

(N) Reflects the estimated income tax expense and deferred taxes related to the adjustments
reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements. Tax
expense for the pro forma debt adjustments was calculated under the assumption that all
new debt will be issued in the United States and subjected to U.S. federal and state income
taxes. As such, a federal plus blended state tax rate was utilized.

We computed a deferred tax liability of $491 million based on the preliminary step up value
that was allocated to identifiable intangibles. This deferred tax liability was computed
utilizing a blended tax rate because we operate in multiple jurisdictions.

We continue to evaluate and quantify our valuation allowance position and our permanent
reinvestment assertion on both historical earnings and the additional outside basis
difference created as a result of the fair value adjustments.

(a) Restructuring charges, asset impairments and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities
primarily represent costs incurred in relation to our restructuring initiatives. Restructuring charges

contract liabilities that we do not expect to provide future economic benefits due to the implementation
of our restructuring initiatives.

professional fees and personnel retention incentives; legal and other professional fees and other
transaction costs associated with completed and contemplated business combinations and asset
acquisitions, costs associated with integrating acquired businesses, including costs incurred to

eliminate workforce redundancies and for product rebranding, and other charges incurred as a direct
result of our acquisition efforts. These other charges include changes to the fair value of contingent
purchase consideration, acquired assets and assumed liabilities subsequent to the completion of the
purchase price allocation, purchase consideration that is deemed to be compensatory in nature, and
incentive compensation arrangements with continuing employees of acquired companies.
(c) Other (income) expense, net consists of foreign exchange gains and losses on notes receivable and
notes payable to affiliates, realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial
instruments, investment income and other miscellaneous income and expense.
(10) For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of earnings before
provision for income taxes plus fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest expensed and capitalized,
amortized premiums, discounts and capitalized expenses related to indebtedness and an estimate of the
interest within rental expense. Changes in the ratio of earnings to fixed charges are primarily due to an
increase in interest expense associated with the issuance of additional Existing Notes.
(11) We define working capital as current assets less current liabilities.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND**
**RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

_The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations covers_
_periods prior to the consummation of the Transactions. Accordingly, the discussion and analysis of_
_historical periods does not reflect the significant impact that the Transactions will have on our financial_
_position, results of operations and cash flows, including, without limitation, increased leverage and_
_related interest expense, the impact of acquisition accounting (including changes in amortization_
_expenses) and debt service requirements. You should read the following discussion and analysis in_
_conjunction with “Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Pro Forma Financial Information,” “Selected_
_Consolidated Historical Financial Data,” and the historical financial statements and related notes_
_included elsewhere in this offering circular. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking_
_statements regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and_
_capital resources and other non-historical statements that are based on management’s current_
_expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may_
_differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. These forward-_
_looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the_
_risks and uncertainties described in the “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-_
_Looking Statements” sections of this offering circular._

_All percentage amounts and ratios were calculated using the underlying data in whole dollars and_
_may reflect rounding adjustments. Operating results for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 and the six_
_months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be_
_expected for any future period. We describe the effects on our results that are attributed to changes in_
_foreign currency exchange rates as constant currency which we measure by converting the current_
_period results into U.S. dollars at the average rates in effect for the same period from the prior year._

_Our fiscal year ends on June 30 of each year. Fiscal years are identified in this offering circular_
_according to the calendar year in which they end. For example, the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 is_
_referred to as “fiscal year 2015.” Unless otherwise specified, all references in this offering circular to_
_years are to fiscal years._

**Overview**

We are a leading provider of risk and asset management software and services to the automotive
and property marketplace, including the global property and casualty insurance industry. We are
expanding beyond our global-leading position in collision repair and U.S.-based mechanical repair
presence to bring data driven productivity and decision support solutions to other aspects of vehicle
ownership such as parts procurement, vehicle re-insurance underwriting, driver violation monitoring,
electronic titling, vehicle validation, CRM-SMR solutions, vehicle valuation and digital content
applications. We are also taking our core competencies of data, software and connectivity from the
auto to the home.

We help our customers:

‰ estimate the costs to repair damaged vehicles and determine pre-collision fair market values
for damaged vehicles for which the repair costs exceed the vehicles’ value;

‰ automate and outsource steps of the claims process that insurance companies have historically
performed internally;

‰ diagnose and repair vehicle mechanical problems; and

‰ improve their ability to monitor and manage their businesses through data reporting and
analysis.

-----

We serve approximately 195,000 customers and are active in over 75 countries across six
continents with approximately 5,400 employees. Our customers include more than 4,000 automobile
insurance companies, 60,500 collision repair facilities, 12,600 independent assessors, 49,000 service,
maintenance and repair facilities and 68,400 automotive recyclers, auto dealers and others. We derive
revenues from many of the world’s largest automobile insurance companies, including the ten largest
automobile insurance companies in Europe and eight of the ten largest automobile insurance
companies in North America.

At the core of our software and services are our proprietary databases, which are localized to
each geographical market we serve. Our insurance claims processing software and services are
typically integrated into our customers’ systems, operations and processes, making it costly and time
consuming to switch to another provider. This customer integration, along with our products and longstanding customer relationships, has contributed to our very high customer retention rate.

**Segments**

We have aggregated our operating segments into two reportable segments: EMEA and
Americas. Our EMEA reportable segment encompasses our operations in Europe, the Middle East,
Africa, Asia and Australia, while our Americas reportable segment encompasses our operations in
North, Central and South America.

Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. We evaluate the performance
of our reportable segments based on revenues, income before provision for income taxes and adjusted
EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that represents U.S. GAAP net income (loss) excluding
interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based
compensation expense, restructuring charges, asset impairments and other costs associated with exit
and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, litigation related expenses and other (income)
expense, net. We do not allocate certain costs to reportable segments, including costs related to our
financing activities, business development and oversight, and tax, audit and other professional fees, to
our reportable segments. Instead, we manage these costs at the Corporate level.

The table below sets forth our revenues by reportable segment and as a percentage of our total
revenues for the periods indicated:

than 10% of total revenues.

**The Transactions**

**_Merger_**

On September 13, 2015, Solera entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Solera, with Solera surviving
the Merger as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent and Merger Sub are beneficially
owned by VEPFV, and Parent, Merger Sub and VEPFV are affiliated with Vista. At the Effective Time,
each share of Solera common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any such shares (x) that are owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or owned by Solera or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Solera, in each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (y) that are held by
stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights with respect to such shares)
will be converted into the right to receive an amount equal to $55.85 in cash, without interest and less
any applicable withholding taxes.

We expect to finance the Merger, the Refinancing and pay the fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions with proceeds from the Financing Transactions described below. For
a more complete description of the Transactions, see “The Transactions,” “Use of Proceeds,”
“Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes.”

The Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by Solera’s
stockholders and receipt of certain approvals by antitrust and competition authorities of various
jurisdictions. On October 9, 2015, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act, and on December 3, 2015, the European Commission approved the
Merger under the EU Merger Regulation. On December 8, 2015, Solera’s stockholders voted to adopt
the Merger Agreement. The closing of the Merger remains subject to certain other customary closing
conditions.

Solera has made customary representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and has
agreed to customary covenants regarding the operation of the business of Solera and its subsidiaries
prior to the consummation of the Merger. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for
Parent and Solera, including the right of each party to terminate the Merger Agreement if, other than in
certain circumstances described therein, the Merger is not consummated by March 15, 2016. The
completion of the Merger is currently expected to occur concurrently with the consummation of this
offering.

**_The Financing Transactions_**

In connection with the consummation of the Merger, we anticipate entering into the following
Financing Transactions:

‰ the contribution of common equity financing in an aggregate amount of up to $1.2 billion to be
provided to Parent by VEPFV, or other parties to whom it assigns a portion of its commitment;

‰ the contribution of common and preferred equity financing in an aggregate amount of up to
$1.3 billion to be provided to Parent by KSISH, or other parties to whom KSISH assigns a
portion of its commitment or with whom Vista arranges for alternative equity financing to
replace all or a portion of KSISH’s commitment (all of the preferred equity financing provided to
Parent will be contributed to the Issuer as common equity);

‰ the contribution of preferred equity financing in an aggregate amount of up to $800.0 million to
be provided to Parent by BSPI and KSISH, or other parties to whom they assign a portion of
their respective commitments (all of the preferred equity financing provided to Parent will be
contributed to the Issuer as common equity);

85


-----

‰ the borrowing of approximately $2,200.0 million under the New Term Loan Facility, including a
U.S. dollar tranche and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of a euro
tranche;
‰ the entry into a $300.0 million New Revolving Facility, under which we do not anticipate having
any outstanding borrowings upon the consummation of the Merger; and
‰ the issuance of $1,730.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes offered hereby.

See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Series A Preferred Stock” and “—
Series B Preferred Stock” for a description of the terms of the preferred equity financing and see
“Description of Other Indebtedness—New Senior Secured Credit Facilities” for a description of the
terms of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

As of February 26, 2016, Solera has received purported demands for appraisal with respect to
approximately 7,149,364 shares of Solera common stock (representing approximately $399.3 million if
appraisal has been properly demanded with respect to all of the approximately 7,149,364 shares for
which appraisal demands have purported to have been delivered as of February 26, 2016). Based on
this number of shares, the amount of financing necessary to consummate the Merger at the closing is
expected to be reduced by approximately $278.0 million. Approximately $121.3 million related to
demands for appraisal, will be funded at the closing of the Merger. Parent expects to permit the
Common Equity Investors, at their option, and on a pro rata basis, to reduce the amount of the
common equity contribution to be funded by each of them in cash in connection with the closing in an
aggregate amount up to the Appraisal Demand Amount, and the common equity contribution and total
stockholders’ equity will be reduced by the aggregate amount that is not funded. To the extent cash is
needed in the future to pay for the shares of Solera common stock with respect to which appraisal
rights have been exercised, the Common Equity Investors will remain committed to fund up to the
Appraisal Demand Amount (or such lesser amount not funded in connection with the closing of the
Merger) pursuant to contractual arrangements with Parent.

**_The Tender Offers, Consent Solicitations and the Change of Control Offers_**
On November 6, 2015, Audatex commenced the Tender Offers for any and all of its Existing
Notes. In conjunction with the Tender Offers, Audatex solicited consents to amend certain provisions of
the indentures relating to the Existing Notes, including, but not limited to, amendments to eliminate or
modify substantially all of the restrictive covenants (including provisions relating to change of control
offers and limitations on secured indebtedness), certain requirements that must be satisfied in order for
Audatex to legally defease and discharge the Existing Notes, certain conditions governing the
revocation and effect of consents, certain reporting obligations, certain events of default and related
provisions. In order to adopt the Proposed Amendments, Audatex had to receive the Requisite
Consents. In order for the Proposed Amendments to become operative, Audatex must pay for validly
tendered Existing Notes. Concurrently on November 6, 2015, Audatex commenced the Change of
Control Offers for the Existing Notes.

As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 20, 2015, the initial early tender date for the
Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitations, $1,673,156,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2021
Senior Notes, representing 99.3% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior
Notes, were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, and $1,386,433,000 aggregate principal
amount of the 2023 Senior Notes, representing 98.0% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount
of the 2023 Senior Notes, were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn. On November 23, 2015,
Audatex extended the early tender date to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 6, 2016 and
extended the expiration date to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 13, 2016, unless further

Proposed Amendments, the Change of Control Offers were terminated on November 23, 2015. The
Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitations are contingent upon, among other things, the
simultaneous closing of the Merger.

On December 7, 2015, Audatex reopened withdrawal rights on a limited basis with respect to the
Existing Notes that had been validly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offers until the Withdrawal
Deadline. The withdrawal rights were limited to only permit the withdrawal of previously tendered notes
if and to the extent that at least a majority in principal amount of each series of the outstanding Existing
Notes remain tendered pursuant to the Tender Offers as of the Withdrawal Deadline. Holders were not
permitted to withdraw their consents tendered in connection with the Consent Solicitations. The
deadline for tendering the Existing Notes to be eligible for the early participation premium was 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on February 24, 2016. On February 29, 2016, Audatex further extended the
expiration date to 8:00 a.m., New York City time, on March 3, 2016, unless further extended or earlier
terminated. As of 8:00 a.m., New York City time, on February 29, 2016, $1,684,373,000 aggregate
principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes, representing 99.96% of the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of the 2021 Senior Notes, were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, and $1,414,500,000
aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Senior Notes, representing 99.96% of the outstanding
aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Senior Notes, were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn.

This offering circular is not an offer to purchase, or the solicitation of an offer to sell, the Existing
Notes. The Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations are made only by and pursuant to the terms of the
Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement dated November 6, 2015 and the related letter of
transmittal and consent, in each case as amended or supplemented.

**_Acquisition Accounting_**

Our financial statements in the future will vary from the historical financial statements included
elsewhere in this offering circular. The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination in
accordance with ASC Topic 805 and, accordingly, will result in the recognition of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at estimated fair values with the excess of the purchase price of the Merger
allocated to goodwill. As of the date of this offering circular, we have not completed the valuation
studies necessary to estimate the fair values of the assets we will acquire and the liabilities we will
assume necessary to reflect the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of such amounts. See
“Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Pro Forma Financial Information” for further discussion on the
assumptions and methods applied in arriving at the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma
financial statements presented herein.

As a consequence of the application of acquisition accounting, we may experience a higher level
of depreciation expense relating to our property and equipment, which will also impact our total cost of
sales, and we expect to incur a higher amortization expense relating to the expected increase in fair
values of our intangible assets with definite lives. Since the book value of certain inventories on the
closing of the Merger will also be increased to fair values, our gross profit will be lower for several
months following the closing of the Merger than it would be in the absence of acquisition accounting.

**Components of Revenues and Expenses**

**_Revenues_**

We generate revenues from the sale of software and services to our customers pursuant to
negotiated contracts or pricing agreements. Pricing for our software and services is set forth in these
agreements and negotiated with each customer. We generally bill our customers monthly under one or
more of the following bases:

‰ price per transaction;

‰ fixed monthly amount for a prescribed number of transactions;

‰ fixed monthly subscription rate;

‰ price per set of services rendered; and

‰ price per system delivered.

87


-----

Our software and services are often sold as packages, without individual pricing for each
component. Our revenues are reflected net of customer sales allowances, which we estimate based on
both our examination of a subset of customer accounts and historical experience.

Our core offering is our estimating and workflow software, which is used by our insurance
company, collision repair facility and independent assessor customers, representing the majority of our
revenues. We also derive revenues from our salvage and recycling software, business intelligence and
consulting services, vehicle data validation, salvage disposition, driver violation reporting services,
service, maintenance and repair solutions and other offerings.

**_Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation and amortization)_**

Our costs and expenses applicable to revenues represent the total of operating expenses and
systems development and programming costs, which are discussed below.

**_Operating expenses_**

Our operating expenses primarily include: compensation and benefit costs for our operations,
database development and customer service personnel; other costs related to operations, database
development and customer support functions; third-party data and royalty costs; costs related to
computer software and hardware used in the delivery of our software and services; and the costs of
purchased data from state departments of motor vehicles.

**_Systems development and programming costs_**

Systems development and programming costs primarily include: compensation and benefit costs
for our product development and product management personnel; other costs related to our product

involved in systems development and programming activities.

**_Selling, general and administrative expenses_**

Our selling, general and administrative expenses primarily include: compensation and benefit
costs for our sales, marketing, administration and corporate personnel; costs related to our facilities;
and professional and legal fees.

We also include share-based compensation expense in our selling, general and administrative
expenses, which represents the recognition of the grant-date fair value of stock awards granted to
employees, officers, members of our board of directors and others pursuant to our equity
compensation plans. We recognize the grant date fair value as share-based compensation expense
over the requisite service period.

**_Depreciation and amortization_**

Depreciation includes depreciation attributable to buildings, leasehold improvements, data
processing and computer equipment, purchased software, and furniture and fixtures. Amortization
includes amortization attributable to software developed or obtained for internal use and intangible
assets acquired in business combinations, particularly our acquisitions of Explore, SRS, I&S and CAP.

**_Restructuring charges, asset impairments and other costs associated with exit and disposal_**
**_activities_**

Restructuring charges, asset impairments and other costs associated with exit and disposal
activities primarily represent costs incurred in relation to our restructuring initiatives. Restructuring

88


-----

charges primarily include employee termination benefits charges and charges related to the lease and
vendor contract liabilities that we do not expect to provide future economic benefits due to the
implementation of our restructuring initiatives.

**_Acquisition and related costs_**

Acquisition and related costs include costs incurred in relation to the proposed acquisition of
Solera by Vista, including professional fees and personnel retention incentives; legal and professional
fees and other transaction costs associated with completed and contemplated business combinations
and asset acquisitions; costs associated with integrating acquired businesses, including costs incurred
to eliminate workforce redundancies and for product rebranding; and other charges incurred as a direct
result of our acquisition efforts. These other charges include changes to the fair value of contingent
purchase consideration, acquired assets and assumed liabilities subsequent to the completion of the
purchase price allocation, purchase price that is deemed to be compensatory in nature and incentive
compensation arrangements with continuing employees of acquired companies.

**_Interest expense_**

Interest expense consists primarily of interest on our debt and amortization of related debt
issuance costs, net of premium and discount amortization.

**_Other (income) expense, net_**

Other (income) expense, net consists of foreign exchange gains and losses on notes receivable
and notes payable to affiliates, realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments,
investment income and other miscellaneous income and expense.

**_Income tax provision_**

Income taxes have been provided for all items included in the statements of income included
herein, regardless of when such items were reported for tax purposes or when the taxes were actually
paid or refunded.

**_Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests_**

Several of our customers and other entities own noncontrolling interests in certain of our
operating subsidiaries. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflect such owners’
proportionate interest in the earnings of such operating subsidiaries.

**Factors Affecting Our Operating Results**

Below is a summary description of several external factors that have or may have an effect on
our operating results.

**_Foreign currency._** During fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 and the six months ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014, we generated approximately 56%, 63%, 68%, 50% and 57% of our
revenues, respectively, and incurred a majority of our costs, in currencies other than the U.S. dollar,
primarily the Euro. We translate our local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on average
exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period for our consolidated statement of income and
certain components of stockholders’ equity and the exchange rate at the end of that period for the
consolidated balance sheet. These translations resulted in foreign currency translation adjustments of
$(167.7) million, $39.1 million, $8.4 million, $24.1 million and $99.1 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014

89


-----

and 2013 and the six months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are recorded
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Foreign
currency transaction gains (losses) recognized in our consolidated statements of income (loss) were
$(50.5) million, $11.0 million, $(5.5) million, $(9.3) million and $(8.7) million during fiscal years 2015,
2014, and 2013 and the six months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Exchange rates between most of the major foreign currencies we use to transact our business
and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and we expect that they will
continue to fluctuate during fiscal year 2016. The majority of our revenues and costs are denominated
in Euros, Pound Sterling, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars and other foreign currencies. The following
table provides the average quarterly exchange rates for the Euro and Pound Sterling since the
beginning of fiscal year 2015:


**Average Pound**
**Sterling-to-U.S.**
**Dollar Exchange**
**Rate**


**Period**


**Average Euro-to-**
**U.S. Dollar**
**Exchange Rate**


Quarter Ended September 30, 2014. . . . $1.33 $1.67
Quarter Ended December 31, 2014 . . . . $1.25 $1.58
Quarter Ended March 31, 2015 . . . . . . . . $1.13 $1.52
Quarter Ended June 30, 2015 . . . . . . . . . $1.11 $1.53
Quarter Ended September 30, 2015. . . . $1.11 $1.55
Quarter Ended December 31, 2015 . . . . $1.10 $1.52

During fiscal year 2015, as compared to fiscal year 2014, the U.S. dollar strengthened against
most major foreign currencies we use to transact our business. The average U.S. dollar strengthened
versus the Euro by 11.4% and the Pound Sterling by 3.2%, which decreased our revenues and
expenses during fiscal year 2015. A hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in the U.S. dollar versus
other currencies in which we transact our business would have resulted in an increase or decrease, as
the case may be, to our revenues of $31.7 million during fiscal year 2015.

During the six months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the six months ended
December 31, 2014, the U.S. dollar strengthened against most major foreign currencies we use to
transact our business. The average U.S. dollar strengthened versus the Euro by 14.3% and the
Pound Sterling by 5.7%, which decreased our revenues and expenses for the six months ended
December 31, 2015. A hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in the U.S. dollar versus other currencies
in which we transact our business would have resulted in an increase or decrease, as the case may
be, to our revenues of $15.5 million during the six months ended December 31, 2015.

**_Factors that affect business volume._** The following external factors have or may have an
effect on the number of claims that are submitted and/or our volume of transactions, any of which can
affect our revenues:

‰ Number of insurance claims made. In fiscal year 2015, the number of insurance claims
made increased slightly versus fiscal year 2014. In several of our large western European
markets, the number of insurance claims for vehicle damage submitted by owners to their
insurance carriers declined slightly. The number of insurance claims made can be influenced
by factors such as unemployment levels, the number of miles driven, rising gasoline prices, the
number of uninsured drivers, rising insurance premiums and insured opting for lower coverage
or higher deductible levels, among other things. Fewer claims made can reduce the
transaction-based fees that we generate.

‰ Sales of new and used vehicles. According to industry sources, global new light vehicle
sales grew by 3.6% in 2014 to 86.3 million units and sales are forecasted to reach 88.4 million

90


-----

units, up by 2.4%, in 2015. In Advanced Markets, sales are projected to grow at a 0.7% CAGR
from 2014 through 2024. In other markets, sales are projected to grow at a 6.6% CAGR from
2014 through 2024. Fewer new light vehicle sales can result in fewer insured vehicles on the
road and fewer automobile accidents, which can reduce the transaction-based fees that we
generate.

‰ Damaged vehicle repair costs. The cost to repair damaged vehicles, also known as
severity, includes labor, parts and other related costs. Severity has steadily risen for a number
of years. According to industry sources, from 2001 through 2010, the price index for body work
has increased by 30.5% compared with a 23.2% increase in the general cost of living index.
Insurance companies purchase our products and services to help standardize the cost of
repair. Should the cost of labor, parts and other related items continue to increase over
time, insurance companies may seek to purchase and utilize an increasing number of our
products and services to help improve the standardization of the cost of repair.

‰ Penetration Rate of Vehicle Insurance. An increasing rate of procuring vehicle insurance
will result in an increase in the number of insurance claims made for damaged vehicles. An
increasing number of insurance claims submitted can increase the transaction-based fees that
we generate for partial-loss and total-loss estimates. This is due in part to both increased
regulation and increased use of financing in the purchase of new and used vehicles. We expect
that the rate of vehicle insurance in our less mature international markets will continue to
increase during the next eighteen months.

‰ Automobile Usage-Number of Miles Driven. Several factors can influence miles driven,
including gasoline prices and economic conditions. According to industry sources, for calendar
year 2014, cumulative miles driven in the United States increased by 2.6% compared to the
same period in the prior year. For calendar year 2013, cumulative miles driven in the United
States remained flat compared to the same period in the prior year. Fewer miles driven can
result in fewer automobile accidents, which can reduce the transaction-based fees that we
generate.

‰ Seasonality. Our business is subject to seasonal and other fluctuations. In particular, we
have historically experienced higher revenues during the second quarter and third quarter
versus the first quarter and fourth quarter during each fiscal year. This seasonality is caused
primarily by more days of inclement weather during the second quarter and third quarter in
most of our markets, which contributes to a greater number of vehicle accidents and damage
during these periods. In addition, our business is subject to fluctuations caused by other
factors, including the occurrence of extraordinary weather events and the timing of certain
public holidays. For example, the Easter holiday occurs during the third quarter in certain fiscal
years and occurs during the fourth quarter in other fiscal years, resulting in a change in the
number of business days during the quarter in which the holiday occurs.

**_Share-based_** **_compensation_** **_expense._** We incurred pre-tax, non-cash share-based
compensation charges of $36.9 million, $37.5 million, $25.8 million, $14.2 million and $14.3 million
during fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 and for the six months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. We expect to recognize additional pre-tax, non-cash share-based compensation charges
related to share-based awards outstanding at December 31, 2015. The estimated total remaining
unamortized share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, was $29.2 million at December 31,
2015, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.

**_Restructuring charges._** We have incurred restructuring charges in each period presented and
also expect to incur additional restructuring charges, primarily relating to severance costs, over the
next several quarters as we work to improve efficiencies in our business. We do not expect reduced
revenues or an increase in other expenses as a result of continued implementation of our restructuring
initiatives.

91


-----

**_Other factors._** Other factors that have or may have an effect on our operating results include:

‰ gain and loss of customers;

‰ pricing pressures;

‰ acquisitions, joint ventures or similar transactions;

‰ expenses to develop new software or services; and

‰ expenses and restrictions related to indebtedness.

We do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our financial condition or results of
operations in recent years.

**Results of Operations**

Our results of operations include the results of operations of acquired companies from the date of
the respective acquisitions.

million, respectively. On a constant currency basis and excluding the incremental operating expense
contributions from CAP and other acquisitions, EMEA operating expenses increased $0.3 million, or
0.6%, during the six months ended December 31, 2015 resulting from the revenue growth during the
period.

Our Americas operating expenses increased $36.3 million or 39.4%, to $128.3 million and include
incremental operating expense contributions from I&S and other acquisitions of $3.2 million and $26.4
million, respectively. On a constant currency basis and excluding incremental operating expense
contributions from I&S and other acquisitions, Americas operating expenses increased $8.8 million, or
11.5%, during the six months ended December 31, 2015 resulting from the revenue growth during the
period.

**_Systems development and programming costs_**

During the six months ended December 31, 2015, SD&P increased $5.3 million, or 10.2%, to
$56.6 million and include incremental contributions from CAP and other acquisitions of $0.8 million and
$3.5 million, respectively. On a constant currency basis and excluding incremental SD&P contributions
from CAP and other acquisitions, SD&P increased $4.8 million, or 9.4%, during the six months ended
December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in SD&P expenses in both our Americas and EMEA
segments.

Our EMEA SD&P increased $3.7 million, or 13.6%, to $30.7 million and include incremental
SD&P contributions from CAP of $0.8 million. On a constant currency basis, and excluding the
incremental SD&P contributions from CAP, EMEA SD&P increased $5.8 million, or 21.5%, during the
six months ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increased investment in product development.

Our Americas SD&P increased $3.1 million, or 12.6%, to $27.4 million and include incremental
SD&P contributions from other acquisitions of $3.5 million. On a constant currency basis, and
excluding incremental SD&P contributions from other acquisitions, Americas SD&P increased by $0.4
million or 1.8% for the six months ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in personnel
expenses.

**_Selling, general and administrative expenses_**

During the six months ended December 31, 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses
(“SG&A”) increased $14.5 million, or 9.2%, to $171.9 million and include incremental SG&A
contributions from I&S, CAP, and other acquisitions of $0.3 million, $4.8 million, and $6.7 million,
respectively. On a constant currency basis and excluding incremental SG&A contributions from I&S,
CAP, and other acquisitions, SG&A increased $12.8 million, or 8.3%, primarily due to a one-time
special cash award of $10.0 million paid to our chief executive officer, Tony Aquila, in August 2015, an
increase in legal and other professional fees of $3.0 million, an increase in facilities and equipment
expenses of $1.8 million, and an increase in other administrative expenses of $0.8 million, partially
offset by a decrease in legal fees associated with the Mitchell patent infringement litigation of
$3.4 million.

**_Depreciation and amortization_**

During the six months ended December 31, 2015, depreciation and amortization increased by
$11.6 million, or 15.0%, to $89.0 million and includes incremental depreciation and amortization
contributions from I&S, CAP, and other acquisitions of $0.3 million, $7.8 million, and $6.2 million,
respectively. On a constant currency basis and excluding incremental depreciation and amortization
contributions from I&S, CAP, and other acquisitions, depreciation and amortization for the six months

95


-----

ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.9 million, or 1.3%, due to an increase in depreciation expense
resulting increased investment in data processing equipment to support ongoing growth.

We generally amortize intangible assets on an accelerated basis to reflect the pattern in which
the economic benefits of the intangible assets are realized.

**_Restructuring charges, asset impairments and other costs associated with exit and_**
**_disposal activities_**

During the six months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred restructuring charges,
asset impairments and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities of $4.6 million and $2.9
million, respectively.

The restructuring charges, asset impairments and other costs associated with exit and disposal
activities incurred during the six months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, consist
primarily of employee termination benefits related to ongoing restructuring initiatives.

**_Acquisition and related costs_**

We incurred acquisition and related costs of $43.0 million and $22.8 million, during the six months
ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Acquisition and related costs incurred during the six months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014
consist primarily of contingent purchase consideration that is deemed compensatory in nature and
other costs associated with completed acquisitions of $17.3 million and $14.5 million, respectively, and
legal and professional fees, incurred in relation to completed and contemplated business combinations
and asset acquisitions of $1.0 million and $8.3 million, respectively. Acquisition and related costs for
the six months ended December 31, 2015, also include $24.7 million of professional fees and other
costs incurred in relation to the pending acquisition of Solera by entities affiliated with Vista Equity
Partners.

**_Interest expense_**

During the six months ended December 31, 2015, interest expense increased $34.0 million due
to the interest expense resulting from the issuance of additional senior unsecured notes in November
2014 and July 2015.

We expect that our annual interest expense will increase in fiscal year 2016, as compared to
fiscal year 2015, as a result of the issuance of additional unsecured notes in November 2014 and July
2015.

**_Other expense, net_**

During the six months ended December 31, 2015, other expense, net increased $2.6 million due
primarily to a $2.3 million increase in net realized and unrealized losses on derivative financial
instruments during the six months ended December 31, 2015.

**_Income tax provision (benefit)_**

During the six months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded an income tax provision
(benefit) of $(21.9) million and $9.3 million, respectively. The decrease in the income tax provision is
primarily due to the U.S. tax benefit related to the increase in certain expenses during fiscal year 2015.

96


-----

For the six months ended December 31, 2015, the expected tax provision derived from applying the
U.S. federal statutory rate to our pre-tax income differed from our recorded income tax provision
primarily due to the amount of our pre-tax loss, relative to our income tax expense, nondeductible
expenses, and changes in tax law.

Our income tax provision for the six months ended December 31, 2015 is not necessarily
indicative of the effective tax rate that may be expected for fiscal year 2016.

Our tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate
of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the
relevant period. Our interim tax provision is subject to significant variation due to several factors,
including variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to
which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, foreign currency gains (losses),
changes in law, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized.
Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income
or loss.

Factors that impact our income tax provision include, but are not limited to, the mix of
jurisdictional earnings and varying jurisdictional income tax rates, establishment and release of
valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, permanent differences resulting from the book and tax
treatment of certain items, and discrete items. Future changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a
significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate.

As of each reporting date, management considers all evidence, both positive and negative, that
could impact our view with regards to future realization of deferred tax assets. As of December 31,
2015 and June 30, 2015, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax
assets $26.9 million due to the limitation in our ability to utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to
the expiration of the carryforward periods.

We are subject to periodic changes in the amount of our income tax provision and these changes
could adversely affect our operating results; we may not be able to utilize all of our tax benefits before
they expire.

Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by our mix of earnings in countries with high
versus low tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by a change
in our assertion that our foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested; by the outcomes of examinations,
audits or disputes by or with relevant tax authorities; or by changes in tax laws and regulations. There
have been several U.S. domestic and international laws which recently expired or were enacted that
could continue to have a material adverse impact on our tax expense.

Our ability to utilize certain U.S. tax deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient
taxable income before the expiration of the carryforward period. The decrease in our U.S. taxable
income, including recent increases in interest expense resulted in a decrease in the amount of U.S.
deferred tax assets considered realizable. Our projections of future taxable income required to fully
realize the recorded amount of the net deferred tax asset reflect numerous assumptions about our
operating business and investments, and are subject to change as conditions change specific to our
operating business, investments or general economic conditions. Adverse changes in certain
jurisdictions could result in the need to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in
a charge against earnings.

Significant judgment is required to apply the recognition and measurement criteria prescribed in
ASC Topic No. 740-10, Income Taxes. In addition, ASC Topic No. 740-10 applies to all income tax
positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which, if settled unfavorably, could

97


-----

adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. We record unrecognized
tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic No. 740 and adjust these liabilities when our
judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of
the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is
materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These
differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which
new information is available.

Primarily due to the increase in our U.S. debt service obligations resulting from the issuance of
additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million during fiscal year
2015 and the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$850.0 million in July 2015, management concluded that the ability to access certain amounts of
foreign earnings would provide greater flexibility to meet domestic cash flow needs without constraining
foreign objectives. Accordingly, in fiscal year 2015 we withdrew the permanent reinvestment assertion
on $350.0 million of earnings generated by certain of our foreign subsidiaries through fiscal year 2015.
We provided for U.S. income taxes on the $350.0 million of undistributed foreign earnings, resulting in
the recognition of a deferred tax liability of approximately $123.7 million. During the six months ended
December 31, 2015, we recognized a deferred income tax expense of $2.9 million related to the impact
of fluctuations in foreign currency exchanges rates on the portion of the $350.0 million of unremitted
earnings generated prior to fiscal year 2015.

We have not provided for U.S. federal or foreign income taxes, including withholding taxes, on the
remaining $840.7 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015.
We continue to assert that the $840.7 million of undistributed earnings is permanently reinvested in our
foreign operations and have no current plans to repatriate those earnings. If we were to distribute those
earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we could be subject to both U.S. income and foreign
taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. It is currently not practicable to
compute the residual taxes due on such earnings as we do not know the time or manner in which we
would distribute these earnings.

**_Operating expenses_**

_Fiscal Year 2015 vs. Fiscal Year 2014._ During fiscal year 2015, operating expenses increased
$63.4 million, or 28.5%, to $285.6 million, and include incremental operating expense contributions
from SRS, I&S and CAP of $14.4 million, $33.1 million and $3.6 million, respectively. On a constant
currency basis and excluding incremental operating expense contributions from SRS, I&S and CAP,
operating expenses increased $23.0 million, or 11.2%, during fiscal year 2015 primarily due to an
increase in operating expenses in our Americas segment.

Our EMEA operating expenses decreased $1.7 million, or 1.8%, to $95.2 million, and includes the
incremental operating expense contribution from CAP of $3.6 million. On a constant currency basis
and excluding the incremental operating expense contribution from CAP, EMEA operating expenses
increased $3.6 million, or 3.7%, during fiscal year 2015 primarily due to incremental operating expense
contributions from recently-acquired businesses other than CAP, mainly personnel related expenses.

Our Americas operating expenses increased $65.1 million, or 52.0%, to $190.5 million, and
include incremental operating expense contributions from SRS and I&S of $14.4 million and
$33.1 million, respectively. On a constant currency basis and excluding incremental operating expense
contributions from SRS and I&S, Americas operating expenses increased $19.4 million, or 17.8%,
during fiscal year 2015 primarily due to an increase in the costs of data purchased from state
departments of motor vehicles consistent with the revenue growth in our AudaExplore re-underwriting
business, increased personnel related expenses and incremental operating expense contributions from
recently-acquired businesses other than I&S, mainly personnel related expenses.

_Fiscal Year 2014 vs. Fiscal Year 2013._ During fiscal year 2014, operating expenses increased
$40.8 million, or 22.5%, to $222.3 million, and include incremental operating expense contributions
from SRS of $16.5 million. On a constant currency basis and excluding incremental operating expense
contributions of SRS, operating expenses increased $22.3 million, or 12.3% during fiscal year 2014
primarily due to an increase in operating expenses in our Americas segment.

Our EMEA operating expenses increased $12.2 million, or 14.3%, to $96.9 million. On a constant
currency basis EMEA operating expenses increased $8.9 million, or 10.5%, during fiscal year 2014
primarily due to incremental operating expense contributions from recently-acquired businesses,
mainly personnel related expenses.

Our Americas operating expenses increased $29.1 million or 30.3%, to $125.4 million, and
include incremental operating expense contributions from SRS of $16.5 million. On a constant currency
basis and excluding incremental operating expense contributions from SRS, Americas operating

expenses increased $13.8 million, or 14.3%, during fiscal year 2014 primarily due to an increase in the
costs of data purchased from state departments of motor vehicles consistent with the revenue growth
in our AudaExplore re-underwriting business, increased personnel related expenses and incremental
operating expense contributions from recently-acquired businesses other than SRS, mainly personnel
related expenses.

**_Systems development and programming costs_**

_Fiscal Year 2015 vs. Fiscal Year 2014._ During fiscal year 2015, SD&P increased $14.7 million,
or 16.2%, to $105.5 million and include incremental SD&P contributions from SRS, I&S, and CAP, of
$5.1 million, $0.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively. On a constant currency basis and excluding
incremental SD&P contributions from SRS, I&S, and CAP, SD&P increased $13.3 million, or 15.9%,
during fiscal year 2015 primarily due to an increase in SD&P expenses in our EMEA segment.

Our EMEA SD&P increased $8.1 million, or 16.6%, to $56.6 million and includes the incremental
SD&P contribution from CAP of $1.0 million. On a constant currency basis and excluding the
incremental SD&P contribution from CAP, EMEA SD&P increased $11.8 million, or 24.2%, during fiscal
year 2015 primarily due to increased personnel expenses and incremental SD&P expense
contributions from recently-acquired businesses other than CAP, mainly personnel related expenses.

Our Americas SD&P increased $6.7 million, or 15.8%, to $48.8 million, and includes incremental
SD&P contributions from SRS and I&S of $5.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively. On a constant
currency basis and excluding incremental SD&P contributions from SRS and I&S, Americas SD&P
increased $1.5 million, or 4.4%, during fiscal year 2015 primarily due to a decrease in internal software
development cost capitalizations.

_Fiscal Year 2014 vs. Fiscal Year 2013._ During fiscal year 2014, SD&P increased $11.7 million,
or 14.7%, to $90.7 million, and includes incremental SD&P contributions from SRS of $7.1 million. On
a constant currency basis and excluding incremental SD&P contributions from SRS, SD&P increased
$2.9 million, or 3.7%, during fiscal year 2014 primarily due to an increase in SD&P expenses in both
our Americas and EMEA segments.

Our EMEA SD&P increased $1.1 million, or 2.2%, to $48.5 million. On a constant currency basis
EMEA SD&P decreased $0.9 million, or 1.9%, during the fiscal year 2014 primarily due to increased
personnel expenses and external software development costs as we continue to invest in product
development and personnel related expenses.

Our Americas SD&P increased $10.6 million, or 33.6%, to $42.1 million and includes incremental
SD&P contributions from SRS of $7.1 million. On a constant currency basis and excluding incremental
SD&P contributions from SRS, Americas SD&P increased $3.8 million, or 12.1%, during fiscal year
2014 primarily due to increased personnel expenses and incremental SD&P contributions from
recently-acquired business other than SRS and I&S, mainly personnel related expenses.

**_Selling, general and administrative expenses_**

_Fiscal Year 2015 vs. Fiscal Year 2014._ During fiscal year 2015, SG&A increased $39.4 million
or 13.3% to 336.7 million and includes incremental SG&A contributions from SRS, I&S, and CAP of
$7.7 million, $4.7 million and $7.8 million, respectively. On a constant currency basis and excluding
incremental SG&A contributions from SRS, I&S, and CAP, SG&A increased $33.5 million, or 12.1%,
primarily due to a $15.0 million increase in personnel related expenses due to continued growth in our
business; incremental SG&A contributions from recently-acquired businesses other than SRS, I&S,
and CAP of $7.1 million; an increase in legal fees associated with the Mitchell patent infringement
litigation of $7.2 million; and a $4.0 million increase in professional fees.

-----

_Fiscal Year 2014 vs. Fiscal Year 2013._ During fiscal year 2014, SG&A increased $62.6 million,
or 26.7%, to $297.3 million and includes incremental SG&A contributions from SRS of $20.6 million.
On a constant currency basis and excluding incremental SG&A contributions from SRS, SG&A
increased $39.8 million, or 16.9%, primarily due to incremental SG&A contributions from recentlyacquired businesses other than SRS of $4.5 million; a $15.6 million increase in personnel related
expenses in our EMEA and Americas segments due to continued growth in our business; an $11.8
million increase in stock compensation expense primarily due to share-based compensation expense
associated with the long-term incentive awards granted to our executive officers in March 2013 and
more extensive use of equity-based incentive compensation in our compensation plans to incent
personnel for continued contributions to increasing our profitability and value during the first phase of
our previously-announced strategic mission; a $1.8 million increase in facilities expenses; a $1.0
million increase in bad debt expense; a $2.9 million increase in personnel, travel and recruiting
expenses; a $0.8 million increase in advertising and marketing expenses; and a $0.5 million increase
in professional fees.

**_Depreciation and amortization_**

_Fiscal Year 2015 vs. Fiscal Year 2014._ During fiscal year 2015, depreciation and amortization
increased by $39.9 million, or 32.6%, to $162.2 million and includes incremental depreciation and
amortization contributions from SRS, I&S, and CAP of $13.4 million, $13.5 million and $10.5 million,
respectively. On a constant currency basis and excluding incremental depreciation and amortization
contributions from SRS, I&S, and CAP, depreciation and amortization increased $7.6 million, or 7.2%,
for fiscal year 2015 primarily due to increase in depreciation expense associated with the increase in
capital investment and software development cost capitalization, offset by the continued decrease in
amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Explore and other
historical acquisitions.

_Fiscal Year 2014 vs. Fiscal Year 2013._ During fiscal year 2014, depreciation and amortization
increased by $19.0 million, or 18.4%, to $122.3 million and includes incremental depreciation and
amortization contributions from SRS of $17.9 million. On a constant currency basis and excluding
incremental depreciation and amortization contributions from SRS, depreciation and amortization
decreased $0.1 million, or 0.1%, for fiscal year 2014 primarily due to incremental contributions from
recently acquired businesses other than SRS, increase in depreciation expense associated with the
increase in capital investment and software development cost capitalization offset by the continued
decrease in amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Explore
and other historical acquisitions.

We generally amortize intangible assets on an accelerated basis to reflect the pattern in which
the economic benefits of the intangible assets are realized.

**_Restructuring charges, asset impairments and other costs associated with exit or disposal_**
**_activities_**

_Fiscal Year 2015 vs. Fiscal Year 2014 and Fiscal Year 2014 vs. Fiscal Year 2013._ During fiscal
years 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred restructuring charges, asset impairments and other costs
associated with exit or disposal activities of $6.3 million, $6.5 million and $5.4 million, respectively.

The restructuring charges, asset impairments and other costs associated with exit and disposal
activities incurred in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 consist primarily of employee termination
benefits and other costs incurred in relation to ongoing restructuring initiatives.

**_Acquisition and related costs_**

_Fiscal Year 2015 vs. Fiscal Year 2014 and Fiscal Year 2014 vs. Fiscal Year 2013._ During fiscal
years 2015, 2014 and 2013 we incurred acquisition and related costs of $35.2 million, $41.5 million
and $26.9 million, respectively.

Acquisition and related costs incurred during fiscal year 2015 consist primarily of contingent
purchase consideration that is deemed compensatory in nature of $13.0 million, legal and professional
fees incurred in connection with completed and contemplated business combinations of $16.0 million,
and other cost associated with completed acquisitions, including redundancy and integration costs of
$6.2 million.

Acquisition and related costs incurred in fiscal year 2014 primarily consists of contingent
purchase consideration that is deemed compensatory in nature of $25.4 million, legal and professional
fees incurred in connection with completed and contemplated business combinations of $7.1 million,
and other cost associated with completed acquisitions, including redundancy and integration cost of
$9.0 million.

Acquisition and related costs incurred in fiscal year 2013 primarily consists of contingent
purchase consideration that is deemed compensatory in nature of $15.7 million, $5.8 million of legal
and professional fees incurred in connection with completed and contemplated business combinations
and associated with the Federal Trade Commission’s investigation of our acquisition of Actual Systems
and the subsequent divestiture of Actual Systems’ businesses in the U.S. and Canada in August 2013,
and other costs associated with completed acquisitions of $5.4 million.

**_Interest expense_**

_Fiscal Year 2015 vs. Fiscal Year 2014._ During fiscal year 2015, interest expense increased
$17.3 million, or 16.1%, due primarily to the increase in our total outstanding debt to approximately
$2.5 billion resulting from the issuance of additional senior unsecured notes in November 2014 and
July 2015.

_Fiscal Year 2014 vs. Fiscal Year 2013._ During fiscal year 2014, interest expense increased
$37.9 million, or 54.5%, due primarily to the increase in our total outstanding debt to approximately
$1.9 billion resulting from the issuance of additional senior unsecured notes in fiscal year 2014.

**_Other (income) expense, net_**

_Fiscal Year 2015 vs. Fiscal Year 2014._ During fiscal year 2015, we recognized other (income)
expense, net of $(34.5) million, as compared to $64.0 million recognized during 2014. The increase in
other (income) expense, net is due primarily to unrealized and realized gains on derivative financial
instruments recognized in fiscal year 2015 of $57.9 million, resulting from the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar during the period, and the $63.3 million loss on debt extinguishment associated with the
redemption of our senior unsecured notes due 2018 incurred during 2014, offset by the impact of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany loans denominated in a currency
other than the functional currency of the local company which resulted in an increase in foreign
exchange losses of $26.8 million during fiscal year 2015.

_Fiscal Year 2014 vs. Fiscal Year 2013._ During fiscal year 2014, other expense, net increased by
$62.1 million primarily due to a $63.3 million loss on debt extinguishment associated with the
redemption of our senior unsecured notes due 2018 in November 2013 and the repayment of the
outstanding term loans under our senior secured credit facility in July 2013 offset by an $18.0 million

increase in gains on derivative instruments, a $16.5 million increase in net foreign currency transaction
gains on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local
company and a $3.0 million increase in gains on asset sales.

**_Income tax provision_**

_Fiscal Year 2015 vs. Fiscal Year 2014 and Fiscal Year 2014 vs. Fiscal Year 2013._ During fiscal
years 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded income tax provisions of $200.3 million, $30.1 million and
$30.8 million, respectively, which resulted in effective tax rates of 168.1%, 85.3% and 22.7%,
respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to the
recognition of deferred tax expense of approximately $149.5 million related to undistributed foreign
earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries generated in fiscal year 2015 and prior years, partially
offset by earnings in jurisdictions with lower income tax rates which are indefinitely reinvested. The
increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2014 was primarily attributable to the recognition of a
$24.8 million valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets, partially offset by earnings in
jurisdictions with lower income tax rates which are indefinitely reinvested.

Factors that impact our income tax provision include, but are not limited to, the mix of
jurisdictional earnings and varying jurisdictional income tax rates, establishment and release of
valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, permanent differences resulting from the book and tax
treatment of certain items, and discrete items. Future changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a
significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate.

We are subject to periodic changes in the amount of our income tax provision and these changes
could adversely affect our operating results; we may not be able to utilize all of our tax benefits before
they expire.

Primarily due to the increase in our U.S. debt service obligations resulting from the issuance of
additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million in November
2014 and the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$850.0 million in July 2015, management concluded that the ability to access certain amounts of
foreign earnings would provide greater flexibility to meet domestic cash flow needs without constraining
foreign objectives. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we withdrew the permanent
reinvestment assertion on $350.0 million of earnings generated by certain of our foreign subsidiaries
through fiscal year 2015. We provided for U.S. income taxes on the $350.0 million of undistributed
foreign earnings, resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax liability of approximately $123.7 million.
We recognized additional deferred income tax expense of $25.8 million related to the impact of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year 2015 on the portion of the
$350.0 million of unremitted earnings generated prior to fiscal year 2015.

We have not provided for U.S. federal or foreign income taxes, including withholding taxes, on the
remaining $840.7 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015.
We continue to assert that the $840.7 million of undistributed earnings is permanently reinvested in our
foreign operations and have no current plans to repatriate those earnings. If we were to distribute those
earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we could be subject to both U.S. income and foreign
taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. It is currently not practicable to
compute the residual taxes due on such earnings as we do not know the time or manner in which we
would distribute these earnings.

Significant judgment is required to apply the recognition and measurement criteria prescribed in
ASC Topic No. 740-10, Income Taxes. In addition, ASC Topic No. 740-10 applies to all income tax
positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which, if settled unfavorably, could

106


-----

adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. We record unrecognized
tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic No. 740 and adjust these liabilities when our
judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of
the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is
materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These
differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which
new information is available.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Pre-Transactions_**

Our principal sources of cash include cash generated from operations and the proceeds from the
issuance of the Existing Notes. Our principal uses of cash have been, and we expect them to continue
to be, for business combinations, debt service, dividends, stock repurchases, capital expenditures and
working capital.

As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $470.5 million. At December 31,
2015, our total current and long-term debt obligations were $3.1 billion, consisting of $1.7 billion related
to our 2021 Senior Notes and $1.4 billion related to our 2023 Senior Notes.

On July 16, 2015, we issued additional 2023 Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$850.0 million. The additional 2023 Senior Notes were issued at an original issue price of 99.500%
plus accrued interest from May 1, 2015. The net proceeds from the issuance of the additional 2023
Senior Notes of $842.5 million were used to finance the SRS Equity Buyout and repay the
$200.0 million unsecured term loan due May 2016.

In connection with the Merger, we commenced the Change of Control Offers for the Existing
Notes concurrently with the Tender Offers. As a result of receiving the Requisite Consents and
adopting the Proposed Amendments, the Change of Control Offers were terminated on November 23,
2015. See “The Transactions—The Tender Offers, Consent Solicitations and the Change of Control
Offers.” The Tender Offers are contingent upon, among other things, the simultaneous closing of the
Merger.

The indentures governing the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes contain limited
covenants, including those restricting our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain liens, engage in
sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge with, or convey, transfer or lease substantially
all of our or their assets to, another person, and, in the case of any of our subsidiaries that did not
issue or guarantee such notes, incur indebtedness. We are in compliance with the specified covenants
of the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes at December 31, 2015.

In November 2014, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program, replacing
the share repurchase program authorized in October 2013, for up to a total of $375 million of Solera
common stock through December 31, 2016. Share repurchases are made from time to time, through
an accelerated stock purchase agreement, in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or
in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program does not require us to purchase any
specific number or amount of shares, and the timing and amount of such purchases will be determined
by management based upon market conditions and other factors. In addition, the program may be
amended or terminated at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Through December 31, 2015, we
have repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for $78.8 million under the share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors in November 2014.

107


-----

On December 3, 2015, we paid a quarterly cash dividend with a value of $0.225 per outstanding
share of common stock and per outstanding restricted stock unit to our stockholders and restricted
stock unit holders of record on November 19, 2015. The aggregate dividend payments for the six
months ended December 31, 2015 was $30.5 million.

We believe that our existing cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund
currently anticipated working capital and debt service requirements, as well as investment of capital in
acquisition and other strategic and investment opportunities for at least the next twelve months.

Our management believes that our cash is best utilized by investing in the future growth of our
business to support improving our results of operations, either through acquisitions or penetration of
new geographic markets and other strategic opportunities, and maximizing stockholder return through
the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. We regularly review acquisition and other
strategic opportunities, which may require additional debt or equity financing. If we raise additional
funds by issuing equity securities, further dilution to our then-existing stockholders may result.
Additional debt financing may include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific
actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any
equity or debt financing may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences, that are not
favorable to us or our stockholders.

Our foreign subsidiaries generate earnings that are not subject to U.S. income taxes so long as
they are permanently reinvested in our operations outside of the United States. Pursuant to ASC Topic
No. 740-30 (formerly APB 23), undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are no longer
permanently reinvested would become subject to deferred income taxes under U.S. tax law. Prior to
fiscal year 2015, we asserted that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were
permanently reinvested.

Primarily due to the increase in our U.S. debt service obligations resulting from the issuance of
additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million in November
2014 and the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$850.0 million in July 2015, management concluded that the ability to access certain amounts of
foreign earnings would provide greater flexibility to meet domestic cash flow needs without constraining
foreign objectives. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we withdrew the permanent
reinvestment assertion on $350.0 million of earnings generated by certain of our foreign subsidiaries
through fiscal year 2015.

There is no certainty as to the timing of when such foreign earnings will be distributed to the U.S.
in whole or in part. Further, when the foreign earnings are distributed to the U.S., we anticipate that a
substantial portion of the resulting U.S. income taxes due would be reduced by existing deferred tax
assets.

We have not provided for U.S. federal or foreign income taxes, including withholding taxes, on the
remaining $840.7 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015.
We continue to assert that the $840.7 million of undistributed earnings is permanently reinvested in our
foreign operations and have no current plans to repatriate those earnings. If we were to distribute those
earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we could be subject to both U.S. income and foreign
taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. It is currently not practicable to
compute the residual taxes due on such earnings as we do not know the time or manner in which we
would distribute these earnings.

**_Six Months Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014_**

The following summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash in the periods presented (in
millions):

**Six Months**
**Ended December 31,**
**2015** **2014** **Change**

Operating activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ (2.0) $ 79.9 $ (81.9)
Investing activities. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (46.7) (803.3) 756.6
Financing activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26.0 293.0 (267.0)

_Operating activities._ The $81.9 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was
primarily attributable to increases in payments of contingent purchase consideration that is considered
compensatory in nature and interest payments on our senior unsecured notes.

_Investing activities._ The $756.6 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was
primarily attributable to a decrease in cash used to acquire businesses of $752.9 million and a
decrease in capital expenditures of $10.5 million, partially offset by an increase in acquisitions and
capitalization of intangible assets of $4.8 million.

_Financing activities._ The $267.0 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities is
primarily attributable to the use of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Senior Notes in July
2015 of $842.0 million to acquire the remaining equity ownership interest in SRS of $619.8 million and
the repayment of the unsecured term loan of $200.0 million, whereas cash provided by financing
activities for the six months ended December 31, 2014 includes the net proceeds from the issuance of
additional senior unsecured notes of $416.3 million, partially offset by repurchase of approximately 1.5
million shares for $82.8 million under our share repurchase programs.

**_Fiscal Years 2015, 2014 and 2013_**

The following summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash in the periods presented:


**Fiscal Years Ended June 30,**

**(in millions)** **2015** **2014** **2013**


**Amount Changed**
**from**


**2014 to**

_Operating activities._ The $32.6 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities during
fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in cash paid for interest due to the increase in
our outstanding debt obligations, an increase in cash paid for income taxes and an increase in cash
payments for contingent purchase consideration that is deemed compensatory in nature, offset by
operating cash flows generated by businesses acquired during fiscal year 2015, including CAP and I&S.

The $21.8 million increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2014 was
primarily attributable to operating cash flows generated by businesses acquired during fiscal year 2014,
including SRS, offset by an increase in cash paid for interest due to the increase in our outstanding debt.

_Investing activities._ The $569.6 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year
2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in cash used in business combinations, net of cash
acquired, of $541.8 million, due to the acquisition of six businesses during fiscal year 2015, an
increase in acquisitions and capitalization of intangible assets of $4.9 million and an increase in capital
expenditures of $19.4 million.

109


-----

The $236.1 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2014 was primarily
attributable to an increase in cash used in business combinations, net of cash acquired, of $220.0
million, due to the acquisition of six businesses during fiscal year 2014, including SRS, an increase in
acquisitions and capitalization of intangible assets of $13.8 million and an increase in capital
expenditures of $1.2 million.

_Financing activities._ The $(111.2) million decrease in cash provided by financing activities is
primarily attributable to a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments of
long-term debt, of $47.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease is a $51.2 million increase in stock
repurchases due to the adoption of a new share repurchase program in November 2014 and a
$13.3 million increase in payments of contingent purchase consideration.

The $630.6 million increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2014 was
primarily attributable to the proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior
Notes, net of the repayment of the outstanding term loans under the Amended Credit Facility and the
redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes, including the payment of the redemption premium, of
$661.9 million. The increase in cash provided by financing activities is offset by a $30.0 million
increase in stock repurchases due to the adoption of a new share repurchase program in October 2013
and a $12.4 million increase in dividend payments due to the increase in our annual dividend to
$0.68 per share in fiscal year 2014.

**_Post-Transactions_**

Following the consummation of the Transactions, our liquidity requirements will be significantly
changed, primarily due to the addition of debt service requirements to our existing cash needs
discussed above. Our principal sources of liquidity after the Transactions will be our existing cash and
cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our New Revolving Facility. Our
principal uses of cash after the consummation of the Transactions will be to fund capital expenditures,
provide working capital and meet debt service requirements. We believe that internally generated
funds and current cash on hand, together with borrowings under our New Revolving Facility, will
provide sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future. Our business may not generate sufficient cash
flows from operations or future borrowings may not be available to us under our New Revolving Facility
in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the notes offered hereby, or to
fund our other liquidity needs. Our ability to do so depends on, among other factors, prevailing
economic conditions, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain
events, such as a change in control, we could be required to repay or refinance our indebtedness. We
may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and the notes offered hereby, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any future
acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital and any such
capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

After the consummation of the Transactions, we will be substantially leveraged. On a pro forma
basis after giving effect to the Transactions, as of December 31, 2015, we would have had outstanding
$3,930.0 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, with an additional $300.0 million
unused availability available under the New Revolving Facility. We also can incur additional
indebtedness if certain specified conditions are met under the credit agreement that will govern the
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby. On a
pro forma basis, our estimated interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015
would have been $336.8 million. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the
Notes—Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us
from fulfilling our obligations under the notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness

110


-----

and the Notes—Despite our substantial level of indebtedness, the indenture that will govern the notes
will permit us and our subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness. This could further
exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.”

**_New Senior Secured Credit Facilities_**

In connection with the Merger, we will enter into a $2,200.0 million New Term Loan Facility and a
$300.0 million New Revolving Facility. Our obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities
will be guaranteed by each of our direct and indirect, existing and future, wholly-owned domestic
restricted subsidiaries (subject to customary exceptions). We do not expect to borrow under the New
Revolving Facility in connection with the Transactions, and as such, we expect that we will have
$300.0 million of unused availability under the New Revolving Facility following the consummation of
the Transactions.

We will be subject to certain customary covenants. The credit agreements that will govern the
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will contain covenants that impose restrictions on, among other
things, additional indebtedness, liens, investments, advances, guarantees and mergers and
acquisitions. These covenants will also place restrictions on asset sales, dividends and certain
transactions with affiliates. As of the date of this offering circular, the terms are not final and are subject
to change. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

**_Notes Offered Hereby_**

The notes offered hereby will be guaranteed by each of our existing and future restricted
subsidiaries to the extent such subsidiary guarantees the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or
certain syndicated bank debt and capital markets debt securities. The notes will rank equally in right of
payment with all of our existing and future senior debt, will be senior in right of payment to all of our
future subordinated debt and will be effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured
indebtedness, including the indebtedness under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, to the extent
of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. We will issue the notes under an indenture that
will contain customary covenants and events of default for an issuance of non-investment grade debt
securities. See “Description of Notes.”

**_Potential Payments Relating to Appraisal Rights_**

Holders of shares of Solera common stock who did not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement and who properly demanded appraisal rights of their shares and who otherwise
comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to seek appraisal for, and
obtain payment in cash for the judicially determined “fair value” (as defined pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL) of, their shares in lieu of receiving the merger consideration if the Merger is completed, but
only if they comply with all applicable requirements of Delaware law. This appraised value could be
more than, the same as, or less than the $55.85 per share merger consideration. As of February 26,
2016, Solera has received purported demands for appraisal with respect to approximately 7,149,364
shares of Solera common stock.

Upon completion of the Merger, we expect to record a liability of $55.85 for each share of Solera
common stock with respect to which appraisal has been properly demanded (representing
approximately $399.3 million if appraisal has been properly demanded with respect to all of the
approximately 7,149,364 shares for which appraisal demands have purported to have been delivered
as of February 26, 2016). In addition, we anticipate incurring interest charges equal to a per annum
rate (compounded quarterly) of 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) in
respect of such liability.

111


-----

Any payment in respect of the shares subject to appraisal rights will be required to be paid in
cash. As we are not able to determine the timing or amount of such payments, our liquidity position
may be adversely affected at the time any such payments are required to be made. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to the Merger—Holders of a substantial number of shares of Solera common
stock have purported to have delivered written demands for the appraisal of their shares under
Delaware law. If these appraisal demands are not withdrawn, or determined to be invalid, or do not
otherwise cease under Delaware law, the claims represented by such appraisal demands will
constitute a substantial contingent liability of ours and will also result in our incurring substantial
interest charges until they are resolved.”

**Contractual Obligations**

The following table reflects our cash contractual obligations as of June 30, 2015, after giving pro
forma effect to the Transactions, and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our
liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands):

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or
financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose
entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet
arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

Our consolidated financial statements included in this offering circular have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our
consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates. We base our
estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe
are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies, which may be affected by our estimates
and assumptions, are more fully described in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements
and in Note 1 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, each included elsewhere
in this offering circular. We believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions
may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others.

**_Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets._** Goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually or more
frequently if impairment indicators arise. Impairment indicators arise when events or changes in

112


-----

circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable, such as a
significant downturn in industry or economic trends with a direct impact on the business, an
expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of for less than the carrying value,
loss of key personnel, or a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group.

We test goodwill for impairment annually at a reporting unit level using a two-step process. The
first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with
their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds
the reporting unit’s fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to
determine the amount of the potential impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test
involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value
of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an
impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

We determine the fair value of our reporting units through a combination of an income approach,
utilizing a discounted cash flow model, and a market approach, which considers comparable
companies and transactions. Under the income approach, the discounted cash flow model determines
the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of projected reporting unit cash flows
over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection
period. Both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the
reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows. A weighted average cost of capital of a market
participant is used as the discount rate. The residual value is generally determined by applying a
constant terminal growth rate to the estimated reporting unit net cash flows at the end of the projection
period. Alternatively, the present value of the residual value may be determined by applying a market
multiple at the end of the projection period. In addition to the projected reporting unit cash flows, the
key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model include a discount rate and a long-term growth
rate. The discount rate used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting units as of
June 30, 2015 using the income approach ranged between 9.5% and 15.7%, with an average discount
rate of 11.9%. The long-term growth rate used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the
reporting units as of June 30, 2015 using the income approach ranged between 3.0% and 6.0%, with
an average long-term growth rate of 4.1%.

Under the market approach, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined based on multiples
of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for each reporting unit.
The multiples were determined based on a selection of comparable companies and acquisition
transactions, discounted for each reporting unit to reflect the relative size, diversification and risk of the
reporting unit in comparison to the indexed companies and transactions.

In our annual goodwill impairment assessment for fiscal year 2015, we concluded that the fair
values of the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned exceeded their respective carrying values
by at least 51% and by over 124% on average. Accordingly, we did not identify any goodwill
impairment.

Our estimates of the fair value of our reporting units can be affected by many assumptions that
require significant judgment. For example, the projected reporting unit cash flows used in the
discounted cash flow model under the income approach reflect assumptions related to existing
customer penetration, new customer acquisition, product innovation and development, total
addressable market, pricing, market share, competition and technology obsolescence. Our estimates
of fair value may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions. New
information may arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments
to our estimates in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

113


-----

We test indefinite-lived intangible assets at the unit of accounting level by making a determination
of the fair value of the intangible asset. If the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying
value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference. We also evaluate the
remaining useful life of our intangible assets that are not subject to amortization on an annual basis to
determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If an
intangible asset that is not being amortized is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, that
asset is tested for impairment. After recognition of the impairment, if any, the asset is amortized
prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other
intangible assets that are subject to amortization.

We determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets under an income approach
using the relief from royalty method, which assumes value to the extent that the acquired company is
relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the assets. In our annual
indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment for fiscal year 2015, we concluded that the fair
value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying value and,
accordingly, we did not identify any impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets.

**_Long-Lived Assets._** We review long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives
and property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an
impairment assessment include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group, a
significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used, the
loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, significant negative industry or economic trends or the
presence of other factors that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not
recoverable. We consider a long-lived asset to be impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash
flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are not sufficient to recover the
carrying value of the asset. If we deem an asset to be impaired, the amount of the impairment loss
represents the excess of the asset’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value.

**_Revenue Recognition._** Revenues are recognized only after services are provided, when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, and when
collectability is probable. Our multiple element arrangements primarily include a combination of
software licenses, hosted database and other services, installation and set-up services, hardware,
maintenance services and transaction-based deliverables.

We generate a significant majority of our revenue from subscription-based contracts (where a
monthly fee is charged), transaction-based contracts (where a fee per transaction is charged) and
subscription-based contracts with additional transaction-based fees (where a monthly fee and a fee per
transaction are charged).

Subscription-based and transaction-based contracts generally include the delivery of software,
access to our database through a hosted service, upfront fees for the implementation and set-up
activities necessary for the client to use/access the software and maintenance. Under a subscription
arrangement, we consider delivery of software, access to the hosted database and maintenance to be
a combined unit of accounting and recognize related revenues at the end of each month upon the
completion of the monthly service. A transaction-based fee represents a payment for the right to use
the software, access to the hosted database and maintenance. We consider the fee to be fixed and
determinable only at the time actual usage occurs, and, accordingly, we recognize revenue at the time
of actual usage.

Implementation services and set-up activities are necessary for the client to receive services/
software. We defer up-front fees billed during the implementation/set-up phase and recognize such

114


-----

revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated customer life. Recognition of this deferred revenue
will commence upon the start of the monthly service. Implementation and set-up costs that are direct
and incremental to the contract are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated customer life.

Revenues are reflected net of customer sales allowances, which are based on both specific
identification of certain accounts and a predetermined percentage of revenue based on historical
experience.

**_Share-Based Compensation._** We expense share-based payment awards made to employees
and directors, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units. We estimate
the value of stock options with vesting contingent upon the achievement of service conditions as of the
date the award was granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes optionpricing model requires the use of certain input variables, as follows:

‰ Expected Volatility. Volatility is a measure of the amount the stock price will fluctuate during
the expected life of an award. We determine the expected volatility based on the historical
volatility of our stock price.

‰ Risk-Free Interest Rate. We based the risk-free interest rates on the implied yield available
on U.S. Treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of the grant with remaining terms
equivalent to the respective expected terms of the stock options.

‰ Expected Dividend Yield. Our assumption of the dividend yield is based on our history and
expectation of future dividend payouts and may be subject to substantial change in the future.

‰ Expected Award Life. We determine the expected life of an award by considering various
relevant factors, including the vesting period and contractual term of the award, our employees’
historical exercise patterns and length of service, the expected future volatility of our stock price
and employee characteristics.

In addition to the variables above, we are also required to estimate at the grant date the likelihood
that the award will ultimately vest (the “pre-vesting forfeiture rate”), and revise the estimate, if
necessary, in future periods if the actual forfeiture rate differs. We determine the pre-vesting forfeiture
rate of an award based on industry and employee turnover data as well as historical pre-vesting
forfeitures occurring over the previous year. We recognize additional share-based compensation
expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated and a recovery of previously recognized
share-based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than estimated.

The fair value of restricted stock units with vesting contingent upon the achievement of service
conditions and performance share units with vesting contingent upon the achievement of performance
conditions equals the intrinsic value on the date the award was granted.

To estimate the grant date fair value of performance share units and stock options with vesting
contingent upon the achievement of market conditions, we utilize a Monte-Carlo simulation model
which simulates a range of possible future stock prices for us and the identified peer companies.

**_Income Taxes._** Income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes
payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax
consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax
returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of
currently enacted tax laws. The effects of future enactments of changes in tax laws or rates are not
contemplated.

115


-----

In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the
application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the
United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,
additional tax liabilities are more likely than not to be assessed. If we ultimately determine that the
obligation is unwarranted, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which
we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. This may occur for a variety of reasons, such as
the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a particular tax return or the signing of a final
settlement agreement with the respective tax authority. We record an additional charge in our provision
for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the
ultimate assessment to be.

As part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate
our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the
completion and filing of tax returns for such periods. This process involves estimating actual current tax
expense together with assessing temporary differences, or reversing book-tax differences, resulting
from differing treatment of items, such as amortization of intangibles, for tax and accounting purposes.
These differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities.

We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable using the morelikely-than-not standard. In our assessment, we consider all available evidence, both positive and
negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of
future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If we determine that
our deferred tax assets do not meet the more-likely-than-not standard, we establish a valuation
allowance. We exercise significant judgment relating to the projection of future taxable income. If
judgments regarding recoverability of deferred tax assets change in future periods, we may need to
adjust our valuation allowances, which could impact our results of operations in the period in which
such determination is made.

As of December 31, 2015, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax
assets of $26.9 million due to the limitation in our ability to utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards prior
to the expiration of the carryforward periods.

In assessing the future realization of our U.S. deferred tax assets, all available evidence was
considered, including our U.S. cumulative income or loss position over the 12 quarters ended June 30,
2015 which included recent increases to interest expense. The U.S. cumulative loss position reduced
the weight given to subjective evidence such as projections for future growth. As of each reporting
date, our management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact
management’s view with regards to future realization of deferred tax assets. The Company relies
heavily on Subpart F income as a future source of taxable income to support the conclusion that the
domestic deferred tax assets were more-likely-than-not realizable. We believe that our estimate of
future taxable income is reasonable but inherently uncertain, and if our current or future operations and
investments generate taxable income different than the anticipated amounts or U.S. tax law changes
reduce future Subpart F income, adjustments to the valuation allowance are possible.

Our foreign subsidiaries generate earnings that are not subject to U.S. income taxes so long as
they are permanently reinvested in our operations outside of the U.S. Pursuant to ASC Topic
No. 740-30 (formerly APB 23), undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are no longer
permanently reinvested would become subject to deferred income taxes under U.S. tax law. In
determining if the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested, we
consider the following: (i) the forecasts, budgets and cash requirements of our U.S business and our
foreign subsidiaries, both for the short and long term; (ii) the tax consequences of any decision to
reinvest foreign earnings, including any changes in U.S. income tax law relating to the treatment of

116


-----

these undistributed foreign earnings; and (iii) any U.S. and foreign government programs or regulations
relating to the repatriation of these unremitted earnings. If we were to conclude that our foreign
earnings are no longer permanently reinvested, we would be required to provide deferred income taxes
on these earnings, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations. Further, if we
initiate actions to repatriate these unremitted earnings and precipitate payments of U.S. income taxes,
such payments could materially adversely affect our liquidity.

Prior to fiscal year 2015, we asserted that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries
were permanently reinvested.

Primarily due to the increase in our U.S. debt service obligations resulting from the issuance of
additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million during fiscal year
2015 and the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$850.0 million in July 2015, management concluded that the ability to access certain amounts of
foreign earnings would provide greater flexibility to meet domestic cash flow needs without constraining
foreign objectives. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we withdrew the permanent
reinvestment assertion on $350.0 million of earnings generated by certain of our foreign subsidiaries
through fiscal year 2015. We provided for U.S. income taxes on the $350.0 million of undistributed
foreign earnings, resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax liability of approximately $123.7 million.
We recognized additional deferred income tax expense of $25.8 million related to the impact of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year 2015 on the portion of the $350.0
million of unremitted earnings generated prior to fiscal year 2015.

There is no certainty as to the timing of when such foreign earnings will be distributed to the U.S.
in whole or in part. Further, when the foreign earnings are distributed to the U.S., we anticipate that a
substantial portion of the resulting U.S. income taxes due would be reduced by existing deferred tax
assets.

We have not provided for U.S. federal or foreign income taxes, including withholding taxes, on the
remaining $840.7 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015.
We continue to assert that the $840.7 million of undistributed earnings is permanently reinvested in our
foreign operations and have no current plans to repatriate those earnings. If we were to distribute those
earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we could be subject to both U.S. income and foreign
taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. It is currently not practicable to
compute the residual taxes due on such earnings as we do not know the time or manner in which we
would distribute these earnings.

**_Derivative Financial Instruments._** We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage
interest rate and foreign currency exposures. Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the
consolidated balance sheets at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge or net
investment hedge, the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are initially
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are subsequently reclassified into
earnings when the hedged transactions occur and affect earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in
the fair value of cash flow and net investment hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings.
Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market at the end of each period with
changes in fair value recognized in earnings.

The following is a summary of outstanding derivative financial instruments as of December 31,
2015:

‰ In April 2012, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency
swaps in the aggregate notional amount of €109.0 million. We pay Euro fixed coupon

117


-----

payments at 6.990% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.750% on the notional
amount. The maturity date of the swaps is June 15, 2018. These cross-currency swaps were
designated, at inception, as cash flow hedges and we evaluate the swaps for effectiveness
quarterly. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these
gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. To date, there has
been no hedge ineffectiveness.

‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay floating / received fixed interest rate swap with a
notional amount of $400.0 million. Under the terms of the interest rate swap, we pay quarterly
floating coupon payments at 3-month LIBOR plus 3.924% and receive semi-annual fixed
coupon payments at 6.000%. The maturity date of the interest rate swap is June 15, 2021,
although the swap may be terminated at any time effective June 15, 2017 by the counterparty
subject to the payment of a cancellation fee. The interest rate swap was not designated as a
hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap in other
(income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars crosscurrency swap with a notional amount of €401.6 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency
swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.993% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon
payments at 6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is
June 15, 2021. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We
recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net
in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

‰ In March 2015, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency
swap with a notional amount of €174.8 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we
pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.725% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at
6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is June 15,
2021. The cross-currency swap was designated as a net investment hedge at inception. We
report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these gains or losses
into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. On October 1, 2015, we dedesignated this cross-currency swap as a net investment hedge. Upon de-designation, we
recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net
in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

‰ In March 2015, we entered into a foreign exchange forward contract with a notional amount of
€472.9 million. Under the terms of the forward contract, we pay predetermined forward rate on
the settlement date. The foreign exchange forward contract was not designated as a hedge at
inception. We recognize changes in the fair value in other (income) expense, net in our
consolidated statements of income (loss). In July 2015, we partially settled the foreign
exchange forward contract for a cash payment of $8.9 million which is reported in other
(income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Settlement of the
remaining foreign exchange forward contract with a notional amount of €235.8 million was
extended to July 2016.

‰ In July 2015, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency
swaps, each with a notional amount of €137.0 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency
swaps, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.135% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon
payments at 6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swaps is
November 1, 2018. One of the cross-currency swaps was designated as a net investment
hedge at inception and one was not designated as a hedge at inception. We report the effective
portion of the gain or loss on the cross-currency swap designated as a net investment hedge

118


-----

as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and
reclassify these gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. On
October 1, 2015, we de-designated this cross currency swap as a net investment hedge. Upon
de-designation, we recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swaps in other
(income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

‰ In July 2015, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swap
with a notional amount of €274.0 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we pay
Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.585% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at
6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is November 1,
2023. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize
changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net in our
consolidated statements of income (loss).

We determined the estimated fair value of our derivatives using an income approach and
standard valuation techniques that utilize market-based observable inputs including spot and forward
interest and foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities and interest rate curves at observable
intervals. Our estimate of fair value also considers the risk that the swap contracts will not be fulfilled.

**_Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests._** Certain of the ownership interests in our consolidated
subsidiaries held by noncontrolling owners are considered redeemable outside of our control.
Accordingly, we have presented these redeemable noncontrolling interests as a mezzanine item in our
consolidated balance sheet.

If redeemable at fair value, the redeemable noncontrolling interests are reported at their fair value
with any adjustment of the carrying value to fair value recorded to common shares in stockholders’
equity. We estimate the fair value of our noncontrolling interests through an income approach, utilizing
a discounted cash flow model, and a market approach, which considers comparable companies and
transactions.

Under the income approach, the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the
present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to
future cash flows beyond the projection period. Both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk
inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows. A weighted
average cost of capital of a market participant is used as the discount rate. The residual value is
generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the estimated net cash flows at the
end of the projection period. Alternatively, the present value of the residual value may be determined
by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period.

Under the market approach, fair value is determined based on multiples of revenues and
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for each reporting unit. The multiples
were determined based on a selection of comparable companies and acquisition transactions,
discounted for each reporting unit to reflect the relative size, diversification and risk of the reporting unit
in comparison to the indexed companies and transactions.

Although we considered the fair value under both the income and market approaches, we
ultimately determined the fair value of our redeemable noncontrolling interests based solely upon the
income approach, which utilizes a discounted cash flow as we believe this is the best indicator of fair
value. The key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model include a discount rate and a long-term
growth rate. The discount rate used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the redeemable
noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2015 using the income approach ranged between 12.8%
and 16.4%, with a weighted average discount rate of 13.2%, reflecting a market participant’s

119

**Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted**

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic No. 605, Revenue Recognition,
and most industry-specific guidance. This guidance primarily requires an entity to recognize revenue to
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In
August 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Deferral of the effective date, which deferred the effective date of ASU Topic No. 2014-09
for one year. As a result, ASU Topic No. 2014-09 will be effective for our fiscal year 2019. ASU Topic
No. 2014-09 permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have
not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the effect that ASU Topic No. 2014-09
will have on our financial condition, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an
_Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to perform interim and_
annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of
issuance of the entity’s financial statements. ASU Topic No. 2014-15 is effective for our fiscal year
2017. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial
statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015-3, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic
_835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs_
related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU Topic No. 2015-3 is effective
for our fiscal year 2017. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU Topic No. 2015-03 for
debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, in August 2015, the FASB issued
ASU Topic No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs
_Associated With Line-of-Credit Arrangements—Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff_
_Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting, which clarified the presentation and measurement_
requirements of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit arrangements.
ASU Topic No. 2015-15 allows an entity to either defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset
and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit
arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit
arrangement, or present them as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt as provided
by ASU Topic No. 2015-3. ASU Topic No. 2015-15 is effective for our fiscal year 2017. The adoption of
these standards will result in reclassification of debt issuance costs from assets to liabilities.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015-5, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal_Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing_
_Arrangement, which provides guidance to help entities determine whether a cloud computing_
arrangement includes a software license and evaluate fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing
arrangement. ASU Topic No. 2015-5 is effective for our fiscal year 2017. We do not expect the
adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805):
_Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which allows an entity to recognize_
adjustments to provisional amounts that in a business combination in the reporting period in which the

120


-----

adjustment amounts are determined. ASU Topic No. 2015-16 is effective for our fiscal year 2017. We do
not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements.

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance
_Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified_
as noncurrent assets or noncurrent liabilities. ASU Topic No. 2015-16 is effective for our fiscal year 2018.
We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2016-1, Financial Statements - Overall
_(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,_
which requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized in income; use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial
instruments for disclosure purposes; separate presentation of financial assets and financial
liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the
accompanying notes to the financial statements; present separately in other comprehensive
income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the
instrument-specific credit risk; and eliminates the requirement disclose the method(s) and
significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial
instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. ASU Topic No. 2016-1 is effective
for our fiscal year 2019. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact
on our financial statements.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

**_Pre-Transactions_**

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

We conduct operations in many countries around the world. As a result, our results of operations
are subject to both currency transaction risk and currency translation risk. We incur currency
transaction risk when we enter into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency other than
the local functional currency. With respect to currency translation risk, our financial condition and
results of operations are measured and recorded in the relevant local functional currency and then
translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.

Exchange rates between most of the major foreign currencies we use to transact our business
and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and we expect that they will
continue to fluctuate. The majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in Euros,
Pound Sterling, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars and other foreign currencies. The following table
provides the average quarterly exchange rates for the Euro and Pound Sterling since the beginning of
fiscal year 2015:

During fiscal year 2015, as compared to fiscal year 2014, the U.S. dollar strengthened against
most major foreign currencies we use to transact our business. The average U.S. dollar strengthened

121


-----

versus the Euro by 11.4% and the Pound Sterling by 3.2%, which decreased our revenues and
expenses during fiscal year 2015. A hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in the U.S. dollar versus
other currencies in which we transact our business would have resulted in an increase or decrease, as
the case may be, to our revenues of $31.7 million during fiscal year 2015.

During the six months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the six months ended
December 31, 2014 the U.S. dollar strengthened against most major foreign currencies we use to
transact our business. The average U.S. dollar strengthened versus the Euro by 14.3% and the
Pound Sterling by 5.7%, which decreased our revenues and expenses for the six months ended
December 31, 2015. A hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in the U.S. dollar versus other currencies
in which we transact our business would have resulted in an increase or decrease, as the case may
be, to our revenues of $15.5 million during the six months ended December 31, 2015.

The following is a summary of outstanding derivative financial instruments as of December 31,
2015 that are relevant to our exposure to foreign currency risk:

‰ In April 2012, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency
swaps in the aggregate notional amount of €109.0 million. We pay Euro fixed coupon
payments at 6.990% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.750% on the notional
amount. The maturity date of the swaps is June 15, 2018. These cross-currency swaps were
designated, at inception, as cash flow hedges and we evaluate the swaps for effectiveness
quarterly. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these
gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. To date, there has
been no hedge ineffectiveness.

‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay floating / received fixed interest rate swap with a
notional amount of $400.0 million. Under the terms of the interest rate swap, we pay quarterly
floating coupon payments at 3-month LIBOR plus 3.924% and receive semi-annual fixed
coupon payments at 6.000%. The maturity date of the interest rate swap is June 15, 2021,
although the swap may be terminated at any time effective June 15, 2017 by the counterparty
subject to the payment of a cancellation fee. The interest rate swap was not designated as a
hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap in other
(income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars crosscurrency swap with a notional amount of €401.6 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency
swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.993% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon
payments at 6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is
June 15, 2021. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We
recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net
in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

‰ In March 2015, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency
swap with a notional amount of €174.8 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we
pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.725% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at
6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is June 15,
2021. The cross-currency swap was designated as a net investment hedge at inception. We
report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these gains or losses
into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. On October 1, 2015, we dedesignated this cross currency swap as a net investment hedge. Upon de-designation, we
recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expenses, net
in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

122


-----

‰ In March 2015, we entered into a foreign exchange forward contract with a notional amount of
€472.9 million. Under the terms of the forward contract, we pay predetermined forward rate on the
settlement date. The foreign exchange forward contract was not designated as a hedge at
inception. We recognize changes in the fair value in other (income) expense, net in our
consolidated statements of income (loss). In July 2015, we partially settled the foreign exchange
forward contract for a cash payment of $8.9 million which is reported in other (income) expense, net
in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Settlement of the remaining foreign exchange
forward contract with a notional amount of €235.8 million was extended to July 2016.

‰ In July 2015, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency
swaps, each with a notional amount of €137.0 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency
swaps, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.135% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon
payments at 6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swaps is
November 1, 2018. One of the cross-currency swaps was designated as a net investment
hedge at inception and one was not designated as a hedge at inception. We report the effective
portion of the gain or loss on the cross-currency swap designated as a net investment hedge
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and
reclassify these gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. On
October 1, 2015, we de-designated this cross currency swap as a net investment hedge. Upon
de-designation, we recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swaps in other
(income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

‰ In July 2015, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swap
with a notional amount of €274.0 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we pay
Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.585% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at
6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is November 1,
2023. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize
changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net in our
consolidated statements of income (loss).

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Our outstanding long-term debt as of December 31, 2015 consists entirely of senior unsecured
notes that bear interest at a fixed interest rate. Accordingly, we are not subject to interest rate risk on
our indebtedness. However, in November 2014, we entered into a pay floating / received fixed interest
rate swap with a notional amount of $400.0 million. Under the terms of the interest rate swap, we pay
quarterly floating coupon payments at 3-month LIBOR plus 3.924% and receive semi-annual fixed
coupon payments at 6.000%. The maturity date of the interest rate swap is June 15, 2021, although
the swap may be terminated at any time effective June 15, 2017 by the counterparty subject to the
payment of a cancellation fee. The interest rate swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We
recognize changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap in other (income) expense, net in our
consolidated statements of income.

**_Post-Transactions_**

We will be exposed to changes in interest rate following the Transactions. Borrowings under the
New Term Loan Facility and the New Revolving Facility will be variable rate debt. Interest rate changes
generally impact the amount of our interest payments and, therefore, our future net income and cash
flows, assuming other factors are held constant.

Assuming we had completed the Transactions and applied the proceeds as set forth in the
section “Use of Proceeds” as of December 31, 2015, we would have had $2,200.0 million aggregate
principal amount of variable rate debt. Holding other variables constant, an increase in interest rates by
0.25% (25 basis points) on our variable debt would increase our annual interest expense by
approximately $5.5 million.

**Our History**

Solera Holdings, LLC was founded in March 2005 by Tony Aquila, our Chairman of the Board,
Chief Executive Officer and President, and affiliates of GTCR Golder Rauner II, L.L.C., a private equity
firm. In April 2006, subsidiaries of Solera Holdings, LLC acquired Claim Services Group, which was
originally founded in 1966 by Swiss Re Corporation, from Automatic Data Processing, Inc. for
approximately $1.0 billion (the “CSG Acquisition”). Prior to the CSG Acquisition, Solera Holdings, LLC’s
operations consisted primarily of developing our business plan, recruiting personnel, providing
consulting services, raising capital and identifying and evaluating operating assets for acquisition.

In connection with our initial public offering in May 2007, we converted from Solera Holdings,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, into Solera Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and all of
the Class A Common Units and Class B Preferred Units of Solera Holdings, LLC were converted into
shares of Solera common stock.

We have deployed approximately $4 billion in capital in 40 transactions since 2006 to expand our
platform from collision repair to all aspects of vehicle lifecycle ownership.

**Platforms**

We currently operate three platforms—RMS, SMR and CRM. At the core of our software and
services are our proprietary databases. Each of our databases has been adapted for use in our local
markets. Over the last five years, we have invested over $100 million annually (including $135 million
in fiscal year 2015) to maintain and expand our proprietary databases and related software
applications. Our primary databases include our repair estimating database, our total loss database,
our claims database, our vehicle validation database, our motor vehicle record database, our salvage
parts database, our service maintenance and repair databases, our customer retention solution
databases and our property database.

The descriptions of the risk and asset management solutions provided by our platforms are

**_The Automobile Insurance Claims Process_**

An overview of the automobile insurance claims process and its complexities provides a
framework for understanding how our customers can derive value from our software and services. The
automobile insurance claims process generally begins following an automobile collision and consists of
the following steps:

**First Notice of Loss** ‰ The policyholder initiates the claim process with the insurance company.

‰ The insurance company assigns the claim to an assessor and/or a collision
repair facility.

**Investigation** ‰ The assessor conducts interviews, examines photos and reviews police
reports.

‰ The insurance company, assessor or collision repair facility estimates the
cost to repair the vehicle.

‰ In the case of a heavily damaged vehicle, the assessor or collision repair
facility may request a pre-accident vehicle valuation.

**Evaluation** ‰ The insurance company reviews the estimate and/or pre-accident valuation
and confirms the results of the investigation.

‰ The insurance company may request additional information and/or require
follow-up investigation.

**Decision** ‰ The insurance company determines whether the vehicle should be repaired
or declared a total loss.

‰ Based on its evaluation, the insurance company determines who is liable for
the claim and the repair or total loss amount it intends to pay.

**Settlement** ‰ The insurance company notifies the policyholder or the collision repair facility
of the amount it intends to pay.

127


-----

‰ The policyholder or collision repair facility may negotiate the final payment
amount with the insurance company.

‰ In some cases, two or more insurance companies may settle claims
amongst themselves depending on fault or payment liability.

**Vehicle Repair** ‰ The collision repair facility repairs the vehicle if it is not a total loss.

‰ The collision repair facility or the insurance company may periodically
communicate the repair status to the insured policyholder.

‰ The collision repair facility purchases replacement parts from original
equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, aftermarket parts makers or automotive
recyclers.

‰ Further revisions to the claim payment amount may occur if additional
damage or cost savings are identified.

**Payment** ‰ The insurance company pays the policyholder or the collision repair facility in
the case of a repairable vehicle.

‰ The insurance company pays the policyholder the pre-accident value (less
the amount of the insurance deductible) of the vehicle in the case of a total
loss.

‰ The insurance company is paid the actual cash value of the total loss vehicle
by the buyer of the salvage vehicle.

Each of these steps consists of multiple actions requiring significant and complex interaction
among several parties. For example, the investigation step generally involves insurance companies,
assessors, collision repair facilities and automotive recyclers and includes conducting interviews,
taking and examining photographs, obtaining and reviewing police reports and estimating repair costs
and salvage values. When performed manually, many of these tasks, such as the mailing of vehicle
photographs or the estimating of vehicle repair costs, can be time-consuming. In addition, without an
efficient means of communication that facilitates real-time access to data, claim-related negotiations
can result in increased cycle times and unnecessary costs.

**_Key Drivers of Automobile Insurance Claims Processing Demand_**

The primary participants in the automobile insurance claims processing industry with whom we do
business are automobile insurance companies, collision repair facilities, independent assessors and
automobile dealers, service, maintenance and repair facilities, and automotive recyclers, salvage, and
dealerships. We believe that the principal drivers of demand for our software and services are:

_Claims process fragmentation_

The automobile insurance claims process involves many parties and consists of many steps,
which are often managed through paper, fax and other labor intensive processes. Our software and
services simplify and streamline the claims process, allowing our customers to process claims faster
and reduce their costs.

_Asymmetrical information_

Collision repair facilities typically have more information about vehicles in their shops than do
insurance companies who often must make their damage estimates remotely or with limited
information. Our databases provide insurance companies access to detailed information about vehicle
damage, repair times and replacement costs, allowing them to more accurately estimate fair settlement
values and reduce overpayment on claims.

128


-----

_Disparate claims data_

Claims-related data generated by automobile insurance companies often is not stored, shared
with other parties or captured in a format that is easily transferable to other applications. This,
combined with the inability to transfer and manipulate data easily across multiple applications, hinders
comparisons of repairs and claims. Our databases are constantly updated for actual claims data from
industry participants. Having access to our databases helps insurance companies generate more
accurate repair estimates and identify top-performing collision repair facilities.

_Conflicting interests of industry participants_

Collision repair facilities benefit from high repair costs, which increase their revenues.
Conversely, insurance companies benefit from low repair costs, which reduce their expenses. This
conflict can result in high settlement costs and delays. Our software and services provide repair cost
estimates that rely on common data sources which in turn reduce these costs and delays.

_Inefficient collision repair facility workflow_

Many collision repair facilities manage their complex workflows manually or without specialized
software. Manual workflow management leads to increased processing time, higher costs and more
errors, problems that generally intensify as vehicles become more technologically complex, the number
of vehicle models proliferate and as repair facilities grow. Our claims processing software and services
assist collision repair facilities in effectively managing their workflows and obtaining detailed part
availability and pricing information.

_Importance of communications between insurance and repair companies and their customers_

Insurance policyholders and collision repair customers increasingly rank communications and
access to information as critical factors in their satisfaction. These factors directly impact their decisionmaking process as well as their willingness to recommend body shops to their insureds. Our software
and services enable our insurance and collision repair customers to provide transparent
communications, increasing both customer retention and new customer acquisition.

**_Our Automotive Claims Solutions and Databases_**

Our automotive software and services include the following general categories: estimating and
workflow software and databases, salvage disposition software, subrogation solutions, automotive
glass solutions, business intelligence and consulting services. The majority of our customers access
our software and services through a standard Web browser utilizing a “software on demand” model. By
subscribing to our services, our customers can reduce upfront investments in software, hardware,
implementation services and information technology staff that they would typically make with traditional
software solutions.

_Estimating and Workflow Software_

Our core offering is our estimating and workflow software. Our estimating and workflow software
helps our customers manage the overall claims process, estimate the cost to repair a damaged
vehicle, and calculate the pre-collision fair market value of a vehicle. Key functions of our estimating
and workflow software include: capturing first notice of loss information; assigning, managing and
monitoring claims and claim-related events; accessing and exchanging claims-related information;
calculating, submitting, tracking and storing repair and total loss estimates; reviewing, assessing and
reporting estimate variations based upon pre-set rules; routing shop estimates for manual review; and
scheduling repairs and automating parts ordering.

129


-----

_Salvage Disposition Software_

Generally, if the estimated cost to repair a vehicle reaches a threshold or percentage of the actual
cash value of the vehicle, it is declared a total loss. Our salvage disposition software and networks help
insurers maximize the proceeds of disposing of the totaled vehicle by connecting buyers and sellers via
an electronic auction network. Key functions of our salvage disposition software include: determining
the value of a vehicle in real-time as the repair estimate is being written to determine the actual cash
value as an aid in determining if a vehicle is a total loss; determining the actual cash value of a vehicle
allowing the insurance company to maximize its yield; and connecting sellers with qualified buyers.

_Subrogation_

We provide web-based subrogation solutions that lower processing costs, automate processes
for efficiency, provide objectivity, and increase accuracy for both subrogation claims and out-of-network
claims in the United States. This drives consumer satisfaction by allowing insurance companies,
assessors, and collision repair shops to seamlessly process out-of-network claims, regardless of the
estimating platform being used.

_Claims Database_

Our claims database enables our customers to evaluate their internal claims process
performance, as well as measure the performance of their business partners. Our employees also use
this database to provide consulting services to our customers and develop new software and services.
Customers use this database to benchmark their performance against their local peer group through
detailed analyses of comprehensive industry data. Compiled over the past 15 years, this database
contains approximately two billion data records representing over 340 million automobile repair claims
and over $200 billion in claims payments. We update this database by incorporating more than
650,000 additional repair estimates every week.

_Repair Estimating Database_

We have developed our repair estimating database over 48 years through the development,
collection, organization and management of automobile-related information. The data in this database
enables our customers to estimate the cost to repair a damaged vehicle. This database:

‰ contains detailed cost data for each part and the required labor operations needed to complete
repairs on over 5,500 vehicle types;

‰ covers over 99.2% of the vehicle models in our core markets;

_Salvage Vehicle Database_

Our salvage vehicle database helps our customers buy, sell and estimate the value of salvage
vehicles. Through our eSalvage exchange each year, our customers list approximately 1.2 million
salvage vehicles for sale and more than 10,600 qualified bidders enter approximately 8.0 million bids
for the purchase of salvage vehicles.

_Automotive Glass Repair_

Claims involving the breakage of vehicle glass, are characterized as high-frequency, low-severity
and have long been considered a burden in claim operations for many major insurance carriers. Since
auto glass-only claims represent a small fraction of total auto severity, carriers often outsource these
claims in order to focus on the higher dollar cases, such as total loss and auto/medical claims. There
are about 14 million glass repair or replacements performed annually in the United States.
Approximately one-half of these are insured claims.

Operating under the brand names of LYNX Services, GTS Services and GLAXIS, we provide
software and business management tools, third-party claims administration, first notice of loss and
network management services to the U.S. auto insurers, glass repair facilities and suppliers
specializing in glass claims. Our services allow insurance companies to cost-effectively handle glass
claims while providing high levels of customer service to their customers. In addition, through our
software services, we allow glass repair facilities to operate more efficiently through enhanced
workflow and scheduling. We also create efficiency within the supply chain by connecting glass repair
facilities and suppliers.

**_Our Property Claims Solutions and Databases_**

In addition to automobile insurance, many of our insurance customers also provide property
insurance. Through the use of our products and services, we can now deliver efficiency,
standardization and transparency to the property repair process. Insurers face many of the same
challenges in property insurance claims as in auto collision repair:

_Claims process fragmentation_

The property insurance claims process involves many parties and consists of many steps, which
are often managed through paper, fax and other labor intensive processes. Our software and services
simplify and streamline the claims process, allowing our customers to process claims faster and reduce
their costs.

_Asymmetrical information_

Property repair contractors typically have more information about the repair process than do
insurance companies who often must make their damage estimates remotely or with limited
information. Our databases provide insurance companies access to detailed information about property
damage, repair times and replacement costs, allowing them to more accurately estimate fair settlement
values and reduce overpayment on claims.

_Disparate claims data_

Claims-related data generated by property insurance companies often is not stored, shared with
other parties or captured in a format that is easily transferable to other applications. This, combined
with the inability to transfer and manipulate data easily across multiple applications, hinders
comparisons of repairs and claims. Our databases are constantly updated for actual claims data from
industry participants. Having access to our databases helps insurance companies generate more
accurate repair estimates and identify top-performing collision repair facilities.

131


-----

_Conflicting interests of industry participants_

Property repair contractors benefit from high repair costs, which increase their revenues.
Conversely, insurance companies benefit from low repair costs, which reduce their expenses. This
conflict can result in high settlement costs and delays. Our software and services provide repair cost
estimates that rely on common data sources which in turn reduce these costs and delays.

Through Sachcontrol, we now have a proprietary property database of approximately 160 million
data points which delivers significant value to insurers by providing fast and accurate property claims
invoice checking resulting in claims cost reduction. Sachcontrol’s data set, the most comprehensive of
its kind in Germany and Austria, is localized across 3,700 zip codes and covers 19,000 repair steps
and over 20 construction trades.

**SMR: Service, Maintenance & Repair Platform**

Our SMR platform empowers automotive repair professionals to diagnose and repair vehicles
efficiently, accurately and profitably by leveraging proprietary data and processes. Additionally, our
SMR platform includes a premier parts procurement platform sourcing all part types including OEM,
aftermarket and recycled parts, serving both collision and mechanical repair facilities. These
applications help automotive repair facilities increase their efficiency, profitability and customer loyalty.

Our SMR platform represented 14% of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2015. SMR revenue was $160 million, $112 million and $53 million for the fiscal years ended June 30,
2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing a CAGR of approximately 74%. We estimate that the
total addressable market for SMR is approximately $8 billion, consisting of approximately $3 billion in
diagnostic solutions and approximately $5 billion in parts solutions.

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, SMR generated 5% and 95% of its revenues from
EMEA and Americas, respectively, and 61% and 39% of its revenues from diagnostic solutions and
parts solutions, respectively.

**_Vehicle Maintenance, Diagnostics and Mechanical Repair Process_**

An overview of the automobile maintenance, diagnostics and repair process and its complexities
provides a framework for understanding how our customers can derive value from our software and
services.

OEMs typically provide a warranty on new vehicles for a period of years or miles covered. These
warranties cover specified repairs and sometimes maintenance during the warranty period and these
services are typically performed at the automobile dealer. Motor vehicle service is a series of
maintenance procedures carried out at a set time interval or after the vehicle has travelled a certain
distance. The vehicle manufacturer specifies service intervals and some modern cars display the due
date for the next service electronically on the instrument panel.

There are 16,400 automobile dealers in the United States. According to the NADA, in 2014,
warranty work performed by franchised dealers was valued at $17.1 billion in service and parts—all at
no cost to the vehicle owner. Additionally, NADA estimated Americans spent a total of $91.7 billion at
franchised dealerships in 2014 for repairs, maintenance, tires, batteries, oil and accessories for
automobiles and light trucks used in personal transportation.

After the OEM warranty expires, vehicle owners typically have their vehicles serviced and
maintained at either an automobile dealer or at chain or independent repair facility.

132


-----

There are approximately 275,000 chain and independent repair facilities in the United States. An
NHTSA analysis led to a primary estimate that approximately 40% of the costs associated with auto
repair were unnecessary. The NHTSA reports that the consumer losses associated with improper
repair and maintenance are attributable to (among other factors):

‰ Unneeded repairs due to inadequate diagnosis;

‰ Unneeded repairs sold with possible fraudulent intent;

‰ Wasteful over-frequent preventive maintenance;

‰ Accidents due to under maintenance or faulty repairs; and

‰ Cars prematurely retired due to under maintenance or faulty repairs.

**_Key Drivers of Vehicle Maintenance, Diagnostics and Mechanical Repair Process Demand_**

The automotive SMR market is driven by a structural and growing imbalance between supply and
demand. Supply is constrained by a diminishing number of highly qualified auto technicians (due to
aging/retirement of the technician population and fewer technicians becoming certified) capable of
efficiently diagnosing and servicing today’s increasingly complex vehicles. Demand, on the other hand,
is increasing due to a confluence of several factors, including:

‰ Near-record high of 253 million vehicles in operation in the United States, and growing, with
new-vehicle sales expected to reach pre-2008 recession levels of over 16.4 million units by
2014, according to NADA;

‰ The average age of vehicles on the road in the United States is at a record high of almost
11.4 years according to the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association; and

‰ Increasing vehicle complexity.

**_Our Vehicle Maintenance, Diagnostics and Mechanical Repair Solutions and Databases_**

One of the most efficient ways to bridge the growing gap between fewer and less experienced
technicians servicing a greater number of more technologically complex vehicles, is to empower those
technicians through the implementation and application of technology.

Vehicle SMR generates the overwhelming majority of operating profits for both aftermarket shops
and dealerships, reinforcing their imperative to meet growing market demand effectively. In this
context, the ability to increase the quality and efficiency of automotive service and repair, and improve
vehicle owner satisfaction and retention, represents a significant value proposition. Our Identifix
services play a unique, vital and growing role in the automotive ecosystem by helping to meet this
high-value need with proprietary data, technology and workflow optimization solutions.

With proprietary data covering more than 760,000 real world vehicle issues and growing every
day, we believe that our online subscription solutions deliver the most comprehensive, authoritative,
accurate and reliable information for vehicle service and repair in the world.

The primary source of the original fix data is our Identifix Repair Hotline, a pay-per-call technical
assistance service that connects professional automotive technicians across North America live with
ASE certified master mechanics who provide diagnostic services and repair guidance to service and
repair professionals. The information from Identifix Repair Hotline calls, including more than four million
inbound technical assistance calls over the last 26 years, is continually added to the database,
providing an ongoing source of new proprietary data regarding vehicle problems and the best way to fix
them, and further acting as a critical source of proprietary real-world fix data that keeps our solution
current, highly relevant and uniquely valuable to our customers.

133


-----

Supplementing the Identifix Repair Hotline data is content from a number of third party sources,
including most notably OEMs. Our solution synthesizes and categorizes authentic OEM-authored
information and factory manual content, and integrates this data to provide full 360-degree solutions for
vehicle problems of any type. With over 24 million documents from most major OEMs this authentic
OEM information supplements the real-world diagnostic data with factory-accurate protocols,
guidelines and diagrams governing how to repair diagnosed vehicle problems.

aftermarket repairs, serving over 50,000 rooftops and a network of over 270,000 automotive
technicians. Identifix processes over 20 million SMR events annually using a proprietary database
search functionality that covers approximately one million fixes.

**_Automotive Recycling Industry_**

The automotive recycling industry is highly fragmented. For example, there are $22 billion in
estimated annual sales in the U.S. market by more than 8,200 independent salvage and recycling
facilities. These facilities play an important role in the ecological and economical disposal and recycling
of inoperable motor vehicles. The automotive recycling industry is a valuable source of cost-effective
and often hard-to-find used vehicle replacement parts. Solera serves the automotive recycling industry
through Hollander and APU Solutions in North America and through Hollander International in Australia
and selected European countries.

Our data, software and services help customers to keep pace with more stringent buyer
requirements, increased government regulations and complexity of new vehicles. Additionally, some
insurance companies in some countries are mandating the use of aftermarket and recycled parts to
lower the costs to repair damaged vehicles. For example, in the United States, aftermarket and
recycled parts make up approximately 37% of parts usage in collision repair. We believe these factors
will result in increased demand for automotive recycling software and services, as recyclers seek to
manage their workflows, maximize the value of their inventories and increase efficiency. In many other
countries, use of recycled parts is still in the early development stages. Foreign buyers now account for
32% of vehicles purchased at salvage auctions.

**_Our Parts Solutions and Databases_**

Our InPart parts solution is the integration of parts procurement solutions from APU and DST.
Given its ability to integrate with the industry’s leading estimatics systems, body shop management
systems, mechanical shop management systems, and part suppliers’ inventory management systems,
InPart automates the entire parts procurement process, eliminating redundant or manual tasks for all
stakeholders, including insurers, shops, and parts suppliers.

For the collision repair market, InPart includes APU’s PartsNetwork, our web-based solution that
provides insurance adjusters and collision repair centers an automated process for sourcing, pricing
and purchasing alternative parts (second life, aftermarket or OEM surplus parts). Using PartsNetwork,
our customers process more than 103 million parts quotes, representing approximately $20.5 billion in
parts, annually. PartsNetwork provides real-time results for parts availability, description, quality, and
pricing thereby lowering costs for insurers, simplifying workflow for repairers, and driving sales for part
suppliers.

For the mechanical repair market, InPart incorporates DST’s eCommerce Gateway and Identifix’s
award-winning DirectHit mechanical repair support website. Together, they combine vehicle repair
information with real-time part information (e.g., pricing, availability), enabling users in over 53,000
repair shops to make intelligent purchasing decisions at the time of need.

**_Our Customer Retention Management Solutions and Databases_**

_Our Owner Solutions and Databases_

_Vehicle Insurance Re-Underwriting and Driver Monitoring._ Explore and LMI provide property
and casualty insurers with driver violation reporting services for a substantial number of their insured
drivers in the United States. This cost-effective service allows insurance companies to re-assess their
risk and, where appropriate, impose a premium surcharge on insured drivers to reflect such risk.
Through Explore, in the United States, we collect driver violation data from 129 sources in 47 states,
allowing for driver violation reporting on over 60 million insured drivers. This database collects over
34 million moving violation records annually.

_Electronic Titling._ Through TitleTec, we provide a driver information services platform that
allows automotive dealerships in the United States to streamline operations and improve the customer
purchasing experience by assembling and processing the data necessary to electronically register a

_Vehicle Validation._ Through HPI and CarweB, we provide private car buyers, car dealers,
finance houses and the insurance industry with access to information on all registered vehicles in the
United Kingdom. Using our vehicle validation database, private car buyers, car dealers, finance
companies and the insurance industry customers can verify who the owner is, whether there is a
finance-related lien, whether the vehicle has been recorded as stolen or if it has been declared a total
loss by an insurance company. We acquire data from a number of public and private data sources
including the Great Britain Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, motor dealers and manufacturers and
finance and insurance companies. The database contains information on approximately 108 million
vehicles (including 42 million vehicles currently licensed for use in the United Kingdom) and
approximately 179 million mileage readings. Through our access to the National Mileage Register, the
United Kingdom’s largest database of mileages, we can alert car buyers and dealers to potential
mileage discrepancies.

_CRM-SMR_

We enhance the service ecosystem by offering comprehensive vehicle inspection workflow
software with powerful data-driven tools and analytics, service center management and sales
solutions, and a suite of customer relationship management products for service centers to manage
and improve their relationships with vehicle owners. A core mission is to improve service center

vehicle purchases and 100% of the largest fleet, credit hire and leasing firms.

_Digital Content Applications_

We believe we are driving the digital transformation of assistive, contact driven apps to cognitive,
content rich experiences that will provide users with an all-inclusive means for both risk and asset
management of their most expensive assets, their automobiles and homes. This drive for delivering
global content will fuel synergistic value and usage into the contact driven platform solutions that
Solera is delivering today. One such content platform being developed and deployed globally is The
Digital Garage. The Digital Garage provides our customer’s customers with a single solution to
cognitively manage all aspects of their vehicle including valuation, personal cost of ownership, health,
service, maintenance, registration, inspection, insurance policy, repairs and claims, among others. It
digitally connects our customers (insurers, OEMs, repair facilities, service centers and banks, among
others) with their customers to deliver unrivaled value, brand differentiation and real-life relevance.

**Our Customers**

The primary participants in the automobile insurance claims processing industry with whom we do
business are automobile insurance companies, collision repair facilities, independent assessors and
automobile dealers, service, maintenance and repair facilities, and automotive recyclers, salvage, and
dealerships.

**_Automobile Insurance Companies_**

We estimate that the global automobile insurance industry processes more than 100 million
claims each year, representing more than $155 billion in repair, loss adjustment expense and other
related costs. We believe the industry is relatively concentrated with a number of large automobile
insurance companies accounting for the majority of global automobile insurance premiums. Over the
past decade, the largest insurers in the U.S., as a group, have been steadily growing and increasing

137


-----

their market share (measured by the premiums written) so that today over half of all private passenger
auto insurance in the United States is issued by just five companies, and in 2011, the top
15 companies issued more than 75 percent.

In 2014, global, non-life insurance premiums, which includes premiums for lines of business in
addition to automobile insurance, grew by 5.4% compared to 2013. In 2014, approximately 80.0% of
these premiums were generated in industrialized countries (of which North America grew by 2.7% and
Western Europe grew by 6.8% compared to 2013) and 20.0% of the premium volumes were generated
in emerging markets (of which Latin America grew by 6.0% and Emerging Asia grew by 11.1%
compared to 2013).

**_Collision Repair Facilities_**

The collision repair industry is highly fragmented. We estimate there are approximately 60,500
collision repair facilities in our markets. The operating costs of these facilities have increased
substantially over the past decade due to continued increases in sophisticated technologies and
advanced materials used in vehicle manufacture, inflation in collision repair labor rates and changes in
environmental regulations. In addition, collision repair facilities have increasingly established preferred
relationships with insurance companies. These arrangements, known in the United States as direct
repair programs, allow collision repair facilities to generate increased repair volumes through insurance
company referrals. Insurance companies benefit by establishing a trusted network of collision repair
facilities across which they can negotiate labor rates and implement standard procedures and best
practices. Insurance companies often require collision repair facilities to use specified automated
claims processing software and related services to participate in their programs. We believe the
combination of these factors will increase demand for software and services that help collision repair
facilities manage their workflow and increase their efficiency.

**_Independent Assessors_**

Independent assessors are often used to estimate vehicle repair costs, particularly where
automobile insurance companies have chosen not to employ their own assessors or do not have a
sufficient number of employee assessors and where governments mandate the use of independent
assessors.

In some markets, we believe changing government regulations and improved claims technology
will result in a decrease in the number of independent assessors. However, in other markets, insurance
companies are reducing their employee assessor staff to contain costs, which we believe will lead to a
growth in the number of independent assessors. We believe the combination of these offsetting factors
will result in a modest overall increase in the number of independent assessors and, therefore, the
demand for automobile insurance claims processing software and services.

**_Automobile Dealers_**

According to NADA, at the end of 2014, there were 16,396 new car dealerships in the United
States, down from 17,635 at the end of 2013, and down from 17,540 at the end of 2012.

**_Service, Maintenance and Repair Facilities_**

According to the North American Industry Classification system, there are approximately 275,000
chain and independent automobile repair facilities in the United States. These include service stations
and independent garages, car and light truck dealers, specialty repair shops (i.e., muffler, brakes, and
quick-lube shops), auto parts stores with bays, and discount stores/mass merchandisers.

138


-----

**_Automotive Recyclers, Salvage, Dealerships and Others_**

The automotive recycling industry is highly fragmented with, based on a 2014 industry study, over
$22 billion in estimated U.S. annual sales by over 8,200 independent salvage and recycling facilities.
Participants in the automotive recycling industry are a valuable source of economical and often hardto-find used vehicle replacement parts. Further this industry has become more sophisticated and
technology-driven in order to keep pace with more stringent fulfillment requirements. Additionally,
insurance companies are increasingly mandating the use of aftermarket and recycled parts to lower the
costs to repair damaged vehicles. Recycled parts in particular represent an economic and
environmental opportunity. In our company we call these recycled parts “second life” parts and we are
working with insurers, recyclers and governments to ensure a win-win outcome for all. We believe
these factors will result in increased demand for salvage yard management software and services, as
automotive recyclers seek to manage their workflows, maximize the value of their inventories and
increase efficiency.

**Our Acquisitions**

We have a disciplined acquisition strategy with an initial focus on Management, Margin and Core
(“MMC”) of the acquisition target followed by a Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”) analysis—targets
must generally meet both criteria. We seek acquisition targets with strong, entrepreneurial
management teams that can be incented to drive achievement of targets, often in conjunction with
performance based earn-outs. We seek acquisition targets that can achieve acceptable margin levels
within a reasonable amount of time. Finally, acquisition targets must have a strategic fit with our core
operations. Acquisition targets that meet our MMC hurdles are then subject to achievement of certain
ROIC thresholds.

We have completed 40 transactions since 2006, and the acquired targets had an average
adjusted EBITDA margin at the closing of each transaction of 35.5%, which improved to an average of
43.5% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Purchase multiple performance, defined as the
weighted average multiple paid at the closing of the transactions compared to the weighted average
invested capital multiple of EBITDA for the twelve months ended on the one-year anniversary of the
completion of the respective acquisition, was 12.7x at closing versus 11.0x for the last twelve months
ended December 31, 2015.

In general, our acquisition targets fall into the leverage, diversification or disruption categories of
our “LDD” growth strategy. Acquisition targets that fall into the leverage category generally either
provide us a claims footprint in a new geography or bring new claims related products that we can
distribute across our global claims platform. Acquisition targets that fall into the diversification category
generally provide us entry into non-claims related businesses that build on our auto, customer’s
customer or property platforms. Acquisition targets that fall into the disruption category provide us with
abilities that disrupt the market by connecting our platforms and enabling the digital lifestyles of our
customer’s customer.

**Our Global Operations**

We are active in over 75 countries on six continents. We manage our business operations
through two reportable segments: EMEA and Americas. Our EMEA reportable segment accounted for
approximately 47% of our revenues during fiscal year 2015. EMEA comprises our activities in
57 countries in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia. Our Americas reportable segment
accounted for approximately 53% of our revenues during fiscal year 2015. Americas comprises our
activities in 18 countries in North, Central and South America.

The table below sets forth the revenues we derived from the following geographic areas, based
on the location of the customer, during each of the previous three fiscal years:

**Fiscal Years Ended June 30,**
**(in thousands)** **2015** **2014** **2013**

United States . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $507,658 $368,151 $269,165
United Kingdom. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 155,972 116,334 101,815

The increase in the revenues derived from the United States market is primarily due to revenue
contributions from acquisitions, including SRS and I&S acquired in November 2013 and July 2014,
respectively. The increase in the revenues derived from the United Kingdom market is primarily due to
revenue contributions from acquisitions, including CAP.

**Sales and Marketing**

As of June 30, 2015, our sales and marketing staff included 665 professionals. Our sales and
marketing personnel identify and target specific sales opportunities and manage customer
relationships. They also design, plan, and launch strategies for new software and services, and plan
and facilitate customer conferences and trade shows. Our country managers are also involved in the
sales and marketing process, though they are not counted as full-time sales professionals.

**Customer Support and Training**

We believe that providing high quality customer support and training services is critical to our
success. As of June 30, 2015, we had 568 customer support and training personnel, who provide
telephone support, as well as on- and off-site implementation and training. Our customer support and
training staff generally consists of individuals with expertise in both our software and services and in
the automobile insurance and/or collision repair industries.

**Software and Database Development**

We devote significant resources to the continued development of our software and databases.
We have created sophisticated processes and tools to achieve high-quality software development and
data accuracy. Our ability to maintain and grow our leading position in the automobile insurance claims
processing industry is dependent upon our ability to enhance and broaden the scope of our software
and services, as well as continuing to expand and improve our repair estimating, total loss, claims,
vehicle validation, motor vehicle record and parts salvage databases. We often collaborate with our
customers in the development process to focus on addressing their specific needs. We then
incorporate what we have learned from our customers’ workflow experiences and needs to deliver
quality, workflow-oriented software and services to the marketplace quickly. We believe these efforts
provide a significant competitive advantage in the development of new software and services.

As of June 30, 2015, our software development staff consisted of 958 professionals across three
international software development centers and our database staff consisted of 366 professionals
across eight international database development centers.

**Competition**

We compete primarily on the value and functionality of our software and services, the integrity
and breadth of our data, customer service and price. The competitive dynamics of the global

143


-----

automobile insurance claims processing industry vary by region, and our competitors are present in a
subset of markets in which we operate. In Europe, our largest competitors include DAT GmbH,
EurotaxGlass’s Group and GT Motive Einsa Group, with whom we compete in multiple countries. In
North America, our largest competitors include CCC Information Services Inc. in the U.S. and Mitchell
International Inc. in the U.S. and Canada. We also encounter regional or country-specific competition
in the markets for automobile insurance claims processing software and services and our
complementary products and services. For example, Experian is our principal competitor in the United
Kingdom in the vehicle validation market, and car.tv is our principal competitor in Germany in the
online salvage vehicle disposition market and, as a result of our acquisition of Explore, ChoicePoint is
our principal competitor in the U.S. in the automobile re-underwriting solutions market. The principal
competitors of Identifix in the U.S. service, repair and maintenance software and solutions market are
ALLDATA and the Mitchell1 repair manuals. The principal competitor of I&S in the U.S specializing in
glass claims is Safelite. CAP’s competitors in the valuation and specifications of new and used cars are
Kee Resources and Glass’s Guide.

**Intellectual Property and Licenses**

We enter into license agreements with our customers, granting each customer a license to use
our software and services while ensuring the protection of our ownership and the confidentiality of the
embedded information and technology contained in our software. As a general practice, employees,
contractors and other parties with access to our confidential information sign agreements that prohibit
the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information and technology.

We own registered trademarks and service marks that we use in connection with our software
and services, including their advertising and marketing. For example, our trademark Audatex is
registered in over 50 countries.

We license much of the data used in our software and services through short-term contracts with
third parties, including contracts with OEMs, aftermarket parts suppliers, data aggregators, automobile
dealerships and vehicle repair facilities, to whom we pay royalties.

**Employees**

As of June 30, 2015, we had 5,442 associates, including 2,025 employees in our EMEA
reportable segment, 3,312 employees in our Americas reportable segment, and 105 employees in
corporate roles. Certain of our employees outside of the United States are subject to a collective
bargaining agreement or works council arrangement.

**Business Strategy**

Our LDD growth strategy is a framework for innovation and sustained, scalable growth.

Leverage refers to expanding our geographic footprint to increase the number of claims we
process and to increase the number of services we provide in each claim to drive incremental return on
investment for our insurance customers. Once a new market begins to adopt our electronic claims
processing solutions and as our revenue-per-claim increases as we provide higher returns on
investment to our customers, we enjoy scale benefits associated with our business model.

As our penetration of electronic claims processing increases in a geography, we begin to diversify
to add more services to our auto platform as well as our customer’s customer and property platforms.
These diversifications add to our growth opportunities while diversifying from a reliance on collisionrelated claims.

144


-----

Our current focus is to disrupt the market by connecting our platforms and enabling the digital
lifestyles of our customer’s customer. Thus, we envision the auto as another smart appliance within the
home and with the owners looking to use digital tools to manage their auto and home ownership
experiences including purchase, maintenance and accident repair. Recent horizontal and vertical
expansion of our platforms also provides us with an opportunity to increase portfolio bundling of our
offerings and opportunities to cross-sell additional solutions to our existing and new customers to
derive more revenue per customer and leverage core strengths of our platform.

We plan to execute our strategy while continuously improving productivity and eliminating waste.
We have historically demonstrated a consistent track record of profitable growth and waste reduction.
Between fiscal year 2007 and 2014, we achieved approximately $95 million in waste reduction. Midway
through fiscal year 2015, we announced that we raised our target to $30 to $40 million in annualized
synergies and waste reduction, of which half was realized during the remainder of fiscal year 2015.
Additionally, we have improved margins in existing and acquired business via standard continuous
productivity improvement and waste elimination practices. For example, for 38 out of 40 fiscal quarters
prior to our purchase of AutoPoint, AutoPoint generated a negative EBITDA margin. AutoPoint’s
EBITDA margin has remained positive and significantly improved during our ownership.

Going forward, we plan to increase our focus on high margin products and services, while
focusing on our cost savings plan, including the elimination of public company costs and ongoing
waste elimination practices.

**Our Markets**

We categorize each of the over 75 countries in which we are active into one of the three following
market types (from most digitized to least): (i) Advanced; (ii) Evolving; and (iii) Emerging.

**Market Type** **Market Characteristics**

**Advanced Market** ‰ Advanced Markets include the United States, Canada, Western Europe and
Japan.

‰ Digitized claims processing is widespread among industry participants.

‰ Vehicle insurance is generally government-mandated and a condition to
obtaining vehicle financing.

‰ Number of cars on the road (“car parc”) growing at a lower rate relative to other
market types.

**Evolving Market** ‰ Evolving Markets include Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe.

‰ Increasing adoption from manual claims processing to digitized claims
processing; limited use of automated claims processing by industry
participants.

‰ Higher accident frequencies than advanced markets.

‰ Growing adoption of government-mandated vehicle insurance and insurance
as a condition to vehicle financing.

‰ Size of car parc increasing.

**Emerging Market** ‰ Emerging Markets include China, India and Morocco

‰ Insurance companies focused on underwriting policies and establishing market
share.

145


-----

**Market Type** **Market Characteristics**

‰ Substantial majority of claims are manually processed; significant opportunity
for industry participants to increase operational efficiency through the adoption
of automated claims processing.

‰ Early stage adoption of government-mandated vehicle insurance and insurance
as a condition to vehicle financing.

‰ The highest accident frequencies among the three market types.

‰ Size of car parc increasing at the fastest rate among the three market types.

**Growth in our Markets**

The primary growth drivers for our industry are the number insurance claims made, as well as the
size, growth and age of the car parc. The increase in overall size and age of the car parc drives need
for vehicle service, maintenance and repair along with customer retention tools for our customers, in
addition, the frequency of collisions drives the number of insurance claims made.

Management estimates the global number of automotive claims will reach approximately
165 million for 2020, growing at a CAGR of 6.3% from the 2015 estimate of approximately 122 million
claims.

The chart below depicts the global annual historical and projected vehicle unit sales in millions for
Advanced Markets and the rest of the world.

Advanced(US,Canada,Western Europe,and Japan) Rest of the World

According to industry sources, global new light vehicle sales grew by 4.0% in 2014 to 90.0 million
units and sales are forecasted to reach 92.2 million units, up by 2.5%, in 2015. In Advanced Markets,
sales are projected to grow at a 1.0% CAGR from 2014 through 2024. In other markets, sales are
projected to grow at a 6.0% CAGR from 2014 through 2024. Fewer new light vehicle sales can result in
fewer insured vehicles on the road and fewer automobile accidents, which can reduce the transactionbased fees that we generate.

146


-----

The industry sources also estimate that the average age of vehicles is increasing across the
globe. In the United States, the average age of vehicles is 11.4 years, an increase of 1.5% CAGR
since 2003. In Emerging Markets, the average age of vehicles is increasing at a faster pace. For
example, in China the average age of vehicles is expected to be 5 years in 2016, growing at a CAGR
of 4.0% from 2011 to 2016.

2011 2016E


Another growth driver is the insurance industry focus on increasing claims processing efficiency
and reducing claims cost severity. Digitalizing claims processing can result in significant cost savings,
improved cycle time, customer experience and agility for insurers. Based on a study from a leading
consulting firm commissioned by Solera, currently 30% of claims processes at insurers account for
80% of the time of their full time employees, with significant potential to increase digitalization.

The cost of digitized claims processing software and services generally represents a relatively
small portion of automobile insurance companies’ claims costs. We believe automobile insurance
companies will increase their spending on digitized claims processing software and services that
improve their customers experience because such incremental investments can result in significant
cost reductions and customer satisfaction improvements.

Each of these factors influences industry growth differently in our three market types, as detailed
below.

**_Advanced Markets._** In our Advanced Markets, automobile insurance is generally governmentmandated and claims processing is generally automated. Automobile insurance companies achieve
growth in these highly competitive markets by gaining additional market share and generally compete
on price, quality and range of policyholder service. To remain competitive, insurance companies
increasingly seek additional automated claims processing products and services to minimize costs and
improve policyholder service. In these markets, the car parc is stable. For example, in the United
States, the number of registered vehicles declined in 2012 and increased in 2013 and 2014, while the
average vehicle age has been increasing.

The chart below depicts the number of light vehicle registrations in the United States (20022015E).

230.5 235.2 239.2 243.0 246.3 249.3 251.9 252.2 249.4 249.5 248.7 248.8 252.6 257.9

Vehicle Registrations (in millions)

_Source: Autocare Association Factbook (2016)_

As vehicles become more complex, it results in an increase in claim severity and a higher RpC,
which we define as the total revenue derived from vehicle collision claims in advanced markets divided
by the number of such claims. For example, in our Advanced Markets (Western Europe for RpC), RpC
grew from $25.64 for the three months ended December 31, 2013 to $28.24 for the three months
ended December 31, 2015.

147


-----

**_Evolving Markets._** In our Evolving Markets, the car parc is generally growing. Automobile
insurance companies achieve growth in these markets by focusing on writing new vehicle insurance
policies and increasing market share. A significant number of claims are processed manually in these
markets, presenting opportunities for insurance companies to increase their operational efficiencies by
automating claims processing.

**_Emerging Markets._** In our Emerging Markets, the car parc is growing at the fastest rate among
the three market types. Automobile insurance companies achieve growth in these markets by focusing
on writing new vehicle insurance policies and increasing market share. The vast majority of claims are
processed manually or using homegrown solutions in these markets, presenting opportunities for
insurance companies to increase their operational efficiencies by digitizing claims processing and
leveraging global OEM data and repair methods.

**Competitive Strengths**

**_Leading Global Market Position._** We are a leading provider of risk and asset management
software and services to the automotive and property marketplace, including the global property and
casualty insurance industry. We have a presence in more than 75 countries across six continents and
a leading global business portfolio as detailed below:

Automobile Claims Processing ‰ Number one global provider of automobile claims processing

‰ A global leader in glass claims

Property Claims ‰ Emerging player in automated claims handling

Service, Maintenance and Repair ‰ Number one U.S. provider of experienced-based repair
solutions

Automobile Parts ‰ A leading North American provider of electronic parts
exchanges

Owner ‰ U.S. leading provider of driver event monitoring

‰ U.K. leading provider of vehicle validation

CRM-SMR ‰ Largest integrated CRM retention system in North America

Vehicle Valuation ‰ U.K. industry standard for valuation data

‰ One of the leading providers of valuations to the U.S.
insurance industry

We believe that the large number of geographic regions in which we operate provides a strategic
advantage when expanding into new markets by enabling us to utilize our databases and vehicle
coverage already present in adjacent or nearby markets.

**_Proprietary Databases that are Difficult to Replicate._** We believe that our proprietary
databases pose barriers to entry due to the significant capital investment and time that would be
required to develop a similar set of integrated databases and customize them for use in local markets.
Our proprietary databases have been built over 45 years of developing, collecting, organizing and
managing automobile-related information and data. Over the last five years, we have invested over
$100 million annually, including $135 million in fiscal year 2015, to maintain and expand our proprietary
databases and related software applications, including customizing our databases for use in local

148


-----

markets. Our databases cover more than 98% of the vehicles on the road today in our core markets
dating back to 1970. Our databases empower our clients to achieve measurably better outcomes,
through increased efficiency in the claims management and collision repair processes.

**_Strongly positioned to capitalize on market opportunities._** We are a global market leader in
the automotive insurance claim industry. We believe that our leadership in data, software and
networking across platforms and our loyal customer base will enable us to take advantage of our digital
content platform enhanced by favorable trends in our industry. The global automotive insurance
industry has focused on claims processing efficiency and reducing claims cost severity through
digitalization, as the number of claims processed each year is expected to increase to 165 million by
2020, from over 100 million currently. Additionally, more cars and an aging car parc will increase
demand for our SMR and CRM platforms, as the global car parc is expected to increase to 1.5 billion
cars by year 2020 (from 1.2 billion currently) and as the average vehicle stays longer on the road
(average age of a vehicle in the United States has increased to 11.4 years in 2014, from 9.7 years in
2003). Our next generation Digital Content Applications will connect all of our platforms to disrupt and
proliferate the digital lifecycle experience of our customer’s customer as we take our core competency
from the auto to the home.

**_Long-term Relationships with a Large and Diverse Customer Base._** We serve over 195,000
customers in more than 75 countries across six continents. We derive revenues from many of the
world’s largest automobile insurance companies, including the ten largest automobile insurance
companies in Europe and eight of the ten largest automobile insurance companies in North America.
No single customer accounted for more than 3.0% and 2.9% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2015 and for the six months ended December 31, 2015, respectively.

**_High Visibility from Recurring Revenue Base._** A substantial portion of our revenues are
derived from customers who have used our software and services for many years. Our customer
retention is very high because of long-standing customer relationships and the integration of our claims
processing software and services into our customers’ systems. In addition, we have subscription-based
or transaction-based contracts with many of our customers. As a result, 97% of our revenues in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were recurring.

**_Strong and Steady Financial Performance._** We have grown our revenues and Adjusted
EBITDA consistently every year, at a revenue CAGR of 11.4% and an Adjusted EBITDA CAGR of
15.6% since fiscal 2006. We have attractive operating margins and moderate working capital
requirements that we believe drive strong free cash flow generation relative to other enterprise
software companies. We have expanded our Adjusted EBITDA margins from 28.9% in 2006 to 38.3%
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, reflecting, among other things, increased operating
leverage and cost saving initiatives while continuing our expansion in both Evolving Markets and
Emerging Markets. Moreover, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our Free Cash Flow
conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA) was 83.8%. See note
(9) to “—Summary Consolidated Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data” for the definition of Free
Cash Flow.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our RMS, SMR and CRM platform revenues
were 53%, 14% and 33%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the three months ended
December 31, 2015, the three months ended September 30, 2015 and the fiscal years ended June 30,
2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, our organic growth rate on a constant currency basis was 6.3%,
7.3%, 6.4%, 4.4%, 3.8%, 4.9% and 5.6%, respectively, while our total growth rate (including
acquisitions) on a constant currency basis was 16.3%, 21.9%, 22.6%, 16.8%, 8.5%, 17.4% and 8.1%
for those periods, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2015, the three months
ended September 30, 2015 and the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, our

Americas organic growth rate on a constant currency basis was 7.0%, 10.3%, 6.9%, 4.4%, 4.9%, 5.2%
and 5.2%, respectively, and our EMEA organic growth rate on a constant currency basis was 5.5%,
4.1%, 6.0%, 4.4%, 3.0%, 4.7% and 5.9% for those periods, respectively. For the three months
ended December 31, 2015, the three months ended September 30, 2015 and the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, our non-RMS organic growth rate on a constant currency
basis was 8.6%, 10.8%, 11.0%, 4.8%, 3.6%, 5.5% and 10.5%, respectively, while our RMS organic
growth rate on a constant currency basis was 4.6%, 5.5%, 3.8%, 4.3%, 3.8%, 4.7% and 4.4% for those
periods, respectively. Our organic growth rate, EMEA organic growth rate and non-RMS organic
growth rate for the three months ended December 31, 2015 have been normalized to account for the
one-time impact of our acquisition of CAP Automotive, which closed in mid-November 2014. Our
organic growth rate, Americas organic growth rate and RMS organic growth rate for the three months
ended September 30, 2015 have been normalized to account for the one-time impact of our acquisition
of I&S, which closed on July 29, 2014.

**_Strong and Experienced Management Team._** We have a deep and experienced senior
management team. This team is led by our founder, chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tony
Aquila, who has over 25 years of experience in the industry. Mr. Aquila’s vision has driven us to
consistently grow and achieve increased profitability during his tenure. Our ability to continuously
improve profitability and strong financial management is led by our Chief Financial Officer, Renato
Giger. Mr. Giger has been with our Company and the Audatex business for more than 20 years.

joining Vista, Mr. Sowul worked in the High Technology Group at Goldman, Sachs & Co. where he
advised clients in a variety of verticals including software, Internet and media, direct broadcast satellite,
IT services, and telecom equipment, among others. These projects included buy-side and sell-side
transactions, public market financings and other strategic advisory initiatives. Mr. Sowul also worked at
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, where he focused on high technology M&A investment banking, and at
Generation Partners, a venture capital firm focused on technology investments. He received a B.S. in
Economics from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and a B.S. in Engineering from
School of Engineering of the University of Pennsylvania.

**Board Structure and Committee Composition**

After consummation of the Transactions, our Board of Directors may establish from time to time
committees that it deems necessary and advisable. We intend to determine the composition of any
such committees of the Board following consummation of the Transactions.

**Agreements with Executive Officers**

After the Merger, we expect to continue to compensate our senior management on a basis
substantially similar to immediately prior to the Merger, except that, in light of our status as a private
company, our equity-based incentive programs will be different and may be less broad-based than
those utilized by us prior to the Merger. As a result, our cash compensation cost likely will be higher.

**Employment Agreements**

We are party to employment agreements with certain management employees, which in some
cases provide for severance in the event of certain terminations of employment. In connection with the
Merger, we or one of our affiliates anticipate entering into new employment agreements with certain of
our executive officers on terms to be agreed between us or one of our affiliates and the executives.

**Equity-Based Arrangements**

In connection with the closing of the Transactions, we expect to adopt an equity incentive plan
designed to provide incentives to such present and future employees, directors, officers, consultants or
advisors of Parent or its subsidiaries, as may be selected in the sole discretion of Parent’s Board of
Directors. This plan will allow for the grant of stock options. We anticipate that the awards will generally
vest based on a combination of continued service and the achievement of performance objectives. The
total percentage of equity to be reserved for issuance under the equity incentive plans has not yet been
determined. The final equity arrangements may contain terms that allow us to purchase equity from
plan participants following a termination of their employment for cash.

**Cash-Based Incentive Arrangements**

From time to time, we anticipate adopting cash-based incentive-based arrangements to
compensate our management and other employees.

**Retention Bonuses**

We established a cash-based retention program that provides for awards up to an aggregate
amount of $33 million to promote retention and incentivize efforts to consummate the Transactions.

152


-----

Under the retention program, each participant will be eligible to receive 100% of the award on closing
of the Merger (or, in the case of Mr. Aquila, 50% of the award will be payable on August 22, 2016 if the
Merger has not closed by such date) or upon the participant’s qualifying termination prior to the closing
of the Merger.

**Pension Plans**

Our foreign subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension plans and individual defined
benefit arrangements covering certain eligible employees. The benefits under these pension plans are
based on years of service and compensation levels. Funding is limited to statutory requirements. We
have a qualifying 401(k) defined contribution plan that covers most of our domestic employees and
provides matching contributions under various formulas. Our foreign subsidiaries have defined
contribution plans that cover certain international employees and provide matching contributions under
various formulas.

**Sarbanes-Oxley Act Considerations**

As a privately held company following the consummation of the Transactions, we will not be
subject to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Thus, we may not have comparable internal
control and corporate governance procedures in place as compared to public companies.

153


-----

**SECURITY OWNERSHIP**

Following the consummation of the Transactions, Solera will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Issuers and all or substantially all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Issuers will be
beneficially owned by certain funds affiliated with Vista and other investors. All members of our Board
of Directors affiliated with Vista may be deemed to beneficially own shares owned by such entities.
Each such individual disclaims beneficial ownership of any such shares in which such individual does
not have a pecuniary interest.

154


-----

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Arrangements with Vista and its Affiliates**
Merger Sub and certain subsidiaries or parent companies, including Parent, have entered or
expect to enter into various related party agreements in the ordinary course of business and in
contemplation of the Transactions, to which Solera will succeed by operation of law as a result of the
Transactions.

**Stockholders Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement**
In connection with the Transactions, we expect that affiliates of Vista and certain other coinvestors will enter into a stockholders agreement with Parent, which we expect to provide for, among
other things, the election of the board of directors of Parent, restrictions on the transferability of equity
of Parent, preemptive rights, bring-along rights, tag-along rights, preemptive rights and information
rights for the benefit of Vista and certain other co-investors.

In addition, in connection with the Transactions, we expect that affiliates of Vista and certain other
co-investors will enter into a registration rights agreement with Parent, pursuant to which we expect to
provide certain holders of registrable securities, at any time after a qualified public offering, with certain
“demand” registration rights, as well as customary “piggyback” registration rights that will be available
to all holders of registrable securities. We also expect this registration rights agreement to provide that
Parent will pay certain expenses relating to such registrations, excluding underwriting discounts and
commissions, and indemnify such holders and their affiliates against certain liabilities which may arise
under the Securities Act with any offering made pursuant to such registration rights.

**Sponsor Management Agreement**
In connection with the Transactions, we expect that Parent will enter into a management
agreement with Vista Consulting Group (“VCG”) relating to certain management and consulting
services VCG will provide to Parent. Under the management agreement, VCG is entitled to
reimbursement for its reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with its
services provided. The management agreement will provide that Parent must indemnify VCG and its
affiliates against all losses, claims, damages and liabilities arising out of or related to the performance
by VCG or its affiliates of services thereunder, and will remain in effect until terminated in writing by the
parties thereto.

**Series A Preferred Stock**
Concurrently with the consummation of the Transactions, Parent will issue shares of Series A
Preferred Stock having an aggregate stated value of $800.0 million. The shares of Series A Preferred
Stock will be equity instruments with no voting rights except in limited circumstances. The shares will
accumulate cumulative dividends on a daily basis in arrears during each dividend period on the thencurrent stated value of each share of Series A Preferred Stock. Dividends will be payable quarterly in
kind, and unpaid dividends will be added to the stated value of each share of Series A Preferred Stock.
Parent will make customary representations and warranties in connection with the issuance of the
Series A Preferred Stock, and Parent and its subsidiaries, including the Issuers and their restricted
subsidiaries, will be subject to affirmative and negative covenants under agreements associated with
the Series A Preferred Stock that will not be more restrictive than the indenture that will govern the
notes offered hereby or the credit agreement that will govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The
shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be perpetual, subject, after 11 years, to certain forced sale and
public offering rights. Parent will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Series A Preferred
Stock upon the occurrence of (i) the liquidation, bankruptcy or insolvency of Parent or a material
subsidiary of Parent, including Solera, (ii) a change of control of Parent or (iii) an acceleration of the
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other material indebtedness of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, including Solera, coupled with the request of the applicable holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock.

155


-----

**Series B Preferred Stock**
Concurrently with the consummation of the Transactions, Parent will issue shares of Series B
Preferred Stock having an aggregate stated value of $250.0 million. The shares of Series B Preferred
Stock will be equity instruments with no voting rights, except in limited circumstances. The shares will
accumulate cumulative dividends on a daily basis in arrears during each dividend period on the thencurrent stated value of each share of Series B Preferred Stock. Dividends will be payable semiannually in kind, and unpaid dividends will be added to the stated value of each share of Series B
Preferred Stock. Parent will make customary representations and warranties in connection with the
issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock, and Parent and its subsidiaries, including the Issuers and
their Restricted Subsidiaries, will be subject to affirmative and negative covenants under agreements
associated with the Series B Preferred Stock that will not be more restrictive than the indenture that will
govern the notes offered hereby or the credit agreement that will govern the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be perpetual, subject, after ten years, to certain,
forced sale and public offering rights. Parent will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Series
B Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of (i) the liquidation, bankruptcy or insolvency of Parent or a
material subsidiary of Parent, including Solera, (ii) upon a change of control of Parent or (iii) an
acceleration of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other material indebtedness of Parent
or any of its subsidiaries, including Solera, coupled with the request of the applicable holders of the
Series B Preferred Stock.

**Related Party Transactions Policy and Procedure**
Our legal and finance departments are primarily responsible for developing and implementing
processes and controls to obtain information from our directors, executive officers and significant
stockholders regarding related party transactions and then determining, based on the facts and
circumstances, whether we or a related party has a direct or indirect material interest in our
transactions. In accordance with our Conflict of Interest and Code of Conduct Policy, our Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for the review, approval or ratification of
“related-person transactions” between us or our subsidiaries and related parties. In accordance with
our Audit Committee Charter, our Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring “related-person
transactions” approved or ratified by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. “Related
party” refers to a person or entity that is, or at any point since the beginning of the previous fiscal year
was, a director, officer, nominee for director, or 5% stockholder of us, or the immediate family
members of such a person or entity. We do not have a written policy regarding the approval of related
party transactions but the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will apply its review
procedures to potential related-person transactions as a part of its standard operating procedures. In
the course of their duties in reviewing, approving, ratifying and monitoring a related-party transaction,
our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Audit Committee, as appropriate, will
consider:
‰ the nature of the related party’s interest in the transaction;
‰ the material terms of the transaction, including, the amount involved and type of transaction;
‰ the importance of the transaction to the related party and to us;
‰ whether the transaction would impair the judgment of a director or executive officer to act in our
best interest and the best interest of our stockholders; and
‰ any other matters our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or Audit Committee
deems appropriate.

Any member of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or Audit Committee who
is a related party with respect to a transaction under review may not participate in the deliberations or
vote on the approval or ratification of the transaction. However, such a director may be counted in
determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of our Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee or Audit Committee at which the transaction is considered. Except as set forth below, since

156


-----

July 1, 2011, we have not been a party to, and we have no plans to be a party to, any transaction or
series of similar transactions in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000 and in
which any current director, executive officer, holder of more than 5% of our capital stock, or any
member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing, had or will have a direct or indirect material
interest, other than in connection with the transactions described below.

**Aquila Guest Ranch**

Aquila Guest Ranch, LLC (“AGR”), an entity owned by the family of Mr. Aquila, owns a working
guest ranch in Wyoming. Mr. Aquila and AGR have supported our development by hosting numerous
events at the ranch and, at AGR’s expense, renovating several facilities on the premises. The ranch
has been used for various company-related purposes, including: functions intended to foster client,
partner and vendor relations as well as business and corporate development; global employee training
and team building; management retreats; and employee excellence awards.

Prior to February 11, 2013, we used the ranch without charge. The Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee has determined that our use of the ranch in the past and going forward has
been and is beneficial to our business. On February 11, 2013, the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee approved entering into a Facilities Use Agreement and an Indemnification
Agreement between us and AGR, which agreements govern our use of the ranch.

Under the Facilities Use Agreement, we paid AGR a fixed annual fee of $140,000 (the “Fee”) for
use of the facilities during calendar year 2013. The fee was determined by multiplying the estimated
daily operating costs of the ranch by an assumed number of days that we will use the ranch, which use
is based on our historical and expected future use. In approving the amount of the fee, the Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee and the independent members of the Board considered the
rates charged by comparable third-party facilities in the vicinity of the ranch and determined that the
Fee is lower than the amounts we would pay for the use of such comparable facilities.

The Facilities Use Agreement automatically renews on an annual basis unless either party
provides the other party 30 days written notice of termination. Under the Facilities Use Agreement, we
are also obligated to pay out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with, and replenish expendable
goods used as a result of, our use of the ranch. The Indemnification Agreement provides that we will
indemnify AGR and certain other indemnitees for any claims, demands, causes of action and damages
that may arise out of our use of the ranch.

In accordance with the Audit Committee’s charter, the Audit Committee will periodically, and at
least annually, review our use of the ranch, the Fee, the Facilities Use Agreement and the
Indemnification Agreement.

On December 26, 2013, we entered into an amendment to the Facilities Use Agreement with
AGR and Chaparral Lane Investment, LLC (“CLI”), an entity owned by our Mr. Aquila and his family, to
(i) add an additional facility in Roanoke, Texas to the Facilities Use Agreement and (ii) increase the
fixed annual fee to $170,000 in exchange for our use during calendar year 2014 of the Wyoming
Facility. This fee increase is due to increased operating expenses of the Wyoming Facility and an
increase in the number of days during which we use the Wyoming Facility. On December 31, 2014, we
executed another amendment to the Facilities Use Agreement to: (i) increase the fixed annual fee paid
by us to AFV for our use of the Wyoming Facility to $272,250, and (ii) provide for a true-up payment by
us to AFV to the extent that our actual use of the Wyoming Facility during a calendar year exceeds the
assumed use for that calendar year, which assumed use was a basis for the fixed annual fee. The trueup payments paid by us to AFV for calendar years 2014 and 2015 were $63,270 and $101,640,
respectively. On April 7, 2015, we entered into a third amendment to the Facilities Use Agreement

157


-----

whereby the Roanoke Facility and CLI were removed from the Facilities Use Agreement in connection
with our entry into a lease agreement (the “Lease Agreement”) covering the Roanoke Facility (also
known as the “Innovation Center” (as defined below)).

**Innovation Center**

On April 7, 2015, we and CLI entered into the Lease Agreement whereby we lease from CLI a
property owned by CLI in Roanoke, Texas (the “Innovation Center”). The Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee approved the lease on April 1, 2015.

We use the Innovation Center for various purposes, including: research and development; global
employee meetings, training and team building; and functions intended to foster client, partner and
vendor relations as well as business and corporate development. We have been using the Innovation
Center prior to April 7, 2015 pursuant to the terms of the Facilities Use Agreement and on after April 7,
2015 pursuant to the Lease Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Facilities Use Agreement, we
were the primary user of the Innovation Center, and we did not pay any fees for such use.

We have collaborated with CLI on the development of the Innovation Center, creating a unique
property that is custom-tailored to our use of the Innovation Center, including product and technology
innovation efforts. We believe that the outputs generated from our use of the Innovation Center have
contributed and will continue to contribute to the improvement of our results of operations. Mr. Aquila
has invested approximately $1.5 million in the Innovation Center, including payment of the purchase
price for the property, and we have invested approximately $6.2 million in the Innovation Center, as of
December 31, 2015, primarily for property improvements. All of our investments prior to April 7, 2015 in
the Innovation Center have been made in accordance with the Facilities Use Agreement and all our
investments on or after April 7, 2015 in the Innovation Center have been made in accordance with the
Lease Agreement.

To provide us with continued, exclusive, long-term rights to use the Innovation Center and to
protect our investment in the improvements to the Innovation Center, the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee approved the Lease Agreement. The material terms of the Lease Agreement
are described below.

‰ Term: The term of the Lease Agreement is 20 years. We have an option (the “Option”) to
extend the lease for an additional 5-year term immediately following expiration of the initial 20year term (the “Option Term”).

‰ Payment Obligations: The monthly lease payment is $10,000. The monthly lease payment is
determined by multiplying Mr. Aquila’s invested capital in the Innovation Center ($1.5 million)
by 0.08 and dividing this product by twelve. Based on the unique nature of the Innovation
Center and our discussions with commercial real estate professionals in the Dallas-Fort Worth
metroplex regarding commercial lease rates in the vicinity of the Innovation Center, the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that our monthly lease payment to
CLI is not above current market rates. The monthly lease payment is subject to adjustment in
accordance with a consumer price index after year 5, year 10, year 15 and, if we exercise the
Option, year 20. We are also responsible for property taxes, maintenance and insurance for the
Innovation Center.

‰ Termination of the Lease by Us: We can terminate the Lease Agreement during the initial
10 years of the lease term, following two years’ prior notice; during years 11—15 of the lease
term, following one year’s prior notice; and after year 15 of the lease term, following 90 day’s
prior notice. During the Option Term (if we exercise the Option), we can terminate the Lease
Agreement following one year’s prior notice.

‰ Termination of the Lease by CLI: CLI can terminate the Lease Agreement following an
uncured breach of the Lease Agreement by us.

158


-----

‰ Termination of the Lease by Either Party: Either party may terminate the Lease Agreement
following certain catastrophic events, such as fire at or condemnation of the Innovation Center.

‰ Assignment of the Lease Agreement by Us: We may assign the Lease Agreement or sublet
the Innovation Center with CLI’s prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.

‰ CLI’s Right to Transfer: CLI has the right to transfer its interests in the Innovation Center.

‰ Our Option to Purchase the Innovation Center: In the event CLI decides to sell the Innovation
Center during the initial Lease term or the Option Term, we have the right to purchase the
Innovation Center from CLI at the Offer Price (as defined below). The “Offer Price” during the
initial Lease term is (i) $1,500,000 plus (ii) an amount that delivers to CLI interest on
$1,500,000 at an annual rate equal to 10% compounded monthly from and after April 7, 2015
to the time of settlement for the purchase (the “Settlement Date”) less (iii) the aggregate
monthly lease payments received by CLI through the Settlement Date (the “Received Rent”)
adjusted to the present value of the Received Rent at an annual interest rate equal to 10%
compounded monthly from and after the applicable payment date to the Settlement Date (the
“Offer Price Formula”). The “Offer Price” during the Option Term shall be an amount equal to
the greater of the price derived from the Offer Price Formula and the price set forth in a written
offer to purchase the Innovation Center delivered by a bona fide third party to CLI.

Concurrent with the execution of the Lease Agreement, the parties to the Facilities Use
Agreement executed an amendment to the Facilities Use Agreement removing all of the parties’ going
forward rights and obligations relating to the Innovation Center.

**Software and Services Arrangements**

Certain minority stockholders of our international subsidiaries are also commercial purchasers
and users of our software and services. Revenue transactions with all of the minority stockholders in
the aggregate were less than 10% of our consolidated revenue for fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015
and for the six months ended December 31, 2015, respectively, and aggregate accounts receivable
from the noncontrolling stockholders represent less than 10% of consolidated accounts receivable at
June 30, 2014 and 2015, and for the six months ended December 31, 2015, respectively.

**Indemnification Agreements**

Following the Effective Time, Solera will indemnify and Parent will cause Solera to indemnify,
each of the current and former directors, officers and employees of Solera or our subsidiaries to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law against costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’
fees) incurred in connection with claims, whether asserted before or after the Effective Time, arising
out of or related to such person’s service as one of our directors, officers or employees or as a director,
officer or employee of one of our subsidiaries. For a period of six years following the Effective Time, we
will maintain in effect the director, officer and employee exculpation, indemnification and advancement
of expenses provisions in our and our subsidiaries’ organizational documents.

159

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

Below is a description of certain terms of our New Term Loan Facility and our New Revolving
Facility.

**New Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

In connection with the Transactions, we expect to enter into the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities with a syndicate of financial institutions led by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative
agent and collateral agent, having the terms described below.

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities consist of a $1,500.0 million Dollar term loan facility
(the “Dollar Term Loan Facility”) maturing in 2023, a $700.0 million equivalent Euro term loan facility
(the “Euro Term Loan Facility”) maturing in 2023 and a $300.0 million New Revolving Facility maturing
in 2021. The New Revolving Facility will include a subfacility for letters of credit and a swingline
subfacility. The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will also include an uncommitted incremental

amortize in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the original
principal amount of the New Term Loan Facility, with the balance payable on the maturity date for the
New Term Loan Facility.

**_Interest Rates and Fees_**

The Dollar Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility will each bear interest on the
outstanding unpaid principal amount at a rate equal to an applicable margin (discussed below) plus, at

_Street Journal as the prime lending rate at such time, (ii) 0.50% in excess of the overnight_
federal funds rate at such time and (iii) the LIBOR rate that would then be in effect for a
LIBOR loan with an interest period of one month plus 1%;

Revolving Facility will be 4.50% per annum (for LIBOR loans) and 3.50% per annum (for base rate

commitments under the New Revolving Facility, of 0.50% per annum. We will also be required to pay
customary letter of credit fees, including, without limitation, a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable

ratios) of excess cash flow less certain deductions; and

(c) 100% of net cash proceeds from certain asset sales and other recovery events in excess of
$20 million per annum by us or our restricted subsidiaries not reinvested in useful assets
within one year (or, if later, 6 months after the entry into a binding commitment to reinvest
the net cash proceeds within such one-year period).

**_Security and Guarantees_**

Our obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be guaranteed by Solera
Parent Holding, LLC, the direct parent company of the Issuer (“Parent Holding”), and certain of its
direct and indirect wholly-owned material subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. All obligations
under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the related guarantees will be secured by a
perfected first priority lien or security interest in substantially all of our and the guarantors’ tangible and
intangible assets, subject to certain exceptions.

**_Covenants_**

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will contain customary affirmative and negative

other restricted payments; limitations on investments, loans, advances and acquisitions; limitations on

commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility on the last day of any quarter.

**_Events of Default_**

Events of default under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities include, among others,

respect to us, Parent Holding or any of our material restricted subsidiaries; material unsatisfied or
unstayed judgments; certain ERISA events; a change of control; or actual or asserted invalidity of any
material guarantee or security document.

**Terms Subject to Change**

The terms described above with respect to the New Term Loan Facility and the New Revolving
Facility are subject to change and a number of conditions, including the consummation of the
Transactions and this offering. To the extent that any of the conditions with respect to such
indebtedness are not satisfied, such indebtedness may not be available on the terms described herein
or at all.

161


-----

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

**General**

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading “Certain Definitions.” In
this description, (i) the term “Issuers” refers to Solera, LLC (the “Company”) and Solera Finance, Inc.
(the “Co-Issuer”) and not to any of their respective Subsidiaries and (ii) the terms “we,” “our” and “us”
each refer to (a) prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, Solera Holdings, Inc. (“Solera”) and its
consolidated Subsidiaries and (b) from and after the consummation of the Acquisition, the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries, including Solera. The Co-Issuer will not have any assets or
revenues. Accordingly, you should not expect the Co-Issuer to participate in servicing the principal and
interest obligations on the Notes.

The Issuers will issue $1,730,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 10.500% Senior Notes due
2024 (the “Notes”) under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Initial Indenture”) among
the Issuers, Summertime Acquisition Corp. (“Merger Sub”), the other guarantors party thereto and U.S.
Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Notes will be issued concurrently with the
merger of Merger Sub with and into Solera, with Solera as the surviving corporation (the “Acquisition”)
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Upon consummation of the Acquisition, Solera (as survivor of the
merger with Merger Sub) will enter into a supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture”) with
the other Guarantors and the Trustee pursuant to which Solera will assume all of the rights and
obligations of Merger Sub under the Initial Indenture and Solera and the other Guarantors will
guarantee the obligations of the Issuers effective as of and from the effective time of the Acquisition.
For purposes of this description, the term “Indenture” shall mean the Initial Indenture, as supplemented
by the Supplemental Indenture. The Indenture will not be subject to, or contain provisions
corresponding or similar to certain of, the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of
the Securities Act. Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to any registration rights. See “Transfer
Restrictions.”

The following description is only a summary of certain provisions of the Indenture, the Notes and
the Guarantees, does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to, the provisions of the Indenture and the Notes, including the definitions of certain terms
used therein. We urge you to read each of these documents because they, and not this description, will
define your rights as Holders. You may request copies of the Indenture and the Notes at our address
set forth under the heading “Summary.”

**Brief Description of Notes**

The Notes will:

‰ be unsecured senior debt obligations of the Issuers;

‰ contemporaneously with the consummation of the Acquisition, be guaranteed on a senior
unsecured basis by each Guarantor;

‰ rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of the
Issuers and the Guarantors;

‰ rank equal in right of payment to all existing and future unsecured senior Indebtedness of the
Issuers and the Guarantors, including the obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under
any remaining Existing Notes outstanding following consummation of the Tender Offer;

‰ be effectively subordinated to all existing and future Secured Indebtedness and other
obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors, including the obligations of the Issuers and the
Guarantors under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, to the extent of the value of the
collateral securing such Secured Indebtedness and other obligations; and

162


-----

‰ be structurally subordinated to all Indebtedness and other claims and liabilities of the
Company’s non-Guarantor Subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuer).

**Guarantees**

The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, will jointly and severally, fully
and unconditionally Guarantee, on an unsecured senior basis, the performance and full and punctual
payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Issuers
under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest in
respect of the Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise including all fees and expenses due and
owing to the Trustee, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture.

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior
unsecured basis by each Domestic Subsidiary (other than the Co-Issuer and any Excluded
Subsidiaries) that is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Company that incurs or guarantees any
Obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or certain future Indebtedness of the Issuers or
any Guarantor (and any Foreign Subsidiary or Domestic Subsidiary that is a non-Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary (in each case, other than any Excluded Subsidiary) if such Foreign Subsidiary or nonWholly-Owned Subsidiary guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, certain syndicated bank
indebtedness or certain capital markets debt securities of the Issuers or any Guarantor). Each of the
Guarantees of the Notes will be a general unsecured obligation of each Guarantor and will rank equally
in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness and other obligations of each
such entity that are not, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, will be
effectively subordinated to all existing and future Secured Indebtedness and other obligations of each
such entity (including obligations of such entity under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) to the extent
of the value of the collateral securing such Indebtedness and other obligations, and will be senior in
right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of each such entity.

The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the Indebtedness and other obligations of Subsidiaries
of the Company (other than the Co-Issuer) that do not Guarantee the Notes. Not all of the Company’s
Subsidiaries in existence on the date of the Acquisition will Guarantee the Notes, and Restricted
Subsidiaries will be required to Guarantee the Notes only to the extent provided for under “Certain
Covenants—Guarantors.” In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these
non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their
trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuers. For the twelve months
ended December 31, 2015, the Subsidiaries of the Company that are not expected to guarantee the Notes
generated 51.9% of the Company’s consolidated revenues and 63.9% of the Company’s consolidated
Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, at December 31, 2015, excluding the effect of intercompany balances as
well as intercompany transactions, these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries held approximately 33.2% of the
Company’s total consolidated assets and had approximately $251.5 million of the Company’s consolidated
total liabilities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related our Indebtedness and the Notes—The notes and the
note guarantees are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.”

We expect that all of the Company’s Subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuer) existing as of the
Issue Date will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” However, under certain circumstances, we will be
permitted to designate certain of our future subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not
guarantee the Notes.

Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of
all guaranteed Obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an
amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net
assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

163


-----

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent
such Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law and, therefore, are
limited to the amount that such Guarantor could guarantee without such Guarantee constituting a
fraudulent conveyance; this limitation, however, may not be effective to prevent such Guarantee from
constituting a fraudulent conveyance. If a Guarantee is rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by
a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of such
Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its
Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the
Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and/or the note
guarantees and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.”

A Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that its Obligations under the Indenture and
its Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(1) (a) any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (by merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor, after
which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) all or substantially all
of the assets of such Guarantor; provided that such sale, exchange, transfer or disposition of
Capital Stock or assets is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture
(including any amendments thereof);

(b) the release or discharge of (or, substantially concurrently with the release of the
Guarantee of such Guarantor, the Guarantor will be released and discharged from) the
guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor with respect to the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities or the release or discharge of (or, substantially concurrently with the release
of the Guarantee of such Guarantor, the Guarantor will be released and discharged from)
such other guarantee or direct obligation that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee,
except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct
obligation (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent release is still a
release);

(c) the proper designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, an Excluded Subsidiary or an Immaterial Subsidiary in compliance
with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(d) the Issuers exercising their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option
as described under “Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the Issuers’
obligations under the Indenture being satisfied and discharged in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture;

(e) (i) the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the
Company, the Co-Issuer or another Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger,
amalgamation or consolidation, or (ii) the liquidation or dissolution of such Guarantor
following the transfer of all or substantially all of its assets to the Company, the Co-Issuer or
another Guarantor;

(f) subject to customary contingent reinstatement obligations, upon payment in full of
the aggregate principal amount of all Notes then outstanding and other Obligations then due
and owing; or

(g) as described under “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”; and

(2) the Company delivering to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such
transaction have been complied with. Upon request, the Trustee shall execute an instrument
evidencing the release of such Guarantor.

164


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Intermediate Holdings CFC One, Intermediate Holdings
CFC Two, Intermediate Holdings CFC Three and Intermediate Holdings CFC Four will be released
from its Obligations under the Indenture and its Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged upon consummation of the Post-Closing Restructuring Transactions.

**Ranking**

The payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and the payment of
any Guarantee will rank equal in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness and other
obligations of the Issuers or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, that are not, by their terms,
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Guarantee of such Guarantor.

The Notes will be effectively subordinated to all of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ existing and
future Secured Indebtedness and other secured obligations (including the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’
obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) to the extent of the value of the collateral
securing such Indebtedness and other secured obligations and will be structurally subordinated to all
Indebtedness and other claims and liabilities of the Company’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries (other than
the Co-Issuer). As of December 31, 2015, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions,

(1) the Issuers and the Guarantors would have had in the aggregate $2,200.0 million of Secured
Indebtedness and $300.0 million of unused availability under the revolving portion of the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities; and

(2) the Company’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries would not have had any Indebtedness (excluding
intercompany liabilities).

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Secured Indebtedness
that the Issuers and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, under certain circumstances the amount of
such Secured Indebtedness could be substantial. See “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “Certain Covenants—
Liens.” In addition, although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness by and the issuance
of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of the Issuers’ Restricted Subsidiaries, such limitation is
subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications and the Indebtedness incurred and
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock issued in compliance with the covenants could be substantial.
See “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock.” Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence or
issuance by such Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuers will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial paying agent for the
Notes will be the Trustee. The applicable paying agent will make payments on the Notes on behalf of
the Issuers.

The Issuers will also maintain a registrar with respect to the Notes. The initial registrar for the
Notes will be the Trustee. The applicable registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the
applicable Notes outstanding from time to time and facilitate transfers of Notes on behalf of the Issuers.

The Issuers may change the paying agents, registrars or transfer agent without prior notice to the
Holders. The Issuers or any of their respective Subsidiaries may act as paying agent, registrar or
transfer agent.

165


-----

If any Notes are listed on an exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuers will
satisfy any requirement of such exchange as to paying agents, transfer agents and registrars and will
comply with any notice requirements required under such exchange in connection with any change of
paying agent, transfer agent or registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture and the restrictions
set forth in the section of this Offering Circular entitled “Transfer Restrictions.” The registrar and the
Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in
connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all Taxes and fees required by law
and due on transfer. The Issuers will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for
redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer, an Asset Sale Offer or other tender offer. Also, the Issuers will not be required to transfer or
exchange any Note for a period of 10 days before delivering a notice of redemption of Notes to be
redeemed. The registered Holder will be treated as the owner of the Notes for all purposes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuers will issue $1,730,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes in this offering. The
Notes will mature on March 1, 2024. Subject to compliance with the covenant described under “Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock,” the Issuers may issue additional Notes (“Additional Notes”) from time to time after
this offering under the Indenture. The Notes offered hereby and any Additional Notes subsequently
issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class (except as otherwise provided) for all
purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase;
_provided; however, that a separate CUSIP or ISIN will be issued for the Additional Notes, unless the_
Notes and the Additional Notes are treated as fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The
Indenture will permit the Issuers to designate the maturity date, interest rate and optional redemption
provisions applicable to each series of Additional Notes, which may differ from the maturity date,
interest rate and optional redemption provisions applicable to the initial Notes issued on the Issue
Date. Additional Notes that differ with respect to maturity date, interest rate or optional redemption
provisions from the initial Notes issued on the Issue Date will constitute a different series of Notes from
such initial Notes. Additional Notes that have the same maturity date, interest rate and optional
redemption provisions as the initial Notes issued on the Issue Date will be treated as the same series
as such initial Notes unless otherwise designated by the Issuers. The Issuers similarly will be entitled
to vary the application of certain other provisions to any series of Additional Notes. Subject to the
foregoing, unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Notes” for all purposes of the Indenture
and this “Description of Notes” include any Additional Notes that are actually issued. The Notes will be
issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 10.500% per annum and will be payable in cash
semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1, commencing on September 1, 2016, to the
Holders of record on the immediately preceding February 15 and August 15. Interest on the Notes will
accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from
and including the Issue Date. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of
the paying agent maintained for such purpose, as described under “Paying Agent and Registrar for the
Notes,” or, at the option of the Issuers, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the
Holders at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided that all cash

166


-----

payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by one or
more global Notes registered in the name of or held by The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its
nominee will be made in accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures. Until otherwise designated by
the Issuers, the Issuers’ office or agency will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose.
If any interest payment date, the maturity date or any earlier repurchase or redemption date falls on a
day that is a Legal Holiday, the required payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day
and no interest on such payment will accrue in respect of the delay.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuers will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments
with respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuers may be required to offer
to purchase Notes as described under the caption “Repurchase at the Option of Holders.” The Issuers,
the Investors and their respective Affiliates may, at their discretion, at any time and from time to time,
acquire Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases,
negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as such
acquisition does not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture, upon such terms and at such prices
as the Issuers, the Investors or their respective Affiliates may determine, which may be more or less
than the consideration for which the Notes offered hereby are being sold and could be for cash or other
consideration.

**Redemption of Notes for Tax Reasons**

The Issuers may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than
30 days’ prior notice to the Holders of such Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to but not including the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the rights of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under “—Payment of Additional Amounts on the
Notes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the
redemption or otherwise, if the Issuers determine in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below); or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official written application, administration or
interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or
order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice or revenue
guidance) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of such Notes would be,
required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such Notes, and such obligation cannot be avoided
by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
appointment of a new paying agent where this would be reasonable, but not including assignment of
the obligation to make payment with respect to such Notes). Such Change in Tax Law must (i) not
have been publicly announced before the Issue Date and (ii) become effective on or after the Issue
Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date
after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after
such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on such Notes and (b) mutatis
_mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture,_
with respect to a change or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a
party to the Indenture.

167


-----

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures
described under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption
will be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make
such payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of
any Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuers will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate
stating that they are entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that
the conditions precedent to their right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an
independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a
result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s
Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described
above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Payment of Additional Amounts on the Notes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuers or any Guarantor (including, in each case, any
successor entity) (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Guarantee thereof, as
applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account
of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If, after the
occurrence of a European Domicile Transaction (as defined in “—Merger, Consolidation,
Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”), any deduction or withholding for, or on
account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any Note or Guarantee thereof is made,
or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to
tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes,
or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and
(2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or
the paying agent with respect to any Note or Guarantee thereof, including payments of principal,
redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such
withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would
have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Guarantee thereof in the
absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be
payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or
former connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner of the Note (or between
a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power
over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an
estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or
being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a
permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction)
but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or
holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights
under such Note, the Indenture or a Guarantee of such Note;

168


-----

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial
owner of the Note to provide an applicable Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (with any
required attachments) or W-9 or to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the
Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 60 days before any such withholding or deduction would
be made), to provide other certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning
the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any
declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters,
which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but, only to the extent the
Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the
Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant
payment is first made available for payment to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on
or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee thereof;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a
Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the
Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another paying agent in a member state of
the European Union;

(7) any Taxes imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended
or successor version that is substantively comparable), any current or future regulations or
agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant
to Section 1471(b) of the Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively
comparable), or any law, legislation, rules or practices implementing an intergovernmental
agreement relating thereto;

(8) any Taxes imposed as a result of the Holder or beneficial owner being or having been (i) a
“10-percent shareholder” of an Issuer as defined in Section 871(h)(3) of the Code or any
successor provision or (ii) a controlled foreign corporation that is related to an Issuer within
the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code or any successor provision;

(9) any Taxes imposed as a result of the Holder or beneficial owner being a bank receiving
payments on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the
ordinary course of its trade or business, as described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code or
any successor provision;

(10) any Taxes imposed by reason of the Holder’s or beneficial owner’s past or present status as
a passive foreign investment company, a controlled foreign corporation, a foreign taxexempt organization or a personal holding company with respect to the United States or as
a corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; or

(11) any combination of the items (1) through (10) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or limited liability company or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to
the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership
or limited liability company or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts
had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The applicable withholding agent will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit
the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction

169


-----

in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of
tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the
Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not available, other
reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies
or other evidence shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made
available at the offices of the paying agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made
on any Note or Guarantee of a Note, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will
deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable
and the amount estimated to be so payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises
less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such
Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date).
The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely, without further inquiry, on such Officer’s Certificate as
conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any
context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any Guarantee of a Note,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

After the occurrence of a European Domicile Transaction, the Payor will pay and indemnify the
Holders and beneficial owners of the Notes for any present or future stamp, transfer, issue,
registration, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar
charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, or receipt of
payments with respect to, any Note or any Guarantee of a Note, the Indenture, or any other document
or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Notes
after this offering and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise
from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar
charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (10)).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture
and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized,
engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or
through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes or Guarantees thereof is made by or on
behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth above under the caption “Redemption of Notes for Tax Reasons,” below in
this section or in the circumstances set forth in the thirteenth paragraph under “Repurchase at the
Option of Holders—Change of Control,” the Issuers will not be entitled to redeem the Notes at their
option prior to March 1, 2019.

170


-----

At any time prior to March 1, 2019, the Issuers may on one or more occasions redeem all or a
part of the Notes, upon notice as described under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable
Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption (any
applicable date of redemption hereunder, the “Redemption Date”), subject to the rights of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

On and after March 1, 2019, the Issuers may on one or more occasions redeem the Notes, in
whole or in part, upon notice as described under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” at the
redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set
forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable
Redemption Date, subject to the rights of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period
beginning on March 1 of each of the years indicated below:

In addition, at any time prior to March 1, 2019, the Issuers may, at their option, on one or more
occasions, upon notice as described under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” redeem up to 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Indenture (including any Additional Notes) at
a redemption price (as calculated by the Issuers) equal to (a) 110.500% of the aggregate principal
amount thereof with an amount equal to or less than the net cash proceeds from one or more Equity
Offerings to the extent such net cash proceeds are received by or contributed to the Company plus
(b) accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date,
subject to the rights of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date; provided that (a) at least 50% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the Notes being redeemed remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each
such redemption (unless all Notes outstanding on the Redemption Date are redeemed) and (b) that
each such redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of closing of each such Equity Offering.

If the Redemption Date is on or after an interest record date but on or prior to the related interest
payment date, then any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date in respect
of Notes subject to redemption will be paid on the Redemption Date to the Person in whose name the
Note is registered at the close of business, on such record date, and no additional interest will be
payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuers.

Notice of any redemption of Notes (including upon an Equity Offering or in connection with
another transaction (or series of related transactions) or an event that constitutes a Change of Control)
may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be given prior to the completion or the occurrence thereof and any such
redemption or notice may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent,
including, but not limited to, completion or occurrence of the related Equity Offering or other transaction
or event, as the case may be. In addition, if such redemption or purchase is subject to satisfaction of
one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable,
shall state that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the Redemption Date may be delayed until such time
(including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or delivered, including
by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in
their sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be
rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the

171


-----

Issuers in their sole discretion) by the Redemption Date, or by the Redemption Date as so delayed, or
such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Issuers’ discretion if in the good faith judgment of the
Issuers any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied. In addition, the Issuers may provide in such
notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuers’ obligations with respect to
such redemption may be performed by another Person. In no event shall the Trustee be responsible
for monitoring, or charged with knowledge of, the maximum aggregate amount of any series of Notes
eligible under the Indenture to be redeemed.

**_Selection and Notice_**

If the Issuers are redeeming less than all of the Notes issued by it at any time, the Trustee will
select the Notes to be redeemed (a) on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable (or, in the case of
Notes in global form, the Trustee will select Notes for redemption based on the method of DTC that
most nearly approximates a pro rata selection or by such other method that the Trustee shall deem fair
and appropriate) or (b) by lot or such other similar method in accordance with the procedures of DTC;
_provided that no Notes of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed or repurchased in part._

Notices of purchase or redemption shall be sent electronically (in PDF or similar format) or mailed
by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 10, but except as set forth in the sixth paragraph under “—
Optional Redemption,” not more than 60 days before the purchase or Redemption Date to each Holder
at such Holder’s registered address and upon at least 30 days prior written notice to the Trustee
(unless a shorter time shall be agreed to by the Trustee), except that redemption notices may be sent
more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of
the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Note is to be purchased or redeemed
in part only, any notice of purchase or redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of
the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased or redeemed.

For Notes that are represented by global certificates held on behalf of DTC, notices may be given
by delivery of the relevant notices to DTC for communication to entitled account holders in substitution
of the aforementioned delivery.

Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption, unless such
redemption or purchase is conditioned on the happening of a future event. On and after the
Redemption Date, unless the Issuers default in payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to
accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption, unless such redemption remains
conditioned on the happening of a future event. Redemption amounts shall only be paid upon
presentation and surrender of any such Notes to be redeemed. Payment of the redemption price and
performance of the Issuers’ obligations in connection with any redemption may be performed by
another Person.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Issue Date, unless, prior to,
or concurrently with, the time the Issuers are required to make a Change of Control Offer (as defined
below) the Issuers have previously or concurrently mailed or transmitted electronically (in PDF or
similar format) a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under
“Optional Redemption” or “Satisfaction and Discharge,” the Issuers will make an offer to purchase all of
the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the
“Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Change of Control Payment Date, subject to the rights
of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest

172


-----

payment date. Except as set forth above, within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers
will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by first class mail or electronically (in PDF or similar
format), with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder to the address of such Holder appearing in the
security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC with the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled
“Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,” and that all Notes properly tendered
pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuers;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”),
which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent,
except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of
Control as described below;

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue
interest;

(4) that, unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all
Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest
on the Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control
Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect
Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the
procedures of DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the
notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day (or such other Business Day as
may be specified in the notice) preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require
the Issuers to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the
expiration time of the Change of Control Offer, an electronic transmission (in PDF or similar
format), facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder or otherwise in
accordance with the procedures of DTC, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase and
a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such
Notes purchased;

(7) that if the Issuers are purchasing less than all of the Notes, the Holders of the remaining
Notes will be issued new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the
unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the Notes must be
equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof;

(8) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the
Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and
describing each such condition, and, if applicable, stating that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the
Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days
after the notice is mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion), or that such
purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that the Issuers shall
determine that the Change of Control will not occur by the Change of Control Payment Date, or
by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and

(9) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuers, consistent with the covenant
described hereunder, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control or conditioned upon such Change of Control, with a purchase date to
occur upon, or within a specified period of time after, the consummation of such Change of Control.

173


-----

If the Change of Control Payment Date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the
related interest payment date, then any accrued and unpaid interest to the Change of Control Payment
Date will be paid on the Change of Control Payment Date to the Person in whose name a Note is
registered at the close of business on such record date.

While the Notes are in global form and if the Issuers make an offer to purchase all of the Notes
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of
the Notes through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations.

The Issuers will comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are
applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the
extent that the applicable provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of
the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not
be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer,

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control
Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered, and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted
together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof
have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuers.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to
Indebtedness to which the Company or the Co-Issuer become a party may prohibit or limit the Issuers
from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs
at a time when the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuers could seek the
consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings
that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the
Issuers will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase
tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture after any required giving of
notice and lapse of time as described under, “Events of Default and Remedies.”

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will, and future credit agreements or other debt agreements
to which the Company or the Co-Issuer becomes a party may, provide that certain change of control
events with respect to the Company would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of
Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under our
Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such other Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such default or
seek to refinance our Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other Indebtedness. In the event we do
not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and such other
Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and such other Indebtedness being declared due and payable.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Indebtedness and the Notes—We may not be able to purchase the notes upon a change of control,
which would result in a default under the indenture that will govern the notes and would materially
adversely affect our business and financial condition.”

174


-----

In the event that the Issuers make a Change of Control Payment, the paying agent will promptly
mail or wire transfer to each Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee
will promptly authenticate a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the
Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or
an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

The Change of Control Offer feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more
difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Company (or any Parent Entity) and, thus, the removal of
incumbent management. The Change of Control Offer feature is a result of negotiations between the
Initial Purchasers of the Notes and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving
a Change of Control following the Issue Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the
future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of
Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such
time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional
Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “Certain
Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in
such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford
Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with
the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuers, or any third party
making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuers as described above, purchases all of the Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuers or such third party will have the right,
upon not less than 15 days nor more than 60 days’ prior notice as described under the heading
“Optional Redemption—Selection and Notice” (provided that such notice is given not more than 30
days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above), to redeem all
Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to 101% of
the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that
remain outstanding to, but excluding, the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the
Redemption Date).

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than a Permitted Holder.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances
there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition
of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a
Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuers to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of
Control,” may be waived, amended or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration
at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined at the time of
contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or
otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration for such
Asset Sale received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the
form of (a) cash or Cash Equivalents, (b) Replacement Assets or (c) any combination of the
consideration specified in clauses (a) through (e); provided that the amount of:

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most
recent balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto or if incurred, accrued or increased
subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected
on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence,
accrual or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as
determined in good faith by the Company) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary,
other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are assumed by
the transferee (or a third party on behalf of the transferee) of any such assets or are
otherwise extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be
satisfied for cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents
received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale;

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken
together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received since the date of this
Indenture pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the
greater of (x) $125.0 million and (y) 22.0% of EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement
Period at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (with the fair
market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the
time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value);

(d) any securities publicly-traded on a national securities exchange; and

(e) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Guarantor received
from Persons who are not an Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

shall be deemed to be cash or Cash Equivalents for purposes of this provision and for no other
purpose.

Within 450 days after the Company’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net Proceeds
of any Asset Sale (the “Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period”), the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale,

(1) to repurchase, prepay or redeem:

(a) any Indebtedness secured by a Permitted Lien (and, if such Indebtedness is
revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect
thereto);

176


-----

(b) Obligations under the Notes or any Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that if the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall so repay any Pari Passu Indebtedness other than
the Notes, the Company will either (A) reduce Obligations under the Notes on a pro rata basis
by, at its option, (i) redeeming Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or any
equivalent provision with respect to any Additional Notes or (ii) purchasing Notes through openmarket purchases, or (B) make an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for
an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes on a ratable basis with such other
Pari Passu Indebtedness, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), for no less than 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, thereon; or

(c) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor
(and, if such Indebtedness is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce
commitments with respect thereto), other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or
another Restricted Subsidiary; or

(2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses operating or engaged in a
Similar Business (provided that if such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition
of Capital Stock, such acquisition results in the Company or another of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it
constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary); (b) capital expenditures; or
(c) acquisitions of other properties or assets, in each of the foregoing subclauses (b) and (c),
used or useful in a Similar Business or that replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that
are the subject of such Asset Sale; or

(3) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided, that a binding commitment entered into not later than such 450th day shall be treated as a_
permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such
Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of the Asset Sale Proceeds
Application Period (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such
manner within the later of 450 days from the consummation of the Asset Sale and 180 days from the
date of the Acceptable Commitment, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then such Net
Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary enters
into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation
or termination and such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such manner within 180 days from the
date of the Second Commitment; provided, further, that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall
constitute Excess Proceeds to the extent the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period has expired.

Any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided within the time
period set forth in the preceding paragraph (it being understood that any portion of such Net Proceeds
used to make an offer to purchase Notes, as described in clause (1) above, shall be deemed to have
been invested whether or not such offer is accepted) will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.”
When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $50.0 million, the Issuers shall make an
offer to all Holders and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to the holders of such
Pari Passu Indebtedness (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase (or redeem or repay, as applicable) the
maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari
Passu Indebtedness that is, with respect to the Notes only, in an amount equal to at least $2,000, or an
integral multiple of $1,000 thereafter, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer
price, with respect to the Notes only, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof (or accreted value thereof, as applicable), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the

177


-----

Indenture and, if applicable, the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuers will
commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 10 Business Days after the
date that Excess Proceeds exceed $50.0 million (the “Asset Sale Purchase Date”) by mailing or
electronically sending (in PDF or similar format) the notice required pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to
any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net
Proceeds prior to the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (the “Advance Offer”)
with respect to all or a part of the available Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being
required to do so by the Indenture.

If the Asset Sale Purchase Date is on or after an applicable interest record date and on or before
the related interest payment date, then any accrued and unpaid interest to the Asset Sale Purchase
Date will be paid on the Asset Sale Purchase Date to the Person in whose name a Note is registered
at the close of business on such record date.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and,
if applicable, such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the
Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers may use any
remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in any manner
not prohibited by the Indenture, and they will no longer constitute Excess Proceeds. If the aggregate
principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness
surrendered in an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an
Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Trustee shall select the Notes and the Issuers shall select
such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased or repaid on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes
in global form, the Trustee will select Notes for redemption based on the method of DTC that most
nearly approximates a pro rata selection or by such other method that the Trustee shall deem fair and
appropriate) based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such Pari Passu
Indebtedness tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness,
as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. For the purposes of
calculating the principal amount of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness not denominated in U.S. dollars,
such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into the U.S. dollar
equivalent determined as of the Business Day immediately prior to the date on which the Asset Sale
Offer is announced. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds
shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such
completion), and in the case of an Advance Offer, the amount of Net Proceeds the Issuers are offering
to apply in such Advance Offer shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds.
Additionally, upon consummation or expiration of any Advance Offer, any remaining Net Proceeds
shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuers may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose
not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net
Proceeds of any Asset Sale by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is prohibited or delayed by
applicable local law from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Proceeds so
affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be
retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law will not
permit repatriation to the United States (the Company hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Foreign
Subsidiary to promptly take all commercially reasonable actions available under the applicable local law to
permit such repatriation), and once such repatriation of any such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under
the applicable local law, such amount (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result
thereof) at such time shall be considered the Net Proceeds in respect of an Asset Sale and (ii) to the
extent that the Company has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Proceeds of
any Foreign Disposition would have a material adverse Tax consequence (which for the avoidance of

178


-----

doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any repatriation whereby doing so the Company, any Restricted
Subsidiary, or any of their respective affiliates and/or equity owners would incur a material tax liability,
including as a result of a dividend or deemed dividend, or a material withholding tax, but taking into
account any foreign tax credit or benefit received in connection with such repatriation) with respect to such
Net Proceeds, the Net Proceeds so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary.

Pending the final application of an amount equal to the Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant,
the Company or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to
reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility (including the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities) or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

The Issuers will comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are
applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the
extent that the applicable provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under the Asset Sale provisions described in
the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements
relating to Indebtedness to which the Company (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may prohibit
or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this Asset Sales covenant. In the event the
Issuers are contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company or one of its Affiliates, as
the case may be, could seek the consent of its respective lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could
attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company or one of its Affiliates,
as the case may be, does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuers will remain
contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase
tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture after any required giving of
notice and lapse of time as described under “Events of Default and Remedies.”

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an Asset Sale Offer,
including the definition of “Asset Sale,” may be waived, amended or modified at any time with the
written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of the
applicable series then outstanding.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Effectiveness of Covenants_**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants to be contained in the Indenture that will
apply from and after the Issue Date. If on any date following the Issue Date (i) the Notes have an
Investment Grade Rating from both Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing
under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being
collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”), then beginning on such date and
continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries
will not be subject to the following covenants (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales;”

(2) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(3) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock;”

(4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or
Substantially All Assets;”

179


-----

(5) “—Certain Covenants—Transactions with Affiliates;”

(6) “—Certain Covenants—Guarantees;” and

(7) “—Certain Covenants—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries.”

Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event (the date of such occurrence, the
“Suspension Date”), the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Sale shall be reset at zero. In the
event that the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants
for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”)
one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating
assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to future events.

The period of time between (and including) the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date (but
excluding the Reversion Date) is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.”

In the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default
under the Indenture with respect to the Notes; provided that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments
made on or after the Reversion Date, the amount of Restricted Payments made will be calculated as
though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in
effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period, (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or

Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during the
Suspension Period.

Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant and such Restricted
Payment or Investment shall be treated as having been made pursuant to only the clause or clauses of
this covenant or of the definition of “Permitted Investment” to which such Restricted Payment or
Investment has been classified or reclassified.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the fair market value on the date
of the Restricted Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred_**
**_Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or
otherwise (collectively, “incur” and collectively, an “incurrence”) with respect to any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Company will not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock and
will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock;
_provided, however, that the Company may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or_
issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness), issue shares of Disqualified Stock and issue shares of Preferred Stock, if the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio on a consolidated basis for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries’
most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately
preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is issued would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00, determined on a pro forma basis
(including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had
been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the
application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period; provided
that the amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock that may be incurred or issued,
as applicable, pursuant to the foregoing by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors (other than
the Co-Issuer) shall not exceed at any time outstanding the greater of (x) $125.0 million and (y) 22.0% of
EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period (the “Non-Guarantor Debt Cap”).

amount thereof) under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other Debt Facility in an
aggregate principal amount not to exceed the sum of (x) $2,800.0 million at any one time
outstanding and (y) an additional aggregate principal amount after all amounts have been
incurred under clause (x), so long as immediately after giving effect to any such incurrence and
the application of net proceeds therefrom the Total Net Secured Leverage Ratio does not exceed
3.25 to 1.00; provided, however, that such amount shall be decreased by: (A) the aggregate
amount of all mandatory amortization payments and commitment reductions with respect to
Indebtedness, in each case under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other Debt Facility
that have been made by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than
repayments that are concurrently refunded or refinanced) since the Issue Date and (B) the
aggregate amount of all Net Proceeds of Asset Sales applied by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date to repay any Indebtedness under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities or any other Debt Facility (and if such Indebtedness is revolving credit
Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto) pursuant to the
covenant described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset
Sales”; provided that (i) any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (1) shall be deemed to
be Secured Indebtedness, whether or not so secured, solely for purposes of calculating the Total

Notes (including any Guarantee thereof but excluding any Additional Notes, if any, or guarantee
with respect thereto);

Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any
Person owning such assets, in an aggregate principal amount (including any refinancing thereof),

in the ordinary course of business, including letters of credit in respect of workers’ compensation
claims, unemployment insurance and other types of social security, or property, casualty or

obligations; provided, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit, such obligations are
reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing;

(6) Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries
providing for indemnification, adjustment of purchase price, earn-out or similar obligations, in
each case, incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business,

excluding any Indebtedness in respect of accounts payable incurred in connection with goods
and services rendered in the ordinary course of business (and not in connection with the
borrowing of money), is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; provided further
that any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event which results in
any such other Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any other
subsequent transfer of any such Indebtedness (except to the Company or another Restricted
Subsidiary or any pledge of such Indebtedness constituting a Permitted Lien) shall be deemed, in
each case, to be an incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (7);

(8) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted
Subsidiary; provided that if a Guarantor incurs such Indebtedness to a Restricted Subsidiary that
is not a Guarantor, excluding any Indebtedness in respect of accounts payable incurred in
connection with goods and services rendered in the ordinary course of business (and not in
connection with the borrowing of money), such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of

into for speculative purposes);

(11) Indebtedness in respect of performance bonds, bid bonds, appeal bonds, surety bonds,

correlative meaning) any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred as
permitted under the first paragraph of this covenant and clauses (2), (3), (4), (12), this clause
(13), clauses (14), (18), (19) and (22) below or any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant:

(1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any
portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in clauses (2) through (31) of the preceding
paragraph or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the
Company, in its sole discretion, as applicable, may divide, classify or reclassify, or later divide,
classify or reclassify, such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any
portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant and will only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or
portion thereof) in one or more of the above clauses or paragraphs; provided that all
Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on the Issue Date will be

194


-----

deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on clause (x) of clause (1) of the
preceding paragraph and shall not be reclassified; and

(2) with respect to clauses (4), (12), (18), (19) and (22) of the second paragraph of this
covenant, if at any time that the Company would be entitled to have incurred any then
outstanding item of Indebtedness under the first paragraph of this covenant, such item of
Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness incurred pursuant to
the first paragraph of this covenant.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, the accretion of liquidation preference and increases
in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of
currencies will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
for purposes of this covenant. Any Refinancing Indebtedness and any Indebtedness permitted to be
incurred under the Indenture to refinance Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this covenant shall be
deemed to include additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay accrued
and unpaid interest and dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, fees and
expenses in connection with such refinancing and may be in the form of accretion of accreted value, the
accretion or amortization of original issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of
additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock. Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of
letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness that are otherwise included in the determination of a particular
amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination of such amount of Indebtedness;
_provided that the incurrence of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the_
case may be, was in compliance with this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the
incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated
in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of
revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness
denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollardenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have
been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus the amount of any reasonable premium
(including tender premiums), defeasance costs and any reasonable fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the issuance of such new Indebtedness.

The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in
a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that
is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) that secures Obligations
under any Indebtedness or any related guarantee, on any asset or property of the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary, or any income or profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive
income therefrom, unless:

(1) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Indebtedness, the Notes and related
Guarantees are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority
to such Liens; or

195


-----

(2) in all other cases, the Notes or the Guarantees are equally and ratably secured.

The foregoing shall not apply to (a) Liens securing the Notes and the related Guarantees,
(b) Liens securing Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under Debt Facilities, including any letter of
credit facility relating thereto, that was permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred pursuant
to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption “—Limitation
on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” and (c) Liens
incurred to secure Obligations in respect of any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the
covenant described above under the caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance
of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; provided that, in the case of this clause (c), at the time of
the incurrence of such Indebtedness and after giving pro forma effect thereto, including the use of
proceeds therefrom, the Total Net Secured Leverage Ratio would not exceed 3.25 to 1.00.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lien securing the Notes granted pursuant to this covenant
shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of
the Lien that gave rise to the obligation to secure the Notes.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (x) a Lien need not be incurred solely
by reference to clauses (a) through (c) of the second preceding paragraph or one or more clauses in
the definition of “Permitted Liens” but may be incurred under any combination of such categories
(including in part under one such category and in part under any other such category) and (y) in the
event that any Lien restricted by this covenant meets the criteria of clause (b) or (c) of the second
preceding paragraph or one or more clauses in the definition of Permitted Liens, the Issuers, in their
sole discretion, may divide, classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify such Lien (or any
portion thereof) among one or more such clauses or one or more clauses in the definition of Permitted
Liens pursuant to which such Lien would have been permitted at the time so divided, classified or
reclassified, as the case may be.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness
at the time of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any
Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any
increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of
accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of
additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation
preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations
in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Transactions._** When calculating the availability
under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in connection with a Limited Condition
Transaction and any related transactions (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of
proceeds thereof), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and/or absence of any Default or
Event of Default shall, at the option of the Company, be the date the definitive agreements for such
Limited Condition Transaction are entered into, and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated with such
_pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set_
forth in the definition of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio after giving effect to such Limited Condition
Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any
incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the
most recent Applicable Measurement Period ending prior to such date and, for the avoidance of doubt,
(x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio
(including due to fluctuations in EBITDA of the Company or the target company) subsequent to such date
of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Transaction, such
baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for
purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Transaction is permitted under the Indenture and

196


-----

(y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition
Transaction or related transactions; provided, that if the Company elects to have such determinations
occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any incurrence
of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the
definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or
ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such
Limited Condition Transaction unless and until such Limited Condition Transaction has been abandoned,
as determined by the Company, prior to the consummation thereof; provided, further, that in connection
with the making of Restricted Payments prior to the consummation of such Limited Condition
Transaction, the calculation of Consolidated Net Income and EBITDA (and any defined term a
component of which is Consolidated Net Income or EBITDA) shall not, in any case, assume such Limited
Condition Transaction has been consummated.

**_Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets_**

The Company will not consolidate, merge or amalgamate with or into or wind up into (whether or
not it is the surviving entity), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) the Company is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation, merger or amalgamation (if other than the Company) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a European
Company (Societas Europaea) or a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability
company, trust or other similar entity organized or existing under the laws of the United States,
any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof, or any member state of the
European Union (such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor
_Company” and any such transaction resulting in a European Company or entity organized or_
existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union becoming a Successor
Company, a “European Domicile Transaction”) and, if such Successor Company is not a
corporation, the Co-Issuer remains (or in lieu of the Co-Issuer another corporation becomes) a
co-obligor of the Notes;

(2) the Successor Company, if other than the Company expressly assumes all the
obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes pursuant to supplemental
indentures or other documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such
transaction as having been incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at
the time of such transaction), no Default exists;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction and any related financing
transactions, as if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of the Applicable
Measurement Period, either (x) the Successor Company or the Company would be permitted to
incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test
set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or (y) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Company (or the Successor Company, as applicable) would not be lower
than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company immediately prior to such transaction;

(5) each Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, in which
case clause (1)(b) of the fourth succeeding paragraph shall apply, shall have by supplemental
indenture confirmed that its Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s obligations under the
Indenture and the Notes; and

(6) the Company or, if applicable, the Successor Company shall have delivered to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation,
merger, amalgamation, sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or disposition and such
supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments, if any, comply with the Indenture;
_provided that (x) in giving such opinion such counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to_
compliance with the foregoing clauses (3) and (4) and as to any matters of fact and (y) no
Opinion of Counsel will be required for any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or disposition described in the immediately succeeding
paragraph of this covenant.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for the Company or the Co-Issuer,
as the case may be, under the Indenture and the Notes, as applicable and in such event the Company
or the Co-Issuer, as the case may be, will automatically be released and discharged from its
obligations under the Indenture and the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4),

(1) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate, merge or amalgamate with or into or sell,
assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to
the Company, the Co-Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, and

(2) the Company or the Co-Issuer may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into an
Affiliate thereof solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing such Person as a
European Company (Societas Europaea) or in another jurisdiction (provided that such other
jurisdiction is the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory
thereof, or any member state of the European Union) so long as the amount of Indebtedness of
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby.

Notwithstanding the foregoing two paragraphs, the consummation of the Acquisition and the
Post-Closing Restructuring Transactions will be permitted under the Indenture with the only
requirement under this covenant with respect to the consummation of the Acquisition and the PostClosing Restructuring Transactions being that, after consummation of the Acquisition and the PostClosing Restructuring Transactions, Solera Holdings, Inc. expressly assumes all the obligations of
Summertime Acquisition Corp. under the Indenture and the Notes.

The Co-Issuer will not, and the Company will not permit the Co-Issuer to, merge, consolidate or
amalgamate with or into or wind up into (whether or not the Co-Issuer is the surviving Person), or sell,
assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets,
in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless concurrently therewith, a Subsidiary of the
Company that is a corporation organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state
thereof or the District of Columbia (which may be the Co-Issuer or the continuing person as a result of
such transaction) expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Co-Issuer under the Notes and the
Indenture. Upon the consummation of any transaction effected in accordance with this paragraph, the
resulting, surviving or transferee co-issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise
every right and power of, the Co-Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes with the same effect as if
such successor Person had been named as the Co-Issuer in the Indenture. Upon such substitution, the
Co-Issuer will be released from its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon
the sale, disposition or transfer of the Capital Stock of a Guarantor, no Guarantor will, and the
Company will not permit any such Guarantor to, consolidate, merge, amalgamate with or into or wind
up into (whether or not the Company or such Guarantor is the surviving Person), or sell, assign,
transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets
(determined on a consolidated basis), in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) (a) such Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any
such consolidation, merger or amalgamation (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale,

198

assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a European
Company (Societas Europaea) or a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability
company or trust or similar entity organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
organization of such Guarantor, as the case may be, or the laws of the United States, any state
thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof, or any member state of the European
Union (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor
_Person”);_

(b) the Successor Person (including a Successor Person that is a Foreign Subsidiary
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture), if other than such Guarantor,
expressly assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor under the Indenture and such
Guarantor’s related Guarantee pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or
instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(c) immediately after such transaction, no Default exists (and treating any
Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Successor Person or any of its Subsidiaries
as a result of such transaction as having been incurred by the Successor Person or such
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction); and

(d) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, amalgamation, sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition and such supplemental
indentures or other documents or instruments, if any, comply with the Indenture; or

(2) the transaction is made in compliance with the covenant described above under the
caption “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.”

In the case of clause (1) above, the Successor Person will succeed to, and be substituted for,
such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee, and in the case of clause (1) or
(2) above, such Guarantor will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the
Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Guarantor may
(i) merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or, wind up into with or transfer all or part of its properties
and assets to another Guarantor or the Issuers, (ii) merge into, consolidate with, wind up into or
transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any Restricted Subsidiary that is not an Issuer or a
Guarantor; provided that the surviving entity (x) is a European Company (Societas Europaea) or a
corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust or similar entity organized
or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor or the laws of the United
States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof, or any member state of the
European Union and (y) is or becomes a Guarantor upon the consummation of such transaction,
(iii) merge with an Affiliate of an Issuer solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing the
Guarantor as a European Company (Societas Europaea) or in another jurisdiction (provided that such
jurisdiction is the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof, or
any member state of the European Union), so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby, (iv) convert into a Person organized or existing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of such Guarantor or any of the jurisdictions set forth in clause (ii) of
this sentence or (v) liquidate or dissolve or change its legal form if the Company or any Parent Entity
on behalf of the Company determines in good faith that such liquidation or dissolution is in the best
interests of the Company and is not materially disadvantageous to the Holders, in each case, without
regard to the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraph.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment
to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any

(2) the Company delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of
related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $50.0

syndicated bank indebtedness or any capital markets debt securities of the Company, the Co-Issuer or
any Guarantor (other than Indebtedness payable to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) in an
aggregate principal amount in excess of $50.0 million (such indebtedness under (i) and (ii) of this
paragraph, the “Triggering Indebtedness”) unless such Restricted Subsidiary shall within 60 days
execute, and deliver to the Trustee, a supplemental indenture (a “Guarantor Supplemental Indenture”)
substantially in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary shall
unconditionally Guarantee all of the Company’s Obligations under the Notes and the Indenture on the
terms set forth in the Indenture, except that with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the
Company, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor (x) if the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee are
subordinated in right of payment to such Indebtedness, the Guarantee under the supplemental
indenture shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee with respect to such
Indebtedness substantially to the same extent as the Notes are subordinated to such Indebtedness
and (y) if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or
such Guarantor’s Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such
Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee substantially to the same
extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes; provided that (1) to the extent that any
Excluded Subsidiary no longer satisfies the definition of Excluded Subsidiary as of the end of the most
recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements have been provided in accordance with the
covenant described below under the caption “—Reports and Other Information,” then the Company
shall cause, within 60 days of delivery of such financial statements, such Restricted Subsidiary to
execute and deliver to the Trustee a Guarantor Supplemental Indenture, (2) to the extent any Foreign
Subsidiary guarantees the payment of any Triggering Indebtedness, the Company shall cause, within
60 days of such guarantee, such Foreign Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Trustee a Guarantor
Supplemental Indenture, (3) the Guarantee of any Foreign Subsidiary may be limited as to its full and
unconditional nature as required by the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Foreign
Subsidiary and (4) this covenant shall not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary
that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in
connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted
Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes if the guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would reasonably be
expected to give rise to or result in a violation of applicable law or any liability for the officers, directors,
managers or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary that, in any case, cannot be prevented or
otherwise avoided through measures reasonably available to the Company or the Restricted
Subsidiary.

205


-----

The Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise
required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary shall not be required
to comply with the 60 day period described above. Each Guarantee of a Guarantor shall be released in
accordance with the above provisions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this covenant shall not prohibit a guarantee or pledge by a Foreign
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor securing the payment of Indebtedness of another Foreign Subsidiary
that is not a Guarantor.

the Issue Date; provided, however, that no such report will be required to be furnished if the
Company determines in its good faith judgment that such event is not material to Holders or the
business, assets, operations, financial positions or prospects of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, further, that instead of providing such information
pursuant to this clause (3), the Company will be deemed to have satisfied this requirement by
providing the information in any report delivered pursuant to clauses (1) or (2) within 15 Business
Days after the occurrence of such event.

In addition, no report prepared pursuant to this covenant will be required (1) to include any exhibit
(including any agreements, financial statements or other items that would be required to be filed as an
exhibit), or (2) to include a summary of the terms of, any employment or compensatory arrangement
agreement, plan or understanding between the Company (or any Parent Entity or Subsidiaries) and
any director, manager or executive officer of the Company (or any Parent Entity or Subsidiaries).

206


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required (1) to comply with
Section 302, Section 404 or Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items 307 and
308 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, Regulation G promulgated by the SEC, Item 10(e) of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC (with respect to any non-GAAP financial measures contained
therein) or Items 402, 405, 406, 407 and 601 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, in each case
as in effect on the Issue Date, (2) to comply with Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC
or contain separate financial statements for the Company, the Guarantors or other Subsidiaries the
shares of which are pledged to secure the Notes or any Guarantee that would be required under
(a) Section 3-09 of Regulation S-X to the extent that the Company determines in its good faith
judgment that such information would not be material to the Holders or the business, assets,
operations, financial positions or prospects of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries,
(b) Section 3-10 of Regulation S-X or (c) Section 3-16 of Regulation S-X, respectively, promulgated by
the SEC, (3) to comply with any requirements of Regulation S-K or Regulation S-X promulgated by the
SEC to the extent such requirements were not complied with in this Offering Circular or to otherwise
provide any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical
disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Circular or (4) to provide financial statements in
interactive data format using the eXtensible Business Reporting Language.

The Company will make available such information and such reports to the Trustee under the
Indenture, to any Holder of the Notes and, upon request, to any beneficial owner of the Notes, in each
case by confidentially posting such information on any password-protected online data system, and will
make such information readily available on any password-protected online data system to any bona
fide prospective investor, any securities analyst (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the
Notes) or any bona fide market maker in the Notes (“Permitted Parties”) upon certification to the
Company as provided in the next succeeding paragraph. Any such password-protected online data
system may, at the Company’s option, require a confidentiality acknowledgement in order to access
the information and reports contained thereon. The Trustee shall have no responsibility or obligation
whatsoever to determine if such posting has occurred or for the content of such reports.

Any person who requests or accesses such financial information or seeks to participate in any
conference calls required by this covenant will be required to certify to the Company (to the Company’s
reasonable satisfaction) that:

(1) it is a Permitted Party;

(2) it will not use the information in violation of applicable securities laws or regulations;

(3) it will keep such reports and provided information confidential and will not communicate
the reports or information to any Person;

(4) it will not use such reports and the information contained therein for any purpose other
than their investment or potential investment in the Notes; and

(5) it will not use the information to compete with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
it is not a Person (which includes such Person’s Affiliates) that is principally engaged in a Similar
Business or that derives a significant portion of its revenues from the operation of a Similar
Business.

Within ten Business Days after the dates that the reports described in clauses (a) and (b) above
are furnished, the Company shall participate in quarterly conference calls to discuss operating results
and related matters, which conference call shall be open to all Holders, beneficial owners of a Note
and Permitted Parties that have certified to the Company their status as a Permitted Party.

The Company will also furnish to holders, securities analysts and prospective investors upon
request the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act,
so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act.

207


-----

The Company, at its option, may report at a Parent Entity’s level on a consolidated basis if such
Parent Entity is not engaged in any business in any material respect other than as incidental to its
ownership, directly or indirectly, of the capital stock of the Company. In such a case, the reports,
information and other documents required to be furnished to the Holders pursuant to this covenant
may, at the option of the Company, be filed by and be those of such parent rather than the Company;
_provided that, the same is accompanied by consolidating information, which may be unaudited, that_
explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such parent, on the
one hand, and the information relating to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone
basis, on the other hand. Such Parent Entity shall not be considered a Guarantor by virtue of providing
such reports. The obligations under this covenant may be satisfied by having the applicable reporting
entity file reports with the SEC containing the information contemplated hereunder within the
timeframes contemplated hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (a) the Company will not be deemed to have
failed to comply with any of its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “Events of
Default and Remedies” until 90 days after written notice described in clause (3) has been given and
(b) any failure to comply with this covenant shall be automatically cured when the Company or any
Parent Entity, as the case may be, provides all required reports to the holders of the Notes.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Company makes an election to change its
fiscal year, the Company will not be required to provide audited financial statements for the period from
the closing of the Company’s most recent fiscal year and the opening date of its newly selected fiscal
year (the “Transition Period”), nor will the Company be required to deliver a report on the financial
statements by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the
financial statements for such Transition Period. With respect to the Transition Period, the Company will
only be required to provide unaudited financial statements that have been reviewed pursuant to the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants procedures for a review of interim financial
information as described in AU Section 722, Interim Financial Information (or any successor provision)
for the Transition Period.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an Event of Default:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise,
of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the
Notes;

(3) (a) failure by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after receipt of
written notice given to the Company by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or
agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) or (2) above) contained in the
Indenture or the Notes;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by
which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance
of the Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such
Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods)
or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such

208


-----

Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such
Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated final maturity;
and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity
(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates to $70.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent) or more at any
one time outstanding;

(5) failure by the Company, the Co-Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of
Restricted Subsidiaries that taken together as of the date of the most recent audited financial
statements of the Company would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay non-appealable final
judgments aggregating in excess of $70.0 million (excluding amounts covered by insurance
provided by a carrier that has acknowledged coverage or amounts covered by valid third party
indemnification obligations from a third party which is solvent), which final judgments remain
unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment
becomes final and non-appealable, and, in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an
enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree
which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company, the Co-Issuer
or any other Significant Subsidiary; or

(7) the Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that taken
together as of the date of the most recent audited financial statements of the Company, would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect (except
as contemplated by the terms of the Indenture) or be declared null and void or any responsible
officer of such Guarantor, as the case may be, denies in writing that it has any further liability
under its Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination
of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture, and such
default continues for 10 Business Days.

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above with respect to the
Company or the Co-Issuer) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of
at least 30% in principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes may declare the principal,
premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be
due and payable immediately.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable
immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause
(6) of the first paragraph of this section with respect to the Company or the Co-Issuer, all outstanding
Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that the
Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default, except a
Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding
notice is in the Holders’ interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the
Notes if in the best judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the best interest of the Holders.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive
any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture and rescind any
acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with
any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the
payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder.

209


-----

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all
consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of the
acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any
action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose,

(x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been
discharged,

(y) the requisite holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as
the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default, or

(z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case
an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of
the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such
Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or
expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when
due, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have
requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any
loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof
and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have not given
the Trustee a written direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture, the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the total outstanding Notes are given the right to direct in writing the time, method and place
of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or
power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts
with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other
Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial
Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time
periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Reports and Other Information” or otherwise to deliver any
notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon
the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable,
even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide that the Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a
statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Company is required, within 30 days after
becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default, unless
such Default has been cured before the end of the 30-day period.

210


-----

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder,
member or limited partner of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any of their direct or indirect
parent companies shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuers or the Guarantors under the
Notes, the Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting Notes waives and releases all such liability.
Such waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not
be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such
a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under the Indenture, the Notes or the
Guarantees, as the case may be, will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released
upon payment in full of all of the Notes. The Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have
all of their obligations discharged with respect to the Notes and have each Guarantor’s obligation
discharged with respect to its Guarantee (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then existing Events of
Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to
the Indenture;

(2) the Issuers’ obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an
office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuers’
obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have their obligations and
those of each Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are
described in the Indenture and its Guarantee, as applicable (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter
any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default with
respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including
bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Issuers) described
under “Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to
the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes:

(1) the Issuers or any Guarantor must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the
benefit of the Holders of Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination
thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, a nationally recognized
investment bank or a nationally recognized appraisal or valuation firm, to pay the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest due on the Notes on the stated maturity date or on the redemption
date, as the case may be, of such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes, and the
Issuers must specify whether such Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular
redemption date; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable
Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that
an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the
date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount,

211


-----

the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the
date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate
delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that
confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(a) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the United States
Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or

(b) since the issuance of the Notes, there has been a change in the applicable U.S.
federal income tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject
to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and
will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee
an Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the
Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the
case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the
deposit was not made by the Issuers or any Guarantor with the intent of defeating, hindering,
delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuers or any Guarantor or others; and

(5) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion
of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions)
each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the
Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Opinion of Counsel required by clause (2) with respect to Legal
Defeasance need not be delivered if all of the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation (x) have become due and payable or (y) will become due and payable within one year or
are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the
giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuers.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes, when either:

(1) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes
which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been
deposited in trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(2) (a) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due
and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become due and
payable within one year or are to be called for redemption and redeemed within one year under
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in
the name, and at the expense, of the Issuers and the Issuers or any Guarantor have irrevocably
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit
of the Holders of Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in

212


-----

such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent
public accountants, a nationally recognized investment bank or a nationally recognized appraisal
or valuation firm, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest to pay and discharge the
entire indebtedness on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for
principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption; provided,
that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount
deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is
deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the
notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the
Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in
an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable
Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such
redemption;

(b) the Issuers have paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by them under the
Indenture; and

(c) the Issuers have delivered irrevocable written instructions to the Trustee to apply
the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or the redemption date,
as the case may be.

In addition, upon its request for written acknowledgement of satisfaction and discharge, the
Company must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating that all
conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied; provided that any such counsel
may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing
clauses (a), (b) and (c)).

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, any Guarantee and the
Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes, and any existing Default or Event of Default
or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, any Guarantee or the Notes issued thereunder may
be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes, other than Notes beneficially owned by the Company or its Affiliates, including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes.

The Indenture will provide that, without the consent of each affected Holder of Notes, an
amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes whose Holders
must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such Note or alter or
waive the provisions with respect to the redemption of such Notes (other than provisions relating
to the covenants described above under the caption “Repurchase at the Option of Holders” and
other than the notice provisions);

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or
interest on such Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of such Notes by the Holders of at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default
that resulted from such acceleration;

213


-----

(5) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to the rights of Holders to
receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes;

(7) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions;

(8) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or
with respect to such Holder’s Notes;

(9) make any change to or modify the ranking of such Notes that would adversely affect the
Holders; or

(10) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Guarantee of any
Significant Subsidiary in any manner adverse to the Holders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuers, any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee or the
Indenture to which it is a party) and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture and any
Guarantee or Notes without the consent of any Holder:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes
(provided that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of
Section 163(f) of the Code);

(3) to comply with the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Merger,
Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets;”

(4) to provide for the assumption of the Issuers’ or any Guarantor’s obligations to the
Holders;

(5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or
that does not materially adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder;

(6) to add covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power
conferred upon the Issuers or any Guarantor;

(7) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a
successor Trustee or a successor paying agent thereunder pursuant to the requirements thereof;

(8) to provide for the issuance of exchange Notes or private exchange Notes, which are
identical to exchange Notes except that they are not freely transferable;

(9) to provide for the succession of any parties to the Indenture (and other amendments that
are administrative or ministerial in nature);

(10) to add a Guarantor or release any Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture;

(11) to conform the text of the Indenture, Guarantees or the Notes to any provision of this
“Description of Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of Notes” was intended
to be a substantially verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, Guarantee or Notes;

(12) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and
legending of Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the
issuance and administration of the Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the
Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities
Act or any applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not materially and adversely
affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes;

214


-----

(13) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture;

(14) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant any other Lien in favor of the Trustee for the
benefit of the Holders, as security for the payment and performance of all or any portion of the
Notes, in any property or assets; or

(15) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment, waiver or consent. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of
the proposed amendment, waiver or consent.

**Notices**

Notices given by publication or, if a method of electronic delivery is approved by the Trustee,
such electronic delivery will be deemed given on the first date on which publication or electronic
delivery is made, and notices given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given five
calendar days after mailing. Notice otherwise given in accordance with the procedures of DTC will be
deemed given on the date sent to DTC.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it
become a creditor of the Issuers or any Guarantor, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to
realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee
will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must
eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes issued thereunder will have the right to direct in writing the time, method and place of conducting
any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The
Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default shall occur (which shall not be cured), the
Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in
the conduct of his own affairs.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and any Guarantee will be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York.

**Certain Definitions**

Set forth below are certain defined terms to be used in the Indenture. For purposes of the
Indenture, unless otherwise specifically indicated, the term “consolidated” with respect to any Person
refers to such Person on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, but with its Restricted
Subsidiaries, and excluding from such consolidation any Unrestricted Subsidiary as if such
Unrestricted Subsidiary were not an Affiliate of such Person.

“Acquired Indebtedness” means, with respect to any specified Person,

(1) Indebtedness of any other Person existing at the time such other Person is merged or
amalgamated with or into or became a Restricted Subsidiary of such specified Person, including
Indebtedness assumed or incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such other Person
merging or amalgamating with or into or becoming a Restricted Subsidiary of such specified
Person, and

215


-----

(2) Indebtedness secured by a Lien encumbering any asset acquired by such specified
Person;

_provided that any Indebtedness of such other Person that is extinguished, redeemed, defeased, retired_
or otherwise repaid at the time of or immediately upon consummation of the transaction pursuant to
which such other Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the specified Person will not be Acquired
Indebtedness.

“Acquisition” means the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

a financing or capital lease would be the amount required to be reflected as a liability on such balance

redemption, retirement or extinguishment of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of

229


-----

Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (in each case, including a pro forma application of the net
proceeds therefrom), as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the Applicable Measurement
Period; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation shall not give effect to any Indebtedness
incurred on such determination date pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph
(other than pursuant to clause (14)) under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers (including the Acquisition), amalgamations, consolidations and disposed or
discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP) that have been made by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Applicable Measurement Period or
subsequent to such Applicable Measurement Period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the
Applicable Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such
Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and disposed or
discontinued operations (and the change in any associated Fixed Charges and the change in EBITDA
resulting therefrom, without duplication of the adjustments set forth in the definition of “EBITDA”) had
occurred on the first day of the Applicable Measurement Period. If since the beginning of such period
any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged or amalgamated with or
into the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have
made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, disposed or
discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such Applicable
Measurement Period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation or disposed or discontinued operation had occurred at the beginning of the Applicable
Measurement Period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro
_forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the_
Company and may include, without duplication, cost savings, operating expense reductions,
restructuring charges and expenses and cost-saving synergies resulting from any Asset Sale or other
disposition or such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation or consolidation or
discontinued operation or other transaction (including the Transactions), in each case calculated in a
manner consistent with clause (1)(k) of the definition of “EBITDA.” For the avoidance of doubt, the
actual adjustments set forth in the computation of “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” as described in this
Offering Circular shall be deemed to comply with the standards set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the
interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Applicable Calculation
Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any obligations under Swap
Agreements applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Financing Lease Obligation shall be
deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting
officer of the Company to be the rate of interest implicit in such Financing Lease Obligation in
accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any
Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based
upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period except as set forth
in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at
an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or
other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based
upon such optional rate as the Company or the Co-Issuer may designate.

“Foreign Subsidiary” means, with respect to any Person, any Restricted Subsidiary other than a
Domestic Subsidiary.

“GAAP” means (1) generally accepted accounting principles in the United States as in effect from
time to time; provided that all terms of an accounting or financial nature used in the Indenture shall be
construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to in the Indenture shall be made
(a) without giving effect to any election under FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 825—
_Financial Instruments, or any successor thereto (including pursuant to the FASB Accounting Standards_
Codification), to value any Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary at “fair value,” as defined
therein and (b) the amount of any Indebtedness under GAAP with respect to Financing Lease
Obligations shall be determined in accordance with the definition of Financing Lease Obligation or (2) if
elected by the Company (the “IFRS Election”) by written notice to the Trustee in connection with the
delivery of financial statements and information, the accounting standards and interpretations adopted
by the International Accounting Standard Board (“IFRS”), as in effect on the first date of the period for
which the Company is making such election; provided, that (a) any such election, once made, shall be
irrevocable and (b) from and after the date of the IFRS Election, (i) all financial statements and reports
required to be provided after such election pursuant to the Indenture shall be prepared on the basis of
IFRS, (ii) all ratios, financial definitions, computations and other determinations based on GAAP
contained in the Indenture shall be computed in conformity with IFRS, (iii) all references in the
Indenture to GAAP shall be deemed to be references to IFRS, (iv) all references in the Indenture to the
Financial Accounting Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants or any
successor thereto shall be deemed to be references to the International Accounting Standards Board
or any successor thereto and (v) accounting terms not defined in the Indenture shall have the
respective meanings given to them under IFRS; provided that any such term phrased in a manner
customary under GAAP shall be interpreted to refer to the equivalent accounting or financial concept
under IFRS and, if there is no such equivalent accounting or financial concept, shall be interpreted in a
manner that best approximates the effect that such term would have if it were construed in accordance
with GAAP as in effect on the Issue Date. For the avoidance of doubt, solely making an election
(without any other action) referred to in this definition will not be treated as an incurrence of
Indebtedness.

If there occurs a change in generally accepted accounting principles relating to revenue
recognition resulting from the joint revenue recognition standard of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board and the International Accounting Standards Board, and such change would cause a change in
the method of calculation of standards or terms as determined in good faith by the Company (an
“Accounting Change”), then the Company may elect, as evidenced by a written notice of the Company
to the Trustee, that such standards or terms shall be calculated as if such Accounting Change had not
occurred.

249


-----

**BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

The notes are being offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A
(“Rule 144A Notes”). Notes also may be offered and sold in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S (“Regulation S Notes”). Except as set forth below, notes will be issued in registered,
global form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
Notes will be issued at the closing of this offering only against payment in immediately available funds.

Rule 144A Notes initially will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). Regulation S Notes initially will
be represented by one or more temporary global notes in registered form without interest coupons
(collectively, the “Temporary Regulation S Global Notes”). The Temporary Regulation S Global Notes
will be exchangeable for permanent global notes (the “Permanent Regulation S Global Notes” and,
together with the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes”) after the
expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (as defined below). The Rule 144A Global Notes and
the Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to herein as the “Global Notes.” The Global
Notes will be deposited upon issuance with the Trustee as custodian for The Depository Trust
Company (“DTC”), and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to an
account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below.

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this offering and the
closing of this offering (such period through and including such 40th day, the “Distribution Compliance
Period”), beneficial interests in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes may be held only through
Euroclear and Clearstream (each as defined below) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless
transferred to a person that takes delivery through a Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with the
certification requirements described below.

Beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests
in the Regulation S Global Notes at any time except in the limited circumstances described below. See
“—Exchanges Among Global Notes.”

Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to
another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the Global
Notes may not be exchanged for notes in certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) except in the limited
circumstances described below. See “—Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes.” Except in
the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not
be entitled to receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form.

Rule 144A Notes (including beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes) will be subject to
certain restrictions on transfer and will bear a restrictive legend as described under “Transfer
Restrictions.” Regulation S Notes will also be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and will also
bear the legend as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of beneficial interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or
indirect participants (including, if applicable, those of Euroclear or Clearstream), which may change
from time to time.

**Depositary Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC is provided solely as a matter
of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations
and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these
matters.

251


-----

DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the
State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a
member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform
Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the
Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the
“participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between
participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants. The participants
include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies,
clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to
other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “indirect
participants”). Persons who are not participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of
DTC only through the participants or the indirect participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers
of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the
participants and indirect participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of participants designated by
the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of
ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with
respect to the participants) or by the participants and the indirect participants (with respect
to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes).

Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are participants in DTC’s system may hold their
interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not
participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and
Clearstream) which are participants in such system. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must
initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such
systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes
through participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and
Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through
customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories,
which are Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of
Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC.
Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and
requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical
delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial
interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on
behalf of participants, which in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a Person having
beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the
DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a
physical certificate evidencing such interests.

**Except as described below, owners of an interest in the Global Notes will not have notes**
**registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will**
**not be considered the registered owners or “holders” thereof under the indenture for any**
**purpose.**

252


-----

Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on a Global Note
registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered
holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, the Issuers and the Trustee will treat the
Persons in whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such
notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the
Issuers, the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuers or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or
liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating to
or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect
participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its participants or
indirect participants.

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities
such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant participants
with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on
such payment date. Each relevant participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial
ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of
DTC. Payments by the participants and the indirect participants to the beneficial owners of notes will
be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the
participants or the indirect participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the
Issuers. Neither the Issuers nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its participants
in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and the Issuers and the Trustee may conclusively rely
on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between
participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in sameday funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in
accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

DTC has advised the Issuers that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes
only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the
Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to
which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of
Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in
certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its participants.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein,
cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream
participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf
of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such
cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within
the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may
be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective
depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the
relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures
for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants
may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

253


-----

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or changed at any time. Neither the Issuers nor the Trustee nor any of their respective
agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their
respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Notes if:

(1) DTC (a) notifies the Issuers that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the
Global Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act
and, in each case, a successor depositary is not appointed;

(2) the Issuers, at their option, notify the Trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of
the Certificated Notes; or

(3) there has occurred and is continuing a Default with respect to the notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon
prior written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture. In all
cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global
Notes will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on
behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable
restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by applicable
law. In no event shall the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes be exchanged for Certificated Notes
prior to (a) the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period and (b) the receipt of any certificates
required under the provisions of Regulation S.

**Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes**

Certificated Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the
effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes.
See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Exchanges Among Global Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in the
Regulation S Global Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Note only
if:

(1) such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the relevant notes pursuant to
Rule 144A; and

(2) the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the
indenture) to the effect that the relevant notes are being transferred to a Person:

(a) who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the
meaning of Rule 144A;

(b) purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional buyer in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

254


-----

(c) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and
other jurisdictions.

Beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery
in the form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the
Distribution Compliance Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in
the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the
expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, the interest transferred will be held immediately
thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests among the Regulation S Global Notes and
the Rule 144A Global Notes will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the
Trustee through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any
such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts of
the Regulation S Global Note and the Rule 144A Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in
one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in
another Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an
interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions
and other procedures applicable to beneficial interest in such other Global Note for so long as it
remains such an interest. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial
interests in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period.

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

The Issuers will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes
(including principal, premium, if any, and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts specified by the Global Note holder. The Issuers will make all payments of principal, interest
and premium, if any, with respect to Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the accounts specified by the holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no such account is specified, by
mailing a check to each such holder’s registered address. The notes represented by the Global Notes
are expected to be made eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any
permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be
settled in immediately available funds. The Issuers expect that secondary trading in any Certificated
Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream
participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a DTC participant will be credited, and any
such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the
securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream)
immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised the Issuers that cash received in
Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or
Clearstream participant to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but
will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for
Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income and, in the case of non-U.S.
holders (as defined below), estate tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the
notes as of the date of this offering circular. This summary deals only with notes held as capital assets
by holders who are treated as acquiring the notes for cash upon original issuance at their “issue price”
(the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes of the applicable series is sold for money to
investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the
capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler).

As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes that is for United States
federal income tax purposes any of the following:

‰ an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

‰ a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or
the District of Columbia;

‰ an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of
its source; or

‰ a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one
or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust
or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be
treated as a United States person.

Except as modified for estate tax purposes (as discussed below), as used herein, the term “nonU.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes (other than an entity treated as a partnership for
United States federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. holder.

If any entity classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds the
notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an
investment in the notes, you should consult your own tax advisors.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax
consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal
income tax laws, including if you are:

‰ a dealer in securities or currencies;

‰ a financial institution;

‰ a regulated investment company;

‰ a real estate investment trust;

‰ a tax-exempt organization;

‰ an insurance company;

‰ a person holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale
transaction or a straddle;

‰ a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your
securities;

‰ a person liable for alternative minimum tax;

‰ a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes (or a
person who is an investor in such an entity);

261


-----

‰ a U.S. holder whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

‰ a “controlled foreign corporation”;

‰ a “passive foreign investment company”; or

‰ a United States expatriate.

This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof.
Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in United States
federal income and estate tax consequences different from those summarized below.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income and
estate tax consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the
Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, the United States federal gift tax or the effects of
any state, local or non-United States tax laws. It is not intended to be, and should not be construed to
be, legal or tax advice to any particular purchaser of notes. If you are considering purchasing notes,
**you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular United States federal**
**income and estate tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the**
**notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under any other federal tax laws and the laws**
**of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will
apply to you if you are a U.S. holder of the notes.

**_Payments of interest._** Stated interest on the notes will generally be taxable to you as United
States source ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on your method of
accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.

**_Sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note._** _Upon the sale, exchange,_
_retirement or other taxable disposition of a note, you generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the_
_difference between the amount realized upon the disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued and_
_unpaid interest, which will be treated as a payment of interest for United States federal income tax_
_purposes) and your adjusted tax basis in the note. Your adjusted tax basis in a note generally will be_
_your cost for that note increased by any OID previously included in income. Any gain or loss generally_
_will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in_
_respect of capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The_
_deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss you recognize will generally be_
_treated as United States source gain or loss._

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The notes will be treated as issued with OID for United States federal income tax purposes in an
amount equal to the difference between their stated principal amount and their “issue price” (as defined
above). As a result, you generally must include the OID in gross income (as ordinary income) as it
accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis), in advance of the receipt of the cash attributable to that
income, regardless of your regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax
purposes.

The amount of OID that you must include in income for any taxable year with respect to a note
will generally equal the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the note for each day during

262


-----

such taxable year (or portion thereof) on which you held that note (“accrued OID”). The daily portion is
determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to
that accrual period. The “accrual period” for a note may be of any length and may vary in length over
the term of the note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled
payment of principal and interest occurs on the first day or the final day of an accrual period.

The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period other than the final accrual period is an
amount equal to the excess of

‰ the note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of the accrual period multiplied by its yield to
maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and
properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period, over

‰ the aggregate of any stated interest allocable to the accrual period.

OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the stated principal amount and
the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. Special rules will apply for
calculating OID for an initial short accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a note at the beginning
of any accrual period is equal to its issue price increased by the accrued OID, if any, for each prior
accrual period. Under these rules, you generally will have to include in income increasingly greater
amounts of OID in successive accrual periods.

The rules governing OID are complex. You are strongly urged to consult your own tax advisors
regarding the application of these rules in light of your particular circumstances.

**Non-U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income and estate tax consequences
that will apply to you if you are a non-U.S. holder of the notes.

**_United States Federal Withholding Tax_**

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, United States federal
withholding tax will not apply to any payment of interest on the notes (which, for purposes of this
discussion of non-U.S. holders, includes any OID) under the “portfolio interest rule,” provided that:

‰ interest paid on the notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business
in the United States;

‰ you do not actually (or constructively) own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of
all classes of voting stock of Parent or the Co-Issuer within the meaning of the Code and
applicable United States Treasury regulations;

‰ you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to Parent or the Co-Issuer through
stock ownership;

‰ you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A)
of the Code; and

‰ either (a) you provide your name and address on an applicable IRS Form W-8, and certify,
under penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person as defined under the Code
or (b) you hold your notes through certain foreign intermediaries and satisfy the certification
requirements of applicable United States Treasury regulations. Special certification rules apply
to non-U.S. holders that are pass-through entities rather than corporations or individuals.

263


-----

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be
subject to a 30% United States federal withholding tax, unless you provide the applicable withholding
agent with a properly executed:

‰ IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable form) certifying an exemption from or
reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty; or

‰ IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) certifying that interest paid on the notes is not
subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or
business in the United States (as discussed below under “United States Federal Income Tax”).

The 30% United States federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any payment of principal
or gain that you realize on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
note.

**_United States Federal Income Tax_**

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the notes is
effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment), then you will be subject
to United States federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis (although you will be exempt
from the 30% United States federal withholding tax, provided the certification requirements discussed
above in “—United States Federal Withholding Tax” are satisfied) in generally the same manner as if
you were a United States person as defined under the Code. In addition, if you are a foreign
corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax
treaty rate) of your effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to certain adjustments.

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, any gain realized on the sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note generally will not be subject to
United States federal income tax unless:

‰ the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent
establishment), in which case you generally will be subject to United States federal income tax
(and possibly branch profits tax) on such gain in the same manner as described above with
respect to effectively connected interest; or

‰ you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable
year of that disposition, and certain other conditions are met, in which case you will be subject
to United States federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable
income tax treaty) on such gain (net of certain United States source losses).

**_United States Federal Estate Tax_**

If you are an individual who is neither a citizen nor a resident (as specifically defined for
United States federal estate tax purposes) of the United States at the time of your death, your estate
will not be subject to United States federal estate tax on notes beneficially owned (or deemed to be
beneficially owned) by you at the time of your death, provided that any interest payment to you on the
notes would be eligible for exemption from United States federal withholding tax under the “portfolio
interest rule,” described above under “—United States Federal Withholding Tax,” without regard to the
statement requirement described in the fifth bullet point of that section.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

**_U.S. Holders_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest on the
notes (including OID) and the proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement
or redemption) of a note paid to you (unless you are an exempt recipient). Backup withholding may
apply to such payments if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number or a certification that
you are not subject to backup withholding, or if you have failed to report in full interest and dividend
income.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax
liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Interest (including OID) paid to you and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those
payments generally will be reported to the IRS. Copies of the information returns reporting such
interest payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country
in which you reside under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. In general, you will not be
subject to backup withholding with respect to payments of interest on the notes (including OID) that we
make to you provided that the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason
to know that you are a United States person as defined under the Code, and such withholding agent
has received from you the required certification that you are a non-U.S. holder described above in the
fifth bullet point under “Non-U.S. Holders—United States Federal Withholding Tax.”

Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the
proceeds of a sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of notes within the United
States or conducted through certain United States-related financial intermediaries, unless you certify to
the payor under penalties of perjury that you are a non-U.S. holder (and the payor does not have
actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person as defined under the Code),
or you otherwise establish an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax
liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Additional Withholding Requirements**

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as “FATCA”),
a 30% United States federal withholding tax may apply to any interest income (including OID) paid on the
notes and, for a disposition of a note occurring after December 31, 2018, the gross proceeds from such
disposition, in each case paid to (i) a “foreign financial institution” (as specifically defined in the Code)
which does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either
(x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y) its compliance (or deemed compliance) with FATCA (which may
alternatively be in the form of compliance with an intergovernmental agreement with the United States) in
a manner which avoids withholding, or (ii) a “non-financial foreign entity” (as specifically defined in the
Code) which does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing
either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y) adequate information regarding certain substantial United
States beneficial owners of such entity (if any). If an interest payment is both subject to withholding under
FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under “Non-U.S. Holders—United States

265


-----

Federal Withholding Tax,” the withholding under FATCA may be credited against, and therefore reduce,
such other withholding tax. If you are a foreign financial institution or a non-financial foreign entity
organized in a jurisdiction that has entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the United States
regarding FATCA, you may be subject to different rules. You should consult your own tax advisors
regarding these rules and whether they may be relevant to your ownership and disposition of the notes.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of
the notes by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other
arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”) or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or
regulations that are similar to such provisions of the Code or ERISA (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and
entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan, account or
arrangement (each, a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to
Part 4 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain
transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under
ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the
administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an
ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA
Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the
Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s
duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in
specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within
the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code,
unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under
ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt
prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The
acquisition and/or holding of notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuers, a guarantor or
an initial purchaser is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in
a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code,
unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or
individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued
prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the acquisition and holding of
the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions
determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance
company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE
95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions
determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor
any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or
render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction
and provided further that the ERISA Plan receives no less, nor pays no more, than adequate

267


-----

consideration in connection with the transaction. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains
conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Plans considering acquiring and/or holdings
the notes in reliance of these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to assure it
is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be
satisfied.

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing
“plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a note will be
deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such
purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of any
Plan or (ii) the purchase and holding of the notes (or any interest therein) by such purchaser or
transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive nor should it
be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be
imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that
fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any
Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the
Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the
purchase and holding of the notes. Purchasers have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their
purchase and holding of the notes do not violate the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction
rules of ERISA, the Code, or any applicable Similar Laws. Except as otherwise stated herein, the sale
of any notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by the Issuers, an initial purchaser, or any of
their respective affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all legal requirements with
respect to such investments by any such Plan generally or any particular Plan, or that such investment
is appropriate for such Plans generally or any particular Plan.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuers and the initial purchasers will enter into a purchase agreement with respect to the
notes. Subject to certain conditions, each initial purchaser has severally agreed to purchase the
respective principal amount of notes indicated opposite its name as set forth in the following table.

The initial purchasers are committed to take and pay for all of the notes being offered, if any are
taken. The initial offering price is set forth on the cover page of this offering circular. After the notes are
released for sale, the initial purchasers may change the offering price and other selling terms. The
offering of the notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the
initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. Each initial
purchaser has agreed that it will only offer or sell the notes (A) in the United States to qualified
institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and (B) outside the
United States to non-United States persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under
the Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation
S under the Securities Act.

In connection with sales outside the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed that they
will not offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or for the account or benefit of, United States persons (i) as
part of the initial purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the
commencement of the offering or the date the notes are originally issued. The initial purchasers will
send to each dealer to whom it sells such notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other
notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the United States or to, or for
the account or benefit of, United States persons.

In addition, with respect to notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the
later of the commencement of this offering or the date the notes are originally issued, an offer or sale
of such notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act.

The Issuers and the guarantors will agree in the purchase agreement, subject to certain
exceptions, that for a period of 90 days after the date of this offering circular, neither it nor any of the
guarantors will, without the prior written consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co., offer, sell, contract to sell or
otherwise dispose of any securities that are substantially similar to the notes.

The notes are new issuances of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend
to list the notes on any national securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated

269


-----

dealer quotation system. There can be no assurance that the prices at which the notes will sell in the
market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market
for the notes will develop and continue after this offering. We have been advised by the initial
purchasers that the initial purchasers intend to make a market in the notes but are not obligated to do
so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to
the liquidity of the trading market for the notes.

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open
market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover
positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater
number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of
certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price
of the notes while the offering is in progress.

The initial purchasers also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular initial
purchaser repays to the initial purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because
Goldman, Sachs & Co. or its affiliates have repurchased notes sold by or for the account of such initial
purchaser in stabilizing or short covering transactions.

These activities by the initial purchasers, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for
their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the notes. As a
result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open
market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the initial purchasers at any
time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

The Issuers and the guarantors have agreed to indemnify the several initial purchasers against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

An investor has indicated an interest in acquiring notes and has negotiated separate terms with
Goldman, Sachs & Co. for an option to acquire $400 million of notes prior to March 31, 2016.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. will earn fees and expenses in connection with the option, and will be allocated
$400 million in connection with the offering so that it can deliver notes pursuant to the option, if
exercised. The payment and other terms of this option are different from, and could be deemed more
favorable to such investor than, the initial offering terms as described herein.

**Relationships**

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged
in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking,
advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market
making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Certain of the initial
purchasers and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a variety of
these services to the Issuers and to persons and entities with relationships with the Issuers, for which
they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. The initial purchasers have, from time to
time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking
services for us, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In addition,
Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as an initial purchaser in Audatex’s offering of the 2021 Senior Notes in
July 2013, the 2021 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes in November 2013, the 2021 Senior Notes in
May 2014, the 2021 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes in November 2014 and the 2023 Senior
Notes in July 2015. An affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co. is a party to certain of our financial derivative
transactions. It is possible that such financial derivative transactions may be impacted by the
Transactions, and the resulting payments in connection therewith could be material. Investment funds

270


-----

or accounts managed or advised by an affiliate of KKR Capital Markets LLC and MCS Capital Markets
LLC are existing holders of the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes. The initial purchasers or
their respective affiliates have committed to become agents, arrangers, bookrunners, managers or
lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In addition, the initial purchasers or their
respective affiliates have also agreed to provide interim financing to us under certain circumstances in
the event the offering is not consummated, for which these initial purchasers will be paid customary
fees. An affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co. has committed to make a preferred equity investment in
Parent in connection with the Transactions. In addition, Goldman, Sachs & Co. is acting as dealer
manager in connection with the Tender Offer and the Consent Solicitation related to the Existing Notes.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their
respective affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of
investments and actively traded securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default
swaps and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers,
and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or
instruments of the Issuers (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or
persons and entities with relationships with the Issuers. The initial purchasers and their respective
affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading
ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or
instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or
short positions in such assets, securities and instruments.

**European Economic Area**

In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the
Prospectus Directive (each, a “Relevant Member State”), the initial purchaser has represented and
agreed that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in
that Relevant Member State, no offer of notes to the public in that Relevant Member State may be
made other than:

(a) to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive;

(b) to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the
Prospectus Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive, subject to obtaining the
prior consent of the relevant Dealer or Dealers nominated by the Issuers for any such offer;
or

(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,

provided that no such offer of notes shall require the Issuers or the initial purchasers to publish a
prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant
to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of notes to the public” in relation to
any notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of
sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the notes to be offered so as to enable an investor
to decide to purchase or subscribe the notes, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any
measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State, the expression “Prospectus
Directive” means Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including the 2010 PD Amending
Directive, to the extent implemented in the Relevant Member State) and includes any relevant
implementing measure in the Relevant Member State, and the expression “2010 PD Amending
Directive” means Directive 2010/73/EU.

Each initial purchaser has represented and agreed that:

(a) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or
cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity

sale of the notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the
Issuers and the guarantors; and

anything done by it in relation to the notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

Companies Ordinance (Cap. 32, Laws of Hong Kong), and no advertisement, invitation or document
relating to the notes may be issued or may be in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue
(in each case whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere), which is directed at, or the contents of which are
likely to be accessed or read by, the public in Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under the laws
of Hong Kong) other than with respect to notes which are or are intended to be disposed of only to
persons outside Hong Kong or only to “professional investors” within the meaning of the Securities and
Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder.

Singapore. Accordingly, this offering circular and any other document or material in connection with the

**REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM**

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Solera Holdings, Inc.
Westlake, Texas

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Solera Holdings, Inc. and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements
of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and redeemable noncontrolling
interests, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2015. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index on page F-1. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Solera Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

Solera Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”, “Solera”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a leading
provider of risk and asset management software and services to the automotive and property
marketplace, including the global “property and casualty” (“P&C”) insurance industry. In addition to our
global-leading position in collision repair and our U.S. based mechanical repair presence, we provide
data driven productivity and decision support solutions to other aspects of vehicle ownership such as
vehicle validation, driver violation monitoring, vehicle salvage and electronic titling. We are also
expanding our core competencies of data, software and connectivity from the auto to the home. We
are active in over 75 countries across six continents.

Through our acquisition of the Insurance and Services Division of Pittsburgh Glass Works LLC
(“I&S”) in July 2014, we also provide software and business management tools, third-party claims
administration, first notice of loss and network management services to the U.S. auto and property
repair industries, specializing in glass claims. In addition, through our acquisition of CAP Automotive
(“CAP”) in November 2014, we provide valuation data and specification data for new and used vehicles
in the United Kingdom.

**_Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation_**

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles as set forth in the Financial Accounting
Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification and applicable regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our operating results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future periods.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
and majority-owned subsidiaries as well as Service Repair Solutions, Inc. (“SRS”). Our consolidated,
majority-owned subsidiaries include certain of our subsidiaries located in Belgium, France, Portugal,
Spain and Mexico. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

**2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

**_Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses are affected by estimates and assumptions which are used for, but not limited to, the
accounting for sales allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts, fair value of derivatives, valuation of
goodwill and intangible assets, amortization of intangibles, restructurings, liabilities under defined
benefit plans, share-based compensation, redeemable noncontrolling interests and income taxes.

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**

We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the time of
purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents at June 30, 2015 and 2014 consisted primarily of

F-8


-----

money market funds and bank certificates of deposit. The carrying amounts approximate fair value due
to the short maturities of these instruments.

**_Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts_**

Accounts receivable are recorded according to contractual agreements. Credit terms for payment
of products and services are extended to customers in the normal course of business and no collateral
is required. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on our historical losses, the
existing economic conditions, and the financial stability of our customers. Receivables are written-off in
the period that they are deemed uncollectible.

**_Property and Equipment_**

Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the
assets using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:

Buildings 20 to 40 years
Building improvements 5 to 15 years
Leasehold improvements Lesser of 10 years or remaining lease term
Data processing equipment 3 years
Furniture and fixtures 4 to 7 years
Machinery and equipment 3 to 6 years
Software licenses 3 to 5 years

**_Internal Use Software_**

We capitalize the direct and incremental costs incurred in developing or obtaining internal use
computer software as well as certain payroll and payroll-related costs of employees who are directly
associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalized payroll costs with
respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. The costs associated
with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage
activities are expensed as incurred. Additionally, we expense internal costs related to minor upgrades
and enhancements, as it is impractical to separate these costs from normal maintenance activities.

**_Contingent Purchase Consideration_**

Contingent future cash payments related to acquisitions are recognized at fair value as of the
acquisition date and included in the determination of the acquisition date purchase price. Subsequent
changes in the fair value of the contingent future cash payments are recognized in earnings in the
period that the change occurs.

**_Goodwill and Intangible Assets_**

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are
tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We perform our annual
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment on April 1 of each fiscal year.
Impairment indicators arise when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of the asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant downturn in industry or economic trends with
a direct impact on the business, an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed
of for less than the carrying value, loss of key personnel, or a significant decline in the market price of
an asset or asset group.

We test goodwill for impairment annually at a reporting unit level using a two-step process. The
first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with

F-9


-----

their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds
the reporting unit’s fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to
determine the amount of the potential impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test
involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value
of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an
impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

In our annual goodwill impairment assessment for fiscal year 2015, we concluded that the fair
values of the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned exceeded their respective carrying values
and, accordingly, we did not identify any goodwill impairment.

We test indefinite-lived intangible assets at the unit of accounting level by making a determination
of the fair value of the intangible asset. If the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying
value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference. We also evaluate the
remaining useful life of our intangible assets that are not subject to amortization on an annual basis to
determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If an
intangible asset that is not being amortized is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, that
asset is tested for impairment. After recognition of the impairment, if any, the asset is amortized
prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other
intangible assets that are subject to amortization.

In our annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment for fiscal year 2015, we
concluded that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying
value and, accordingly, we did not identify any impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Intangible assets with finite lives primarily consist of intangible assets acquired in business
combinations and the costs associated with software developed for internal use. We amortize
intangible assets with finite lives acquired in business combinations on an accelerated basis to reflect
the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed. Costs associated with
software developed for internal use are amortized over three- to five- years on a straight-line basis.

**_Impairment of Long-Lived Assets_**

We review long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives and property and
equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment
assessment include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group, a significant
adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used, the loss of
legal ownership or title to the asset, significant negative industry or economic trends or the presence of
other factors that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable.
We consider a long-lived asset to be impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting
from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of
the asset. If we deem an asset to be impaired, the amount of the impairment loss represents the
excess of the asset’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value.

**_Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Solera Holdings, Inc. Per Share_**

Our restricted stock units and performance share units have the right to receive non-forfeitable
dividends on an equal basis with common stock and therefore are considered participating securities
that must be included in the calculation of net income (loss) per share using the two-class method.
Under the two-class method, basic and diluted net income (loss) per share is determined by calculating
net income (loss) per share for common stock and participating securities based on the cash dividends
paid and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Diluted net income (loss) per share also

F-10


-----

considers the dilutive effect of in-the-money stock options and unvested restricted stock units and
performance share units that have the right to forfeitable dividends, calculated using the treasury stock
method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount of assumed proceeds from unexercised stock
options and unvested restricted stock units and performance share units that have the right to
forfeitable dividends includes the amount of compensation cost attributable to future services not yet
recognized, proceeds from the exercise of the options, and any excess income tax benefit or liability.

The computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) attributable to Solera Holdings, Inc. per
common share using the two-class method is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

**_Revenue Recognition_**

Revenues are recognized only after services are provided, when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, and when collectability is probable. Our multiple
element arrangements primarily include a combination of software licenses, hosted database and other
services, installation and set-up services, hardware, maintenance services and transaction-based
deliverables.

We generate a significant majority of our revenue from subscription-based contracts (where a
monthly fee is charged), transaction-based contracts (where a fee per transaction is charged) and
subscription-based contracts with additional transaction-based fees (where a monthly fee and a fee per
transaction are charged).

Subscription-based and transaction-based contracts generally include the delivery of software,
access to our database through a hosted service, upfront fees for the implementation and set-up
activities necessary for the client to use/access the software and maintenance. Under a subscription
arrangement, we consider delivery of software, access to the hosted database and maintenance to be
a combined unit of accounting and recognize related revenues at the end of each month upon the
completion of the monthly service. A transaction-based fee represents a payment for the right to use
the software, access to the hosted database and maintenance. We consider the fee to be fixed and
determinable only at the time actual usage occurs, and, accordingly, we recognize revenue at the time
of actual usage.

Implementation services and set-up activities are necessary for the client to receive services/
software. We defer up-front fees billed during the implementation/set-up phase and recognize such
revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated customer life. Recognition of this deferred revenue
will commence upon the start of the monthly service. Implementation and set-up costs that are direct
and incremental to the contract are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated customer life.

Revenues are reflected net of customer sales allowances, which are based on both specific
identification of certain accounts and a predetermined percentage of revenue based on historical
experience.

**_Sales and Related Taxes Collected_**

Sales and related taxes collected from customers and remitted to various governmental agencies
are excluded from reported revenues in our consolidated statements of income.

**_Cost of Revenues (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization)_**

Our costs and expenses applicable to revenues represent the total of operating expenses and
systems development and programming costs as presented on our consolidated statements of income.
Operating expenses include compensation and benefits costs for operations, database development
and customer service personnel, other costs related to operations, database development and
customer support functions, as well as third-party data and royalty costs, the cost of computer software
and hardware used directly in the delivery of our products and services and the costs of purchased
data from state departments of motor vehicles. Systems development and programming costs include
compensation and benefit costs for our product development and product management personnel,
other costs related to our product development and product management functions and costs related
to external software consultants involved in systems development and programming activities.

F-12


-----

**_Software Development Costs_**

Costs for the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing
software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at
which time any additional costs would be capitalized. The costs to develop such software have not
been capitalized as we believe our current software development process is essentially completed
concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility.

**_Acquisition and Related Costs_**

Acquisition and related costs include legal and other professional fees and other transaction costs
associated with completed and contemplated business combinations and asset acquisitions, costs
associated with integrating acquired businesses, including costs incurred to eliminate workforce
redundancies and for product rebranding, and other charges incurred as a direct result of our
acquisition efforts. These other charges include changes to the fair value of contingent purchase
consideration, acquired assets, and assumed liabilities subsequent to the completion of the purchase
price allocation, purchase consideration that is deemed to be compensatory in nature, and incentive
compensation arrangements with continuing employees of acquired companies.

**_Foreign Currency Translation_**

For each of our foreign subsidiaries, the local currency is its functional currency. Functional
currencies of significant foreign subsidiaries include Euros, British Pounds, Swiss francs, Canadian
dollars, Brazilian reals, and Mexican pesos.

We translate our local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates
prevailing during the reporting period for our consolidated statement of income and certain components
of stockholders’ equity, and the exchange rate at the end of that period for our consolidated balance
sheet. These translations resulted in net foreign currency translation adjustments of $(167.7) million and
$39.1 million in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. The foreign currency translation
adjustment in fiscal year 2015 was caused by a strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar versus
certain foreign currencies, including the Euro, during the period. Generally, this strengthening of the U.S.
dollar resulted in decreases to the U.S. dollar value of certain of our assets and liabilities from June 30,
2014 to June 30, 2015, as presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, although the
corresponding local currency balances may have increased or remain unchanged.

During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recognized net foreign currency
transaction gains (losses) in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income
(loss) of $(50.5) million, $11.0 million, and $(5.5) million, respectively.

**_Income Taxes_**

The provision for income taxes, income taxes payable and deferred income taxes are determined
using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured by
applying enacted tax rates and laws to taxable years in which such differences are expected to
reverse.

As part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate
our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the
completion and filing for tax returns for such periods. This process involves estimating actual current
tax expense together with assessing temporary differences, or reversing book-tax differences, resulting
from differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, for tax and accounting purposes. These
differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities.

F-13


-----

We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable using the morelikely-than-not standard. In our assessment, we consider all available evidence, both positive and
negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of
future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If we determine that
our deferred tax assets do not meet the more-likely-than-not standard, we establish a valuation
allowance. We exercise significant judgment relating to the projection of future taxable income. If
judgments regarding recoverability of deferred tax assets change in future periods, we may need to
adjust our valuation allowances, which could impact our results of operations in the period in which
such determination is made.

**_Derivative Financial Instruments_**

We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency
exposures. Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair
value. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge, the effective
portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are initially recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged
transactions occur and affect earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow and
net investment hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. Derivative instruments not
designated as hedges are marked-to-market at the end of each period with changes in fair value
recognized in earnings.

**_Advertising Costs_**

Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in selling, general and
administrative expenses. Total advertising costs were $12.1 million, $11.2 million and $9.1 million for
the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

**_Share-Based Compensation_**

We expense share-based payment awards in the period to which the services rendered for these
awards relate. These awards include stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units.
We estimate the grant date fair value of stock options with vesting contingent upon the achievement of
service conditions using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The grant date fair value of restricted
stock units with vesting contingent upon the achievement of service conditions and performance share
units with vesting contingent upon the achievement of performance conditions equals the intrinsic
value on the grant date. We estimate the grant date fair value of performance share units and stock
options with vesting contingent upon the achievement of market conditions using the Monte-Carlo
model, a generally accepted statistical technique used to simulate a range of possible future stock
prices.

Share-based compensation expense associated with stock options and restricted stock units with
vesting contingent upon the achievement of service conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period of the award, which generally equals the vesting period. Share-based
compensation expense associated with performance share units with vesting contingent upon the
achievement of performance conditions and performance share units and stock options with vesting
contingent upon the achievement of market conditions is recognized on an accelerated basis over the
derived service period. Share-based compensation expense associated with our employee stock
purchase plan is recognized over the applicable offering period on a straight-line basis. The amount of
share-based compensation expense recognized for share-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures
of unvested awards. No compensation cost is recorded for awards that do not vest, other than
performance share units and stock options with vesting contingent upon the achievement of market
conditions.

**_Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)_**

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation
adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, net of the related income tax
effect, and changes in the funded status of defined benefit pension plans, net of the related income tax
effect, that are excluded from the consolidated statements of income (loss) and are reported as a
separate component in stockholders’ equity.

**_Reclassifications_**

Share-based compensation expense for the previously reported periods has been reclassified
from a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statement of income (loss) to selling,
general and administrative expenses to conform with the current period presentation.

**_Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements_**

In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) Topic No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net
_Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists, which requires_
an entity to present certain unrecognized tax benefits as reductions to deferred tax assets rather than
as liabilities in balance sheets when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit
carryforward exists. ASU Topic No. 2013-11 does not affect the recognition or measurement of
uncertain tax positions under ASC 740. We adopted ASU Topic No. 2013-11 in the first quarter of our
fiscal year 2015. The adoption of ASU Topic No. 2013-11 did not impact our financial condition, results
of operations or cash flow.

**_New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted_**

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic No. 605, Revenue Recognition,

F-15

and most industry-specific guidance. This guidance primarily requires an entity to recognize revenue to
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In July
2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU Topic No. 2014-09 for one year. As a result, ASU
Topic No. 2014-09 will be effective for our fiscal year 2019. ASU Topic No. 2014-09 permits the use of
either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition
method and are currently evaluating the effect that ASU Topic No. 2014-09 will have on our financial
condition, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an
_Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to perform interim and_
annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of
issuance of the entity’s financial statements. ASU Topic No. 2014-15 is effective for our fiscal year
2017.

In April 2015, FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015-3, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835_30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs_
related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU Topic No. 2015-3 is effective
for our fiscal year 2017.

In April 2015, FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015- 5, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use
_Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement,_
which provides guidance to help entities determine whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a
software license and evaluate fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. ASU Topic
No. 2015-5 is effective for our fiscal year 2017.

**3. Business Combinations**

**_Fiscal Year 2015_**

**_Acquisition of CAP_**

On November 20, 2014, we acquired 100% of the equity interests of CAP, for approximately
£284.8 million ($449.7 million) in cash paid at closing. CAP is a provider of real-time, high-accuracy
valuations and specifications for new and used vehicles in the United Kingdom. CAP’s solutions
provide pricing transparency for vehicle transactions and enable buyers and sellers of vehicles to make
accurate pricing decisions. We financed the acquisition of CAP through the issuance of additional
senior unsecured notes as well as cash on hand. CAP has been assigned to our EMEA segment. We
have included the results of operations of CAP in our consolidated statements of income from the
acquisition date. Revenues and net income earned by CAP were $27.2 million and $3.4 million
respectively, for the period from the acquisition date through June 30, 2015.

We have accounted for the acquisition of CAP under the acquisition method of accounting and,
accordingly, the total purchase price has been allocated to the acquired tangible and identifiable
intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.
The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill. Of the
purchase price for CAP, we have preliminarily allocated £185.8 million $293.3 million to goodwill and
£122.7 million $193.6 million to identifiable intangible assets. The goodwill recorded in the acquisition
represents future enhancements to the software and database, future customer relationships and
markets, and the workforce. The goodwill recorded in the CAP acquisition is not expected to be tax
deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Acquisition of I&S_**

On July 29, 2014, we acquired 100% of the operating entities and other assets comprising I&S,
for approximately $279.4 million in cash paid at closing. Operating under the brand names of LYNX
Services, GTS Services, and GLAXIS, I&S is a leading provider of software and business management
tools, third-party claims administration, first notice of loss and network management services to the
U.S. auto and property repair industries, specializing in glass claims. The acquisition of I&S allows us
to expand our relationship with insurance companies in the U.S. and abroad with workflow tools and
third-party management services for glass, property, and collision claims as well as providing business
management solutions to a broad network of auto repair and flat glass retailers. I&S has been included
in our Americas segment. We have included the results of operations of I&S in our consolidated
statements of income from the acquisition date. Revenues earned and net loss incurred by I&S were
$57.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for the period from the acquisition date through June 30,
2015.

We have accounted for the acquisition of I&S under the acquisition method of accounting and,
accordingly, the total purchase price has been allocated to the acquired tangible and identifiable
intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.
The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill. Of the
purchase price for I&S, we have allocated $153.5 million to goodwill and $129.6 million to identifiable
intangible assets. The goodwill recorded in the acquisition represents future enhancements to the
software and database, future customer relationships and markets, and the workforce. All of the
goodwill recorded in the I&S acquisition is expected to be tax deductible.

The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of I&S (in
thousands):

**_Other Acquisitions_**

In addition to CAP and I&S, we acquired four businesses and substantially all of the assets of
another businesses for approximately $177.8 million in cash paid at closing and additional future cash
payments of up to $33.8 million contingent upon the achievement of certain financial performance,
product-related, integration and other objectives. Excluding CAP and I&S, the acquisitions completed
in fiscal year 2015 were immaterial both individually and in the aggregate.

**_Fiscal Year 2014_**

On November 13, 2013, we acquired a 50% equity ownership interest in SRS and its subsidiaries
from WCAS, which was the sole owner, for $289.2 million in cash paid at closing. SRS is a leading
U.S. provider in the service, maintenance and repair market with proprietary databases and workflow
solutions used by mechanical repair shops and auto dealers. Upon the closing of the SRS transaction,
we had control of SRS as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and
therefore consolidated its assets, liabilities, and financial results from the closing date. The acquisition
of SRS allows us to expand our reach deeper into household decisions related to the total cost of
automobile ownership. SRS has been included in our Americas segment. We have included the results
of operations of SRS in our consolidated statements of income (loss) from the acquisition date.
Revenues earned and net income reported by SRS were $74.0 million and $3.3 million, respectively,
for the period from the acquisition date through June 30, 2014.

We have the right to acquire the remaining 50% equity ownership interest of SRS (the “Call
Right”) at a price, subject to certain adjustments, equal to the greater of (a) a specified multiple of
WCAS’s cost basis of such equity ownership interest, and (b) a per share equity value based on a
specified multiple of SRS’s trailing twelve month EBITDA (the “TTM EBITDA”), as defined in the
stockholders agreement between us, WCAS and the other parties thereto (the “Stockholders
Agreement”). On July 16, 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity ownership interest in SRS from
WCAS (Note 17).

F-19


-----

In addition, under the Stockholders Agreement, we had the right to acquire 100% ownership
interest in two subsidiaries of SRS, AutoPoint, LLC and Mobile Productivity, LLC. (together,
“AutoPoint”), from SRS. We exercised our right and completed the acquisition of AutoPoint in April
2014. The acquisition resulted in tax deductible goodwill of $6.2 million.

WCAS has the right to require that we purchase its equity ownership interest in SRS up to four
times per year, subject to an annual cap of $250 million and a $25 million per exercise minimum (the
“Annual Put Right”) at a price based on the TTM EBITDA. In addition, WCAS has additional rights to
require that we purchase either half or all (depending on the triggering event) of their equity ownership
interest of SRS at a price, subject to certain adjustments, equal to a specified multiple of WCAS’s cost
basis of such equity ownership interest (the “Special Put Right”). The triggering events for the Special
Put Right include, among others, a drop in our corporate credit rating below certain specified levels or if
SRS is required to become a guarantor of any of the indebtedness of Solera or its subsidiaries (other
than SRS) or at any time beginning on August 1, 2018 and ending on the earlier of (x) December 31,
2018 and (y) the consummation of any Annual Put Right after August 1, 2018.

On the acquisition date, we determined the fair value of the 50% noncontrolling ownership
interest in SRS to be $289.2 million based primarily on our purchase price for 50% controlling
ownership interest. Because the SRS noncontrolling interest is redeemable at other than fair value, we
are accreting the carrying value to the redemption value at each reporting period through the earliest
redemption date. Accordingly, at any point in time, the carrying value of the SRS noncontrolling interest
represents the acquisition-date fair value, adjusted to reflect the noncontrolling owner’s share of net
income, dividends paid to the noncontrolling owner, and acquisition of additional equity ownership
interest in SRS by us, plus periodic accretion to the redemption value. Since the currently redeemable
portion of the SRS noncontrolling interest is capped at $250 million, which is less than the acquisitiondate fair value of the noncontrolling interest, we are accreting the carrying value to the redemption
value pursuant to the Special Put Right through August 1, 2018.

Additionally, if the redemption value of the SRS noncontrolling interest were to exceed the fair
value, the excess would result in an adjustment to the numerator in our calculation of net income per
common share attributable to Solera Holdings, Inc. which could result in a decrease in our net income
per share. The fair value of the SRS noncontrolling interest exceeded its redemption value at June 30,
2015.

We have accounted for the acquisition of SRS under the acquisition method of accounting and,
accordingly, the total purchase price has been allocated to the acquired tangible and identifiable
intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.
The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill. Of the
purchase price for SRS, we have preliminarily allocated $398.8 million to goodwill and $248.4 million to
identifiable intangible assets. The goodwill recorded in the acquisition represents future enhancements
to the software and database, future customer relationships and markets, and the workforce.

the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. We valued the purchased customer
relationships asset under the income approach using the excess earnings methodology based upon
estimated future discounted cash flows attributable to revenues projected to be generated from those
customers.

In connection with the acquisition of SRS, we incurred direct and incremental costs of $2.7
million, consisting of legal and professional fees, which are included in acquisition and related costs in
our consolidated statements of income (loss). Pursuant to the terms of our acquisition of SRS, we
received a $2.5 million cash payment from SRS at closing which was intended to reimburse us for a
portion of the direct and incremental costs we incurred related to the acquisition. This payment is also
included in acquisition and related costs in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2014.

We have not recognized any goodwill impairment losses to date.

**5. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests**

The noncontrolling stockholders of certain of our majority-owned subsidiaries have the right to
require us to redeem their shares at the then fair market value. Accordingly, we have presented these
redeemable noncontrolling interests as a mezzanine item in our consolidated balance sheets. If
redeemable at fair value, the redeemable noncontrolling interests are reported at their fair value with
any adjustment of the carrying value to fair value recorded to common shares in stockholders’ equity.
We estimate the fair value of our redeemable noncontrolling interests through an income approach,
utilizing a discounted cash flow model, and a market approach, which considers comparable
companies and transactions, including transactions with the noncontrolling stockholders of our
majority-owned subsidiaries.

We do not have any indication that the exercise of the redemption rights is probable within the
next twelve months. Further, we do not believe the occurrence of conditions precedent to the exercise
of certain of these redemption rights is probable within the next twelve months. If the stockholders
exercise their redemption rights, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund such redemptions.

customers and the sellers of acquired businesses, and facility lease deposits.
(2) Included in other current assets and other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet.

_Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash._ Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted
cash, primarily consist of bank deposits, money market funds and bank certificates of deposit. The fair
value of our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are determined using quoted market prices
for identical assets (Level 1 inputs).

_Derivative financial instruments._ We estimate the fair value of our cross-currency swaps using
standard valuation techniques that utilize market-based observable inputs to extrapolate future reset
rates from period-end yield curves and standard valuation models based on a discounted cash flow
model. Market-based observable inputs including spot and forward rates, volatilities and interest rate
curves at observable intervals are used as inputs to the models (Level 2 inputs). Our estimate of fair
value also considers the risk that the swap contracts will not be fulfilled.

F-26


-----

_Accrued contingent purchase consideration._ Contingent future cash payments related to
business combinations that are not deemed to be compensatory are accrued at fair value as of the
acquisition date. We re-assess the fair value measurement at each reporting date. Fair value is
determined by estimating the present value of potential future cash payments that would be earned
upon achievement by the acquired business of certain financial performance, product-related,
integration and other objectives. Our estimate of fair value considers a range of possible cash payment
scenarios using information available as of the reporting date, including the recent financial
performance of the acquired businesses (Level 3 inputs).

The following table summarizes the activity in accrued contingent purchase consideration which
is measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs) (in
thousands):

**Fiscal Year Ended June 30,**

_Redeemable_ _noncontrolling_ _interests._ We estimate the fair value of our redeemable
noncontrolling interests through an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow model, and a
market approach, which considers comparable companies and transactions, including transactions
with the noncontrolling stockholders of our majority-owned subsidiaries.

Under the income approach, the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the
present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to
future cash flows beyond the projection period. Both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk
inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows. A weighted
average cost of capital of a market participant, which is an unobservable input, is used as the discount
rate. The residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the
estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period. Alternatively, the present value of the
residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period.

Under the market approach, fair value is determined based on multiples of revenues and
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for each reporting unit. For our
calculation, we determined the multiples based on a selection of comparable companies and
acquisition transactions, discounted for each reporting unit to reflect the relative size, diversification
and risk of the reporting unit in comparison to the indexed companies and transactions.

Although we considered the fair value under both the income and market approaches, we
estimated the fair value of our redeemable noncontrolling interests based solely upon the income
approach, which utilizes a discounted cash flow model, a Level 3 input, as we believe this is the best
indicator of fair value. The significant unobservable inputs in the discounted cash flow model include a
discount rate and a long-term growth rate. The discount rate used in the determination of the estimated
fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests as of June 30, 2015 using the income approach
ranged between 12.8% and 16.5%, with a weighted average discount rate of 13.2%, reflecting a
market participant’s perspective as a noncontrolling shareholder in a privately-held subsidiary. The

long-term growth rate used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the redeemable
noncontrolling interests as of June 30, 2015 using the income approach was 4.0%.

**_Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis_**

We performed our fiscal year 2015 annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset
impairment assessment on April 1, 2015.

We test goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level. We determine the fair value of our
reporting units through a combination of an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow model,
and a market approach, which considers comparable companies and transactions.

Under the income approach, the discounted cash flow model determines the fair value of each
reporting unit based on the present value of projected reporting unit cash flows over a specific
projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period. Both
values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and
achieving the projected cash flows. A weighted average cost of capital of a market participant is used
as the discount rate. The residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth
rate to the estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period. Alternatively, the present value
of the residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection
period.

Under the market approach, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined based on multiples
of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for each reporting unit.
The multiples were determined based on a selection of comparable companies and acquisition
transactions, discounted for each reporting unit to reflect the relative size, diversification and risk of the
reporting unit in comparison to the indexed companies and transactions.

In our annual goodwill impairment assessment for fiscal year 2015, we concluded that the fair
values of the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned exceeded their respective carrying values
and, accordingly, we did not identify any goodwill impairment.

We determine fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets under an income approach using
the relief from royalty method, which assumes value to the extent that the acquired company is
relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the assets. In our annual
indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment for fiscal year 2015, we concluded that the fair
value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying value and,
accordingly, we did not identify any impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets.

**_Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments_**

The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. Based
on the current quoted trading price of our senior unsecured notes (Level 1 inputs), we believe that the
fair value of our senior unsecured notes is approximately $2.3 billion at June 30, 2015.

(1) Excludes the unamortized premium on the senior unsecured notes of $31.8 million as of June 30,
2015.

On June 2, 2015, we entered into a $200.0 million Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the “Credit
Agreement”) in connection with the completion of an acquisition. The Credit Agreement provides for an
unsecured term loan in the amount of $200.0 million (the “Term Loan”), which was fully funded on
June 2, 2015. The Term Loan matures no later than May 31, 2016 and bears interest based on the
London interbank offered rate for Eurodollar rate loans or the Prime Rate, at our election, plus an
applicable margin, with such applicable margin increasing by 0.50% per annum at the end of every 90
day period. The Term Loan currently bears interest at the London interbank offered rate for Eurodollar
rate loans plus a 3.5% margin (4.25% as of June 30, 2015). We may prepay all or part of the Term
Loan at any time without premium or penalty. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, we are
required to prepay the Term Loan with the net proceeds of certain incurrences of indebtedness, equity
issuances, asset sales and insurance/condemnation events. The Term Loan is guaranteed by Solera
and certain of our domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries. Since the Term Loan was repaid using the
proceeds from the issuance of additional senior unsecured notes in July 2015 (Note 17), the Term
Loan has been classified as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of
June 30, 2015.

We have issued senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “2021 Senior Notes”) pursuant to an
indenture dated as of July 2, 2013 and senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “2023 Senior Notes”)
pursuant to an indenture dated as of November 5, 2013. The 2021 Senior Notes accrue interest at
6.000% per annum, payable semi-annually, and become due and payable on June 15, 2021. The 2023
Senior Notes accrue interest at 6.125% per annum, payable semi-annually, and become due and
payable on November 1, 2023.

The 2021 Senior Notes include redemption provisions that allow us, at our option, to redeem all
or a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes as follows:

‰ At any time prior to June 15, 2016, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal
amount of the 2021 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 106.0% of the principal
amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of
redemption.

‰ At any time prior to June 15, 2017, we may redeem the 2021 Senior Notes, in whole or in part,
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a
premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The premium at the
applicable redemption date is the greater of: (1) 1.0% of the then outstanding principal amount
of the notes; or (2) the excess of: (a) the present value at such redemption date of the sum of
the

redemption price of the notes at June 15, 2017 plus all required interest payments due on the notes
through June 15, 2017 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date), computed using
a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate as of such redemption date plus 50 basis points; over
(b) the then outstanding principal amount of the notes.

‰ At any time on or after June 15, 2017, we may redeem the 2021 Senior Notes, in whole or in
part, at the following redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the
date of redemption: (i) if the redemption occurs on or after June 15, 2017 but prior to June 15,
2018, the redemption price is 103.000% of the principal amount of the notes; (ii) if the
redemption occurs on or after June 15, 2018 but prior to June 15, 2019, the redemption price is
101.500% of the principal amount of the notes; and (iii) if the redemption occurs on or after
June 15, 2019, the redemption price is 100.000% of the principal amount of the notes.

The 2023 Senior Notes include redemption provisions that allow us, at our option, to redeem all
or a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Senior Notes as follows:

‰ At any time prior to November 1, 2016, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal
amount of the 2023 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 106.125% of the principal
amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of
redemption.

‰ At any time prior to November 1, 2018, we may redeem the 2023 Senior Notes, in whole or in
part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a
premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The premium at the
applicable redemption date is the greater of: (1) 1.0% of the then outstanding principal amount
of the notes; or (2) the excess of: (a) the present value at such redemption date of the sum of
the redemption price of the notes at November 1, 2018 plus all required interest payments due
on the notes through November 1, 2018 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the
redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate as of such
redemption date plus 50 basis points over (b) the then outstanding principal amount of the
notes.

‰ At any time on or after November 1, 2018, we may redeem the 2023 Senior Notes, in whole or
in part, at the following redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the

date of redemption: (i) if the redemption occurs on or after November 1, 2018 but prior to
November 1, 2019, the redemption price is 103.063% of the principal amount of the notes; (ii) if
the redemption occurs on or after November 1, 2019 but prior to November 1, 2020, the
redemption price is 102.042% of the principal amount of the notes; (iii) if the redemption occurs
on or after November 1, 2020 but prior to November 1, 2021, the redemption price is 101.021%
of the principal amount of the notes; and (iv) if the redemption occurs on or after November 1,
2021, the redemption price is 100.000% of the principal amount of the notes.

Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we are required to offer to redeem the 2021 Senior
Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 101.021% of the principal amount of
the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the redemption date.

In November 2013, we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes and
the 2023 Senior Notes of $855.4 million, together with existing cash on hand, to redeem the
outstanding senior unsecured notes due June 2018 (the “2018 Senior Notes”). The redemption price
for the 2018 Senior Notes was $932.8 million, consisting of (i) the unpaid principal amount of $850.0
million, (ii) accrued unpaid interest through the redemption date of $24.4 million, and (iii) a redemption
premium of $58.4 million. The redemption premium of $58.4 million, as well as the remaining
unamortized debt issuance costs related to the 2018 Senior Notes, net of the unamortized premium, of
$1.8 million, were charged against earnings at the redemption date and are included in other (income)
expense, net in our consolidated statement of income (loss) for fiscal year 2014.

In July 2013, we used $289.5 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Senior
Notes to repay in full all of the outstanding term loans under our Amended and Restated First Lien
Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the “Amended Credit Facility”), including accrued unpaid interest
through the repayment date. Upon repayment of the outstanding term loans, the Amended Credit
Facility was terminated. In connection with the termination of the Amended Credit Facility, we wrote-off
the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the term loans of $3.1 million, which is
included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statement of income (loss) for fiscal year
2014.

The costs associated with the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes, the 2023 Senior Notes and the
Credit Agreement are deferred and are included in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance
sheet. We are amortizing these debt issuance costs to interest expense over the term of the related
debt using the effective interest method.

The indentures governing the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes contain limited
covenants, including those restricting our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain liens, engage in
sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge with, or convey, transfer or lease substantially
all of our or their assets to, another person, and, in the case of any of our subsidiaries that did not
issue or guarantee such notes, incur indebtedness. The Credit Agreement contains covenants
substantially similar to those in the indentures governing the 2021 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior
Notes. We are in compliance with the specified covenants of the 2021 Senior Notes, the 2023 Senior
Notes and the Credit Agreement at June 30, 2015.

**9. Derivative Financial Instruments**

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to variability in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates. We use derivatives to mitigate risks associated with this variability. We do
not use derivatives for speculative purposes. The following is a summary of outstanding derivative
financial instruments as of June 30, 2015:

‰ In April 2012, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency
swaps in the aggregate notional amount of €109.0 million. We pay Euro fixed coupon

payments at 6.990% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.750% on the notional
amount. The maturity date of the swaps is June 15, 2018. These cross-currency swaps were
designated, at inception, as cash flow hedges and we evaluate the swaps for effectiveness
quarterly. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these
gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. To date, there has
been no hedge ineffectiveness.

‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay floating / received fixed interest rate swap with a
notional amount of $400.0 million. Under the terms of the interest rate swap, we pay quarterly
floating coupon payments at 3-month LIBOR plus 3.924% and receive semi-annual fixed
coupon payments at 6.000%. The maturity date of the interest rate swap is June 15, 2021,
although the swap may be terminated at any time effective June 15, 2017 by the counterparty
subject to the payment of a cancellation fee. The interest rate swap was not designated as a
hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap in other
(income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income.

‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars crosscurrency swap with a notional amount of €401.6 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency
swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.993% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon
payments at 6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is
June 15, 2021. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We
recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net
in our consolidated statements of income.

‰ In March 2015, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency
swap with a notional amount of €174.8 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we
pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.725% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at
6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is June 15,
2021. The cross-currency swap was designated as a net investment hedge at inception. We
report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these gains or losses
into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. To date, there has been no hedge
ineffectiveness.

‰ In March 2015, we entered into a 60-day foreign exchange forward contract with a notional
amount of €472.9 million. Under the terms of the forward contract, we pay predetermined
forward rate on the settlement date. The foreign exchange forward contract was not designated
as a hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value in other (income) expense, net
in our consolidated statements of income. In May 2015, we extended the settlement date of the
foreign exchange forward contract to July 2015.

We determined the estimated fair value of our derivatives using an income approach and
standard valuation techniques that utilize market-based observable inputs including spot and forward
interest and foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities and interest rate curves at observable
intervals. Our estimate of fair value also considers the risk that the swap contracts will not be fulfilled.

No net investment hedges were outstanding prior to fiscal year 2015.

During fiscal years 2015 and 2014, we recognized unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives not
designated as hedging instruments of $(43.7) million and $6.7 million, respectively, which is included in
other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). No unrealized gains
(losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were recognized in fiscal year 2013.

**10. Share-Based Compensation**

We grant stock awards pursuant to our 2008 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the “2008 Plan”),
which was approved by our stockholders in November 2008. Upon stockholder approval of the 2008
Plan, we ceased granting awards under the 2007 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”)
and the remaining shares available for grant under the 2007 Plan were added to the shares authorized
for grant under the 2008 Plan. Additionally, any awards previously granted under the 2007 Plan that
expire unexercised or are forfeited are added to the shares authorized for grant under the 2008 Plan.

During fiscal year 2015, we granted stock awards under the 2008 Plan in the form of stock
options, restricted stock units and performance share units. Stock options are granted at exercise
prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, generally vest ratably
over four years and have a term of seven years. Restricted stock unit grants generally vest ratably over
four years. Each performance share unit represents the right to receive one share of our common
stock based on our total stockholder return (“TSR”) and/or the achievement of certain financial
performance targets during applicable performance periods.

At June 30, 2015, 2.9 million shares remain available for future grant of awards under the 2008
Plan.

We also have an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) that allows eligible employees to
purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 95% of the lower of the fair market value of
the common stock at the beginning or end of each six-month offering period. We have reserved for
issuance 1.5 million shares of our common stock under the ESPP. During fiscal years 2015 and 2014,
we awarded approximately 11,400 shares and 11,000 shares, respectively, of our common stock under
the ESPP. At June 30, 2015, approximately 1.4 million shares remain available for future grant of
awards under the ESPP.

Of the stock options outstanding at June 30, 2015, approximately 2.8 million are vested and
expected to vest.

Cash received from the exercise of stock options was $6.7 million during fiscal year 2015. The
intrinsic value of stock options exercised during fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013 totaled $1.8 million,
$8.1 million, and $5.7 million, respectively.

**_Valuation of Share-Based Awards_**

options with the following assumptions:

**Dividend**
**Yield**


**Weighted**
**Average**
**Expected**
**Stock Price**
**Volatility**

Fiscal Year 2015. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.6% 4.5 24.0% 1.5% $10.35
Fiscal Year 2014. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.6% 4.6 26.3% 1.2% $11.93
Fiscal Year 2013. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.7% 4.8 32.8% 1.0% $12.96

We based the risk-free interest rates on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury constant
maturities in effect at the time of the grant with remaining terms equivalent to the respective expected
terms of the stock options. We determine the expected life of an award by considering various relevant
factors, including the vesting period and contractual term of the award, our employees’ historical

exercise patterns and length of service, the expected future volatility of our stock price and employee
characteristics. We determined the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock
price. The dividend yields for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 are based on our quarterly cash
dividends of $0.195, $0.17 and $0.125 per share, respectively.

The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal years 2015,
2014 and 2013 was $52.36, $64.42 and $47.14, respectively, determined based on the market price of
our common stock on the date of grant, which approximates the intrinsic value.

To estimate the grant date fair value of performance share units and stock options that are
earned based on our relative TSR, we utilized a Monte-Carlo simulation model which simulates a
range of our possible future stock prices and certain peer companies and assumes that the
performance share units and stock options will be earned at target. Based on the Monte-Carlo
simulation model, the grant date fair value of performance share units and stock options granted during
fiscal year 2013 that are earned based on our relative TSR was $18.89 per share.

**_Share-Based Compensation Expense_**

Share-based compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income
(loss), was $36.9 million, $37.5 million and $25.8 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively. At June 30, 2015, the estimated total remaining unamortized share-based compensation
expense, net of forfeitures, was $49.1 million which is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 2.1 years.

**11. Employee Benefit Plans**

**_Defined Benefit Pension Plans_**

Our foreign subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension plans and individual defined
benefit arrangements covering certain eligible employees. The benefits under these pension plans are
based on years of service and compensation levels. Funding is limited to statutory requirements. The
measurement date for all plans is June 30[th] of each fiscal year.

Rate of compensation increase. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.16 2.15 2.14

We base the discount rate upon published rates for high quality fixed income investments that
produce cash flows that approximate the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments. We
determine the weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets based on historical and
expected future rates of return on plan assets considering the target asset mix and the long-term
investment strategy.

The plan assets of the pension plans consist entirely of insurance contracts, which fully insure the
benefit payments. The insurance companies invest the plan assets in accordance with the terms of the
insurance companies’ guidelines which include a guaranteed minimum rate of return. The fair values of
the insurance contracts and their input levels based on the fair value hierarchy are as follows (in
thousands):

We estimate the fair value of the insurance contracts based on vested plan benefits, which
considers the contributions made to date and the historical rate of return on the plan assets as
guaranteed by the insurance contracts.

The contributions for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $3.6 million,
$4.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. The minimum required contributions and expected
contributions to our pension plans are $3.9 million for fiscal year 2016.

_Defined Contribution Retirement and Savings Plans_

We have a qualifying 401(k) defined contribution plan that covers most of our domestic
employees and provides matching contributions under various formulas. For the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred $2.3 million, $1.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively, in
costs related to the 401(k) plan company matching contributions.

Our foreign subsidiaries have defined contribution plans that cover certain international
employees and provide matching contributions under various formulas. For the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred $4.5 million, $3.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively, in
costs related to our foreign defined contribution plans company matching contributions.

**12. Related Party Transactions**

On February 12, 2013, we entered into a Facilities Use Agreement with Aquila Family Ventures,
LLC (“AFV”), an entity owned by the family of our Chief Executive Officer, Tony Aquila, pursuant to
which we shall pay AFV a fixed annual fee of $140,000 in exchange for our use during calendar year
2013 of certain guest ranch facilities in Wyoming (the “Wyoming Facility”). On December 26, 2013, we
executed an amendment to the Facilities Use Agreement with AFV and Chaparral Lane Investment,
LLC (“CLI”), an entity owned by our Chief Executive Officer and his family, to (i) add an additional
facility in Roanoke, Texas (the “Roanoke Facility”) to the Facilities Use Agreement and (ii) increase the
fixed annual fee to$170,000 in exchange for our use during calendar year 2014 of the Wyoming
Facility. This fee increase is due to increased operating expenses of the Wyoming Facility and an
increase in the number of days during which we use the Wyoming Facility. On December 31, 2014, we
executed another amendment to the Facilities Use Agreement to: (i) increase the fixed annual fee paid
by us to AFV for our use of the Wyoming Facility to $272,250, and (ii) provide for a true-up payment by
us to AFV to the extent that our actual use of the Wyoming Facility during a calendar year exceeds the
assumed use for that calendar year, which assumed use was a basis for the fixed annual fee. The trueup payment paid by us to AFV for calendar year 2014 was $63,270. On April 7, 2015, we entered into
a third amendment to the Facilities Use Agreement whereby the Roanoke Facility and the CLI were
removed from the Facilities Use Agreement in connection with our entry of a lease agreement covering
the Roanoke Facility (also known as the “Innovation Center” (as defined below)).

On April 7, 2015 we entered into a Lease Agreement with CLI where we lease a property owned
by CLI in Texas (the “Innovation Center”). We have been using the Innovation Center since 2013
pursuant to the terms of the Facilities Use Agreement. We use the Innovation Center for various
purposes, including: research and development; global employee meetings, training and team building;
and functions intended to foster client, partner and vendor relations as well as business and corporate
development. The Lease Agreement provides us with continued, exclusive, long-term rights to use the
Innovation Center and protects our investment in the improvements to the Innovation Center. The
Lease Agreement has term of 20 years with an additional five-year extension option. The monthly
lease payment is $10,000.

**_Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances_**

As of June 30, 2015, we have $132.7 million of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards that
will begin to expire in 2033, $76.4 million of US State net operating loss carryforward that will begin to
expire in 2017, and $118.5 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards that will begin to expire in
2015. We also have $2.3 million of U.S. federal and $2.3 million of U.S. state research and
development tax credit carryforwards that will begin to expire in 2021, and $33.5 million of foreign tax
credit carryforwards that will begin to expire in 2016. Utilization of our U.S. federal and state net
operating losses and U.S. federal and state tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitation
due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state
provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss
carryforwards before utilization.

Of the $44.2 million deferred tax asset related to our federal net operating loss carryforwards,
$2.2 million is excluded from deferred income tax assets and liabilities as that amount relates to excess
tax benefits of stock based compensation deduction for which a tax benefit has not yet been realized,
as described below. In addition, $6.1 million related to the foreign tax credit carryforward, $0.6 million
related to the U.S. federal research and development tax credit carryforward, and $0.4 million related
to the U.S. state research and development tax credit carryforward are excluded from deferred income
tax assets and liabilities as those amounts also relate to excess tax benefits on stock-based
compensation deductions for which a tax benefit has not yet been realized.

We have not recorded excess tax benefits of $9.4 million as of June 30, 2015 from excess stockbased compensation deductions for which a benefit has not yet been realized. Excess tax benefits

F-42


-----

represent stock compensation deductions in excess of expenses recognized for financial reporting
purposes and are realized when they reduce taxes payable, as determined using a “with and without”
method.

We have recorded valuation allowances for deferred tax assets of $48.1 million and $40.7 million
at June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

**_Unremitted Earnings_**

Our foreign subsidiaries generate earnings that are not subject to U.S. income taxes so long as
they are permanently reinvested in our operations outside of the U.S. Pursuant to ASC Topic No. 74030 (formerly APB 23), undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently
reinvested would become subject to deferred income taxes under U.S. tax law. Prior to fiscal year
2015, we asserted that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were permanently
reinvested.

Primarily due to the increase in our U.S. debt service obligations resulting from the issuance of
additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million during fiscal year
2015 (Note 8) and the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount
of $850.0 million in July 2015 (Note 17), management concluded that the ability to access certain
amounts of foreign earnings would provide greater flexibility to meet domestic cash flow needs without
constraining foreign objectives. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we withdrew the
permanent reinvestment assertion on $350.0 million of earnings generated by certain of our foreign
subsidiaries through fiscal year 2015. We provided for U.S. income taxes on the $350.0 million of
undistributed foreign earnings, resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax liability of approximately
$123.7 million. We recognized additional deferred income tax expense of $25.8 million related to the
impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year 2015 on the portion of the
$350.0 million of unremitted earnings generated prior to fiscal year 2015.

There is no certainty as to the timing of when such foreign earnings will be distributed to the U.S.
in whole or in part. Further, when the foreign earnings are distributed to the U.S., we anticipate that a
substantial portion of the resulting U.S. income taxes due would be reduced by existing deferred tax
assets.

We have not provided for U.S. federal or foreign income taxes, including withholding taxes on
$732.0 million of our non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings as of June 30, 2015. We continue to
assert that the $732.0 million of undistributed earnings is permanently reinvested in our foreign
operations and have no current plans to repatriate those earnings. If we were to distribute those
earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we could be subject to both U.S. and foreign income
taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. It is currently not practicable to
compute the residual taxes due on such earnings as we do not know the time or manner in which we
would distribute these earnings.

**_Uncertain Tax Positions_**

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of total unrecognized tax benefits is as

Gross unrecognized tax benefits balance at end of period . . . . . . . . . . . . . $10,301 $13,235 12,500

Of the unrecognized tax benefits reflected above, the amounts that, if recognized, would impact
the effective tax rate were $11.6 million, $13.4 million and $12.7 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and
2013, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits expected to be recognized in the next
twelve months is not significant.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties, if incurred, related to unrecognized tax benefits as
a component of income tax expense. We had approximately $1.6 million, $1.2 million and $1.1 million
of accrued interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2015,
2014 and 2013, respectively.

We file U.S. federal income tax returns as well as income tax returns in various states and foreign
jurisdictions and, as such, are subject to examination in various jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions
that are subject to examination by tax authorities primarily include the United States, Canada, France,
Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, covering tax years 2005 through 2013.

Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreements, the sellers in our business combinations
have indemnified us for all tax liabilities related to the pre-acquisition periods. We are liable for any tax
assessments for the post-acquisition periods for our U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.

**14. Contractual Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Leases and Other Contractual Commitments_**

We lease office space and equipment under various operating and capital leases. Additionally,
we have contractual obligations under software license agreements and other purchase commitments.
Total expense incurred under these agreements was approximately $20.1 million, $18.0 million and
$14.0 million for the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Obligations under capital leases
totaled $0.2 million as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

In addition to fixed rentals, certain leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes
and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices.

**_Contingencies_**

In the normal course of business, we are subject to various claims, charges and litigation. In
particular, we have been the subject of allegations that our repair estimating and total loss software
and services produced results that favored our insurance company customers, one of which is the
subject of pending litigation. In addition, we are subject to assertions by our customers and strategic
partners that we have not complied with the terms of our agreements with them or our agreements with
them are not enforceable. We have and will continue to vigorously defend ourselves against these
claims. We believe that final judgments, if any, which may be rendered against us in current litigation,
are adequately reserved for, covered by insurance or would not have a material adverse effect on our
financial position.

**_Guarantees_**

In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts in which we makes representations and
warranties that guarantee the performance of our products and services. Losses related to such
guarantees were not significant during any of the periods presented.

**15. Segment and Geographic Information**

**_Segment Information_**

We have aggregated our operating segments into two reportable segments: EMEA and
Americas. Our EMEA reportable segment encompasses our operations in Europe, the Middle East,
Africa, Asia and Australia, while our Americas reportable segment encompasses our operations in
North, Central and South America.

Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. We evaluate the performance
of our reportable segments based on revenues, income before provision for income taxes and adjusted
EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP net income attributable to Solera
Holdings, Inc. excluding interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization,
stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, asset impairments and other costs
associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, litigation related expenses
and other (income) expense, net. We do not allocate certain costs to reportable segments, including
costs related to our financing activities, business development and oversight, and tax, audit and other
professional fees, to our reportable segments. Instead, we manage these costs at the Corporate level.

**_Concentration of Risks_**

We offer a broad range of services to a diverse group of customers throughout North, Central and
South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our
customers and monitor their financial condition and developing business news. No customers
accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenues or accounts receivable for any of the periods
presented.

**16. Share Repurchase Program**

In November 2014, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program, replacing
the share repurchase program authorized in October 2013, for up to a total of $375 million of our
common stock through December 31, 2016. Share repurchases are made from time to time, through
an accelerated stock purchase agreement, in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or
in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program does not require us to purchase any
specific number or amount of shares, and the timing and amount of such purchases will be determined
by management based upon market conditions and other factors. In addition, the program may be
amended or terminated at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Through June 30, 2015, we
repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for $78.8 million under the share repurchase program
that was authorized in November 2014. During fiscal year 2015, we repurchased approximately
2.1 million shares for $109.2 million under our share repurchase programs

**17. Subsequent Events**

On July 16, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the equity interests in SRS currently held by
WCAS for a purchase price of approximately $594.8 million, plus WCAS’ approximate share of SRS’s
cash balance of $25.0 million (the “SRS Equity Buyout”). The purchase price payable in the SRS
Equity Buyout was negotiated with WCAS and was not determined based on the existing call option or
put option formulas provided in the stockholders agreement governing the SRS joint venture. Upon
completion of the SRS Equity Buyout, we own 100% of the equity interests in SRS. We financed the
SRS Equity Buyout using a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of additional senior
unsecured notes (as described below).

On July 16, 2015, we issued additional 2023 Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$850.0 million. The 2023 Senior Notes were issued at an original issue price of 99.50% plus accrued
interest from May 1, 2015. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Senior Notes were used to
finance the SRS Equity Buyout and repay the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. We
intend to use any remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including continuing to
actively seek, evaluate and potentially pursue strategic initiatives. Such strategic initiatives may include
future acquisitions, joint ventures, investments or other business development opportunities.

On July 17, 2015, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency
swaps, each with a notional amount of €137.0 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swaps,
we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.135% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at
6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swaps is November 1, 2018.
One of the cross-currency swaps was designated as a net investment hedge at inception and one was
not designated as a hedge at inception. We also entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S.
dollars cross-currency swap with a notional amount of €274.0 million. Under the terms of the crosscurrency swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.585% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon
payments at 6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is
November 1, 2023. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. In addition,
we partially settled the foreign exchange forward contract and as a result incurred an $8.9 million
realized loss. Settlement of the remaining foreign exchange forward contract notional amount was
extended to July 2016.

On August 25, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors approved the payment of a cash
dividend of $0.225 per share of outstanding common stock and per outstanding restricted stock unit.
The dividends are payable on September 22, 2015 to stockholders and restricted stock unit holders of
record at the close of business on September 8, 2015. Any determination to pay dividends in future
periods will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.

(1) Our business is subject to seasonal and other fluctuations. In particular, we have historically
experienced higher revenues during the second quarter and third quarter versus the first quarter
and fourth quarter during each fiscal year. This seasonality is caused primarily by more days of
inclement weather during the second quarter and third quarter in most of our markets, which
contributes to a greater number of vehicle accidents and damage during these periods. In
addition, our business is subject to fluctuations caused by other factors, including the occurrence
of extraordinary weather events and the timing of certain public holidays. For example, the Easter
holiday occurs during the third quarter in certain fiscal years and occurs during the fourth quarter
in other fiscal years, resulting in a change in the number of business days during the quarter in
which the holiday occurs.
(2) The results of operations of DMEautomotive, LLC, CIMA Systems, Inc., Service Dynamics, Inc.,
IBS Automotive s.r.o., CAP Automotive, the Insurance and Services Division of Pittsburgh Glass
Works, LLC and the claims related business of the Sherwood Group of companies, acquired in
fiscal year 2015, are included from the respective dates of the acquisitions, which are not the first
day of fiscal year 2015.

(4) Net income (loss) attributable to Solera Holdings, Inc. and net income (loss) attributable to Solera
Holdings, Inc. per common share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 reflects deferred

subsidiaries through fiscal year 2015 (Note 13).

**SOLERA HOLDINGS, INC.**
**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**(Unaudited)**

**1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies**

**_Description of Business_**

Solera Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”, “Solera”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a leading
provider of risk and asset management software and services to the automotive and property
marketplace, including the global property and casualty (“P&C”) insurance industry. In addition to our
global-leading position in collision repair and our U.S. based mechanical repair presence, we provide
data driven productivity and decision support solutions to other aspects of vehicle ownership such as
vehicle validation, driver violation monitoring, vehicle salvage and electronic titling. We are also
expanding our core competencies of data, software and connectivity from the auto to the home. We
are active in over 75 countries across six continents.

Through our acquisition of the Insurance and Services Division of Pittsburgh Glass Works LLC
(“I&S”) in July 2014, we also provide software and business management tools, third-party claims
administration, first notice of loss and network management services to the U.S. auto and property
repair industries, specializing in glass claims. In addition, through our acquisition of CAP Automotive
(“CAP”) in November 2014, we provide valuation data and specification data for new and used vehicles
in the United Kingdom. In July 2015, we completed the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest
of Service Repair Solutions, Inc. (“SRS”) from Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe (“WCAS”). This
acquisition enables Solera to strengthen its service maintenance and repair (“SMR”) business and
expand our footprint in the global automotive industry.

**_Financial Statement Preparation_**

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”), and therefore, certain information and disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted. In the opinion of management, the accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods presented reflect all adjustments,
consisting of only normal, recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly state our financial position, results
of operations and cash flows. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015,
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 31, 2015. Our operating
results for the six month period ended December 31, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for any future periods.

**_Principles of Consolidation_**

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of
our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Our consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries
include certain of our subsidiaries located in Belgium, France, Portugal, Spain and Mexico. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

**_Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in
conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We

F-55


-----

base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we
believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are affected by estimates and
assumptions which are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for sales allowances, allowance for
doubtful accounts, fair value of derivatives, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, amortization of
intangibles, restructurings, liabilities under defined benefit plans, stock-based compensation,
redeemable noncontrolling interests and income taxes.

**_New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted_**

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU Topic No. 201409, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements
in ASC Topic No. 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. This guidance
primarily requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015—14,
_Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the effective date, which deferred the_
effective date of ASU Topic No. 2014-09 for one year. As a result, ASU Topic No. 2014-09 will be
effective for our fiscal year 2019. ASU Topic No. 2014-09 permits the use of either the retrospective or
cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently
evaluating the effect that ASU Topic No. 2014-09 will have on our financial condition, results of
operations and financial statement disclosures.

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an
_Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to perform interim and_
annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of
issuance of the entity’s financial statements. ASU Topic No. 2014-15 is effective for our fiscal year
2017. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial
statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015-3, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic
_835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs_
related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU Topic No. 2015-3 is effective
for our fiscal year 2017. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU Topic No. 2015-03 for
debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU
Topic No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated
_With Line-of-Credit Arrangements—Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement_
_at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting, which clarified the presentation and measurement requirements of_
debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit arrangements. ASU Topic No. 2015-15
allows an entity to either defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize
the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of
whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement, or present them as a
direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt as provided by ASU Topic No. 2015-3.ASU Topic
No. 2015-15 is effective for our fiscal year 2017. The adoption of these standards will result in
reclassification of debt issuance costs from assets to liabilities.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015- 5, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal_Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing_
_Arrangement, which provides guidance to help entities determine whether a cloud computing_
arrangement includes a software license and evaluate fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing
arrangement. ASU Topic No. 2015-5 is effective for our fiscal year 2017. We do not expect the
adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements.

F-56


-----

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015—16, Business Combinations (Topic
_805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which allows an entity to_
recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that in a business combination in the reporting period in
which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU Topic No. 2015-16 is effective for our fiscal year
2017. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial
statements.

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2015—17, Income Taxes (Topic 740):
_Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be_
classified as noncurrent assets or noncurrent liabilities. ASU Topic No. 2015-16 is effective for our
fiscal year 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our
financial statements.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU Topic No. 2016—1, Financial Statements—Overall
_(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which_
requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in
income; use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure
purposes; separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category
and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial
statements; present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the
fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk; and eliminates the
requirement disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is
required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet.
ASU Topic No. 2016-1 is effective for our fiscal year 2019. We do not expect the adoption of this
standard to have a material impact on our financial statements.

**2. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Solera Holdings, Inc. Per Common Share**

All of our restricted stock units and performance share units have the right to receive nonforfeitable dividends on an equal basis with common stock and therefore are considered participating
securities that must be included in the calculation of net income (loss) per share using the two-class
method. Under the two-class method, basic and diluted net income (loss) per share is determined by
calculating net income (loss) per share for common stock and participating securities based on the
cash dividends paid and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Diluted net income per share
also considers the dilutive effect of in-the-money stock options and unvested restricted stock units and
performance share units that have the right to receive forfeitable dividends, calculated using the
treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount of assumed proceeds from
unexercised stock options and unvested restricted stock units and performance share units that have
the right to forfeitable dividends includes the amount of compensation cost attributable to future
services not yet recognized, proceeds from the exercise of the options, and any excess income tax
benefit or liability. For the six months ended December 31, 2015, we reported a net loss attributable to
common shares and, as a result, all potentially dilutive common share equivalents have been excluded
from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as they would be antidilutive.

common share using the two-class method is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

**3. Business Combinations**

**_Six months ended December 31, 2015_**

We originally acquired a 50% equity ownership interest in SRS from WCAS in November 2013.
Since the November 2013 acquisition date, we had control of SRS as defined by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and therefore consolidated its assets, liabilities, and financial
results from the closing date.

On July 16, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity ownership interest in
SRS held by WCAS for a purchase price of approximately $594.8 million, plus WCAS’ approximate
share of SRS’s cash balance of $25.0 million (the “SRS Equity Buyout”). The purchase price payable in

-----

the SRS Equity Buyout was negotiated with WCAS and was not determined based on the existing call
option or put option formulas provided in the stockholders agreement. We financed the SRS Equity
Buyout using a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of additional senior unsecured notes in
July 2015 (Note 9).

During the six months ended December 31, 2015, in addition to the SRS Equity Buyout, we
acquired one business for approximately $4.6 million in cash paid at closing and additional future cash
payments of $5.5 million contingent upon the achievement of certain financial performance and
objectives. This acquisition is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. The purchase price
allocation for this acquisition reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as
of December 31, 2015 is preliminary.

**_Six months ended December 31, 2014_**

On November 19, 2014, we acquired 100% of the equity interests of CAP, for approximately
£284.8 million ($449.7 million) in cash paid at closing.

On July 29, 2014, we acquired 100% of the operating entities and other assets comprising I&S,
for approximately $279.4 million in cash paid at closing.

During the six months ended December 31, 2014, in addition to CAP and I&S, we acquired two
businesses for approximately $27.5 million in cash paid at closing and additional future cash payments
of up to $14.2 million contingent upon the achievement of certain financial performance, productrelated, integration and other objectives. The acquisitions completed during the six months ended
December 31, 2014 were immaterial to our financial statements, both individually and in the aggregate.

At December 31, 2015, the maximum aggregate amount of remaining contingent cash payments
associated with our business combinations is $68.9 million payable through fiscal year 2019.

(1) Please refer to Note 6 for further information on repurchases of our common stock. In accordance with ASC
Topic No. 505-30-30, we have allocated the cost of the shares repurchased between paid-in capital and
retained earnings based on the excess of the repurchase price over the stated value.

**6. Share Repurchase Program**

In November 2014, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program, replacing the share
repurchase program authorized in October 2013, for up to a total of $375 million of our common stock through
December 31, 2016. Share repurchases are made from time to time, through an accelerated stock purchase
agreement, in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. The
repurchase program does not require us to purchase any specific number or amount of shares, and the timing
and amount of such purchases will be determined by management based upon market conditions and other
factors. In addition, the program may be amended or terminated at the discretion of our Board of Directors.
Through December 31, 2015, we have repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for $78.8 million under the
share repurchase program, approved by our Board of Directors in November 2014. No shares were repurchased
during the six months ended December 31, 2015.

balance sheets. Restricted cash primarily relates to funds held in escrow for the benefit of
customers and the sellers of acquired businesses, and facility lease deposits.
(2) Included in other current assets and other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet.
(3) Included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other noncurrent liabilities in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

_Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash._ Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted
cash, primarily consist of bank deposits, money market funds and bank certificates of deposit. The fair
value of our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are determined using quoted market prices
for identical assets (Level 1 inputs).

_Derivative financial instruments._ We estimate the fair value of our derivative financial
instruments using industry standard valuation techniques that utilize market-based observable inputs to
extrapolate future reset rates from period-end yield curves and standard valuation models based on a
discounted cash flow model. Market-based observable inputs including spot and forward rates,
volatilities and interest rate curves at observable intervals are used as inputs to the models (Level 2
inputs). Our estimate of fair value also considers the credit related risk that the swap contracts will not
be fulfilled.

_Accrued contingent purchase consideration._ Contingent future cash payments related to
business combinations that are not deemed to be compensatory are accrued at fair value as of the
acquisition date. We re-assess the fair value measurement at each reporting date. Fair value is
determined by estimating the present value of potential future cash payments that would be earned
upon achievement by the acquired business of certain financial performance, product-related,
integration and other objectives. Our estimate of fair value considers a range of possible cash payment
scenarios using information available as of the reporting date, including the recent financial
performance of the acquired businesses (Level 3 inputs).

The following table summarizes the activity in accrued contingent purchase consideration which
is measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs) (in
thousands):

_Redeemable_ _noncontrolling_ _interests._ We estimate the fair value of our redeemable
noncontrolling interests through an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow model. We also
consider the fair value using a market approach, which considers comparable companies and
transactions, including transactions with the noncontrolling stockholders of our majority-owned
subsidiaries.

F-63


-----

Under the income approach, the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the
present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to
future cash flows beyond the projection period. Both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk
inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows. A weighted
average cost of capital of a market participant, which is an unobservable input, is used as the discount
rate. The residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the
estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period. Alternatively, the present value of the
residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period.

Under the market approach, fair value is determined based on multiples of revenues and
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for each reporting unit. For our
calculation, we determined the multiples based on a selection of comparable companies and
acquisition transactions, discounted for each reporting unit to reflect the relative size, diversification
and risk of the reporting unit in comparison to the indexed companies and transactions.

Although we considered the fair value under both the income and market approaches, we
estimated the fair value of our redeemable noncontrolling interests based solely upon the income
approach, which utilizes a discounted cash flow model, a Level 3 input, as we believe this is the better
indicator of fair value. The significant unobservable inputs in the discounted cash flow model include a
discount rate and a long-term growth rate. The discount rate used in the determination of the estimated
fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2015 using the income
approach ranged between 12.8% and 16.4%, with a weighted average discount rate of 13.2%,
reflecting a market participant’s perspective as a noncontrolling shareholder in a privately-held
subsidiary. The long-term growth rate used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the
redeemable noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2015 using the income approach was 4.0%.

The following table summarizes the activity in redeemable noncontrolling interests which are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis solely using the income approach and using significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs) (in thousands):

**_Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis_**

No assets or liabilities were required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during
the six months ended December 31, 2015.

**_Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments_**

The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. Based
on the current quoted trading price of our senior unsecured notes (Level 1 inputs), we believe that the
fair value of our senior unsecured notes is approximately $3.1 billion at December 31, 2015.

(1) The balance as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015 includes unamortized net premium of
$25.4 million and $31.8 million, respectively.

We have issued senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “2021 Senior Notes”) pursuant to an
indenture dated as of July 2, 2013 and senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “2023 Senior Notes”)
pursuant to an indenture dated as of November 5, 2013. The 2021 Senior Notes accrue interest at
6.000% per annum, payable semi-annually, and become due and payable on June 15, 2021. The 2023
Senior Notes accrue interest at 6.125% per annum, payable semi-annually, and become due and
payable on November 1, 2023.

On July 16, 2015, we issued additional 2023 Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$850.0 million. The additional 2023 Senior Notes were issued at an original issue price of 99.500%
plus accrued interest from May 1, 2015. The net proceeds from the issuance of the additional 2023
Senior Notes of $842.5 million were used to finance the SRS Equity Buyout and repay the $200.0
million unsecured term loan due May 2016. As a result of the repayment of the unsecured term loan,
unamortized debt issuance costs of $1.1 million were written off during the six months ended
December 31, 2015 and are presented in other (income) expense, net in the accompanying
consolidated statement of income (loss). We intend to use any remaining net proceeds from the
issuance of the 2023 Senior Notes for general corporate purposes, including continuing to actively
seek, evaluate and potentially pursue strategic initiatives. Such strategic initiatives may include future
acquisitions, joint ventures, investments or other business development opportunities.

The 2021 Senior Notes include redemption provisions that allow us, at our option, to redeem all
or a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes as follows:

‰ At any time prior to June 15, 2016, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal
amount of the 2021 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 106.000% of the principal
amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of
redemption.

‰ At any time prior to June 15, 2017, we may redeem the 2021 Senior Notes, in whole or in part,
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a
premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The premium at the
applicable redemption date is the greater of: (1) 1.0% of the then outstanding principal amount
of the notes; or (2) the excess of: (a) the present value at such redemption date of the sum of
the redemption price of the notes at June 15, 2017 plus all required interest payments due on
the notes through June 15, 2017 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption
date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate as of such redemption date
plus 50 basis points; over (b) the then outstanding principal amount of the notes.

June 15, 2019, the redemption price is 100% of the principal amount of the notes.

The 2023 Senior Notes include redemption provisions that allow us, at our option, to redeem all
or a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Senior Notes as follows:

‰ At any time prior to November 1, 2016, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal
amount of the 2023 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 106.125% of the principal
amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of
redemption.

‰ At any time prior to November 1, 2018, we may redeem the 2023 Senior Notes, in whole or in
part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a
premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The premium at the
applicable redemption date is the greater of: (1) 1.0% of the then outstanding principal amount
of the notes; or (2) the excess of: (a) the present value at such redemption date of the sum of
the redemption price of the notes at November 1, 2018 plus all required interest payments due
on the notes through November 1, 2018 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the
redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate as of such
redemption date plus 50 basis points over (b) the then outstanding principal amount of the
notes.

‰ At any time on or after November 1, 2018, we may redeem the 2023 Senior Notes, in whole or
in part, at the following redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the

In connection with the pending merger with entities affiliated with Vista Equity Partners, the
Company has commenced cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding 2021 Senior Notes and
the 2023 Senior Notes (Note 16).

The costs associated with the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes are
deferred and are included in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. We are
amortizing these debt issuance costs to interest expense over the term of the related debt using the
effective interest method.

The indentures governing the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes contain limited
covenants, including those restricting our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain liens, engage in
sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge with, or convey, transfer or lease substantially
all of our or their assets to, another person, and, in the case of any of our subsidiaries that did not
issue or guarantee such notes, incur indebtedness. We are in compliance with the specified covenants
of the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes at December 31, 2015.

**10. Derivative Financial Instruments**

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to variability in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates. We use derivatives to mitigate risks associated with this variability. We do
not use derivatives for speculative purposes. The following is a summary of outstanding derivative
financial instruments as of December 31, 2015:

‰ In April 2012, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency
swaps in the aggregate notional amount of €109.0 million. We pay Euro fixed coupon
payments at 6.990% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.750% on the notional
amount. The maturity date of the swaps is June 15, 2018. These cross-currency swaps were
designated, at inception, as cash flow hedges and we evaluate the swaps for effectiveness
quarterly. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these
gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. To date, there has
been no hedge ineffectiveness.

‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay floating / received fixed interest rate swap with a
notional amount of $400.0 million. Under the terms of the interest rate swap, we pay quarterly
floating coupon payments at 3-month LIBOR plus 3.924% and receive semi-annual fixed
coupon payments at 6.000%. The maturity date of the interest rate swap is June 15, 2021,
although the swap may be terminated at any time effective June 15, 2017 by the counterparty
subject to the payment of a cancellation fee. The interest rate swap was not designated as a
hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap in other
(income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

‰ In November 2014, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars crosscurrency swap with a notional amount of €401.6 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency
swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.993% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon
payments at 6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is
June 15, 2021. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We
recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net
in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

‰ In March 2015, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency
swap with a notional amount of €174.8 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we
pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.725% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at
6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is June 15,
2021. The cross-currency swap was designated as a net investment hedge at inception. We
report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and reclassify these gains or losses
into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. In October 2015, we dedesignated the cross-currency swap as a net investment hedge. Upon de-designation, we
recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net
in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

‰ In March 2015, we entered into a foreign exchange forward contract with a notional amount of
€472.9 million. Under the terms of the forward contract, we pay predetermined forward rate on
the settlement date. The foreign exchange forward contract was not designated as a hedge at
inception. We recognize changes in the fair value in other (income) expense, net in our
consolidated statements of income (loss). In July 2015, we partially settled the foreign
exchange forward contract for a cash payment of $8.9 million which is reported in other
(income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Settlement of the
remaining foreign exchange forward contract with a notional amount of €235.8 million was
extended to July 2016.

‰ In July 2015, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency
swaps, each with a notional amount of €137.0 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency
swaps, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.135% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon
payments at 6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swaps is
November 1, 2018. One of the cross-currency swaps was designated as a net investment
hedge at inception and one was not designated as a hedge at inception. We report the effective
portion of the gain or loss on the cross-currency swap designated as a net investment hedge
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and
reclassify these gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. In
October 2015, we de-designated the cross-currency swap as a net investment hedge. Upon
the de-designation, we recognize changes in the fair value of both swaps in other (income)
expense, net in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

‰ In July 2015, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swap
with a notional amount of €274.0 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we pay
Euro fixed coupon payments at 5.585% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at
6.125% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is November 1,
2023. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize
changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swaps in other (income) expense, net in our
consolidated statements of income (loss).

We determined the estimated fair value of our derivatives using an income approach and
standard valuation techniques that utilize market-based observable inputs including spot and forward
interest and foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities and interest rate curves at observable
intervals. Our estimate of fair value also considers the risk that the swap contracts will not be fulfilled.

**_Valuation of Share-Based Awards_**

No stock options were granted during the six months ended December 31, 2015. For stock
options granted during the six months ended December 31, 2014, we utilized the Black-Scholes option
pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock options with the following assumptions:


**Expected**
**Dividend Yield**


**Weighted**
**Average**
**Expected**
**Stock Price**
**Volatility**


**Risk-Free**
**Interest Rate**


**Expected**
**Term (in**
**years)**


**Weighted**
**Average Per**
**Share Grant**
**Date Fair**
**Value**


Six Months Ended December 31,
2014. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.7% 4.5 24% 1.4% $11.20

We based the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury constant
maturities in effect at the time of the grant with remaining terms equivalent to the respective expected
terms of the options. We determined the expected life of an award by considering various relevant
factors, including the vesting period and contractual term of the award, our employees’ historical
exercise patterns and length of service, the expected future volatility of our stock price and employee
characteristics. We determined the expected volatility based on our historical stock price volatility over
the expected term. The dividend yield is based on our quarterly dividend of $0.195 per share declared
during the six months ended December 31, 2014.

No restricted stock units or performance share units were granted during the six months ended
December 31, 2015. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units and
performance share units granted during the six months ended December 31, 2014 was $56.40,
determined based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, which approximates
the intrinsic value.

**_Share-Based Compensation Expense_**

Share-based compensation expense was $14.2 million and $14.3 million for the six months
ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and is reported in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss). At
December 31, 2015, the estimated total remaining unamortized share-based compensation expense,
net of forfeitures, was $29.2 million, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of
1.8 years.

**12. Defined Benefit Pension Plans**

Our foreign subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension plans and individual defined
benefit arrangements covering certain eligible employees. We base the benefits under these pension
plans on years of service and compensation levels. Funding is limited to statutory requirements.

The components of net pension expense were as follows (in thousands):

**14. Provision For Income Taxes**

Our tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate
of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the
relevant period. Our quarterly tax provision is subject to significant variation due to several factors,
including variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to
which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, foreign currency gains (losses),
changes in law, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized.
Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income
or loss.

We recorded an income tax provision (benefit) of $(21.9) million and $9.3 million for the six
months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the six months ended December 31,
2015, the expected tax provision derived from applying the U.S. federal statutory rate to our pre-tax
income differed from our recorded income tax provision primarily due to the amount of our pre-tax loss,
relative to our income tax expense, nondeductible expenses, and changes in tax law.

Gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015 were $10.6 million
and $10.3 million, respectively. No significant interest and penalties have been accrued during the six
months ended December 31, 2015.

Pursuant to the terms of the respective acquisition agreements, the sellers in our business
combinations have indemnified us for all tax liabilities related to the pre-acquisition periods. We are
liable for any tax assessments for the post-acquisition periods for our U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.

As of each reporting date, management considers all evidence, both positive and negative, that
could impact our view with regards to future realization of deferred tax assets including our U.S.
cumulative income or loss position over the 12 quarters ended December 31, 2015 which included
recent increases to interest expense. As of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015, we continue to
maintain a valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets of $26.9 million due to the limitation in
our ability to utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
The U.S. cumulative loss position reduced the weight given to subjective evidence such as projections
for future growth. We believe that our estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently

F-72


-----

uncertain, and if our current or future operations and investments generate taxable income different
than the anticipated amounts or US tax law changes reduce income expected in the future,
adjustments to the valuation allowance are possible.

Primarily due to the increase in our U.S. debt service obligations resulting from the issuance of
additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million during fiscal year
2015 and the issuance of additional unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$850.0 million in July 2015, management concluded that the ability to access certain amounts of
foreign earnings would provide greater flexibility to meet domestic cash flow needs without constraining
foreign objectives. Accordingly, in fiscal year 2015 we withdrew the permanent reinvestment assertion
on $350.0 million of earnings generated by certain of our foreign subsidiaries through fiscal year 2015.
We provided for U.S. income taxes on the $350.0 million of undistributed foreign earnings, resulting in
the recognition of a deferred tax liability of approximately $123.7 million. During the six months ended
December 31, 2015, we recognized a deferred income tax expense of $2.9 million related to the impact
of fluctuations in foreign currency exchanges rates on the portion of the $350.0 million of unremitted
earnings generated prior to fiscal year 2015.

**15. Segment and Geographic Information**

We have aggregated our operating segments into two reportable segments: EMEA and
Americas. Our EMEA reportable segment encompasses our operations in Europe, the Middle East,
Africa, Asia and Australia. Our Americas reportable segment encompasses our operations in North,
Central and South America.

Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. We evaluate the performance of
our reportable segments based on revenues, income before provision for income taxes and adjusted
EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. We calculate adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable
to Solera Holdings, Inc. excluding interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, share-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, asset impairments and other
costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, litigation related expenses
and other (income) expense, net. We do not allocate certain costs, managed at the corporate level, to
reportable segments, including costs related to our financing activities, business development and
oversight, and tax, audit and other professional fees, to our reportable segments.

**16. Pending Acquisition by Affiliates of Vista Equity Partners**

On September 13, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
“Merger Agreement”) with Summertime Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and
Summertime Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving
the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent and Merger Sub were formed by
affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Fund V, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Sponsor” or
“Vista”). The board of directors of the Company (the “Board”), following the receipt of the unanimous
recommendation of a special committee of independent directors of the Board, unanimously approved
the Merger Agreement. On December 8, 2015, our stockholders voted to adopt the Merger Agreement.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Common Stock”) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than (i) shares owned by stockholders who
have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights, (ii) shares owned by Parent, Merger
Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and (iii) shares owned by the
Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, in each of cases (ii) and
(iii) not held on behalf of third parties), will be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in
an amount equal to $55.85, without interest thereon.

Consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified closing
conditions, including (i) the approval of the Merger by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of the Common Stock entitled to vote at a stockholders meeting (which was
approved on December 8, 2015), (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (which termination occurred on October 9,
2015) and the receipt of certain other non-United States regulatory approvals required to consummate
the Merger (which we have received effective as of December 31, 2015), and (iii) other customary
closing conditions, including (a) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (b) the accuracy of each party’s representations
and warranties (subject to customary materiality qualifiers) and (c) each party’s performance of its
obligations and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains
representations, warranties and covenants of the parties customary for a transaction of this type,
including, among other things, covenants not to solicit alternative transactions or to provide information
or enter into discussions in connection with alternative transactions, subject to certain exceptions to
allow the Board to exercise its fiduciary duties.

The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Parent,
including, among others, if the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are not
consummated on or before March 15, 2016 or if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement in
compliance with its terms in order to accept a superior proposal. Upon termination of the Merger
Agreement under specified circumstances, the Company has agreed to pay Parent a termination fee of

F-74


-----

$114.4 million and/or reimburse Parent’s expenses up to $5.0 million (which reimbursement shall
reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis, any termination fee subsequently payable by the Company). Upon
termination of the Merger Agreement under certain other specified circumstances, Parent will be
required to pay the Company a termination fee equal to $228.75 million. The Sponsor has provided the
Company with a limited guarantee in favor of the Company guaranteeing the payment of Parent’s
termination fee if such amount becomes payable under the Merger Agreement.

Parent has obtained common equity, preferred equity and debt financing commitments for the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the aggregate proceeds of which will be
sufficient for Parent to pay the aggregate merger consideration and all related fees and expenses.
Financing will consist of common equity committed by Parent and common equity, preferred equity and
debt committed by third party financing sources.

In connection with the pending Merger, the Company commenced cash tender offers for the 2021
Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes (collectively, the “Notes”). Noteholders that validly tender their
Notes by January 28, 2016 (the “Early Tender Date”) will receive an amount equal to $1,012.50 per
$1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes, which includes an early participation premium of $50.00 per
$1,000.00 in principal amount. Noteholders that validly tender their Notes by January 29, 2016 (the
“Expiration Date”) will receive an amount equal to $962.50 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes.
Consummation of the tender offer and payment for the Notes validly tendered pursuant to the tender
offer are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, but not limited to, the receipt of
requisite consents, the consummation of the Merger and financing conditions.

Concurrently with the commencement of the tender offer, the Company commenced the requisite
change of control redemption offer for the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101.000% of the
principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the
redemption date (“Change of Control Offer”).

As of January 6, 2016, the Company has received tenders and consents from holders of $1,680.7
million in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes, representing approximately 99.7% of
the total outstanding principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes, and tenders and consents from
holders of $1,413.8 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes, representing
approximately 99.9% of the total outstanding principal amount of the 2023 Notes.

The Company has received the requisite consents in respect of the Notes to amend the
respective indentures governing the Notes. As a result, the Company and the Trustee executed
supplemental indentures relating to each of the 2021 Notes and the 2023 Notes on November 20,
2015 (“Supplemental Indentures”). Upon the effectiveness of the Supplemental Indentures, the
Company will no longer have an obligation to make the Change of Control Offer. As a result, the
Company terminated the Change of Control Offer.

On September 21, 2015, an alleged stockholder of the Company filed an action in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware on behalf of a putative class of the Company’s stockholders against
the Company and its directors, Vista, Parent and Merger Sub. The complaint alleges, among other
things, that the Company’s directors breached their fiduciary duties by approving the Merger
Agreement at an inadequate price and following an inadequate sale process, and that the Company,
Vista, Parent and Merger Sub aided and abetted these alleged breaches of duty. The complainant
seeks, among other things, either to enjoin the proposed transaction or to rescind it should it be
consummated, as well as an award of plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and costs in the action. On October 13,
2015, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. On October 21, 2015,
the plaintiff filed an amended complaint that added allegations contending that the Company’s
disclosure contained in the preliminary version the Company’s proxy statement misstated or failed to

disclose certain allegedly material information to Company stockholders. On October 22, 2015, the
plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the holding of the Company’s
shareholder meeting based upon his claim that the Company’s public disclosures were inadequate. On
November 5, 2015, the Court denied the motion for expedited proceedings, and declined to consider
plaintiff’s motion seeking to enjoin the special meeting. The defendants deny any wrongdoing in
connection with the merger and plan to defend vigorously against the claims set forth in the amended
complaint and any injunction motion.

On November 17, 2015, a duplicative action was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware against our directors on behalf of the same putative class of the Company’s stockholders,
alleging similar claims for breach of fiduciary duty and challenging the merger and the disclosures
relating to the merger. On December 23, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action.
That motion remains pending. The defendants deny any wrongdoing in connection with the merger and
plan to defend vigorously against the claims set forth in these actions.

Other than expenses associated with the proposed Merger, which are reported in acquisition and
related costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss), the Merger did not impact
our reported financial results as of and for the six months ended December 31, 2015.

**17. Subsequent Events**

On January 28, 2016, we announced that the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors
approved the payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.225 per share of outstanding common stock and
per outstanding restricted stock unit. The dividends are payable on the earlier of the closing date of the
Merger or March 1, 2016 to stockholders and restricted stock unit holders of record at the close of
business on February 11, 2016.
