**Notice to Investors in the United States**

This Offering is being made in the United States in reliance upon an exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities
Act for an offer and sale of the Notes which does not involve a public offering. In making your purchase, you will be
deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and agreements. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

This offering memorandum is being provided (1) to a limited number of U.S. investors that we reasonably believe to be
QIBs for informational use solely in connection with their consideration of the purchase of the Notes and (2) to non-U.S.
persons outside the United States pursuant to offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S.
Securities Act. The Notes described in this offering memorandum have not been registered with, recommended by or
approved by the SEC, any state securities commission in the United States or any other securities commission or regulatory
authority, nor has the SEC, any state securities commission in the United States or any such securities commission or
authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this offering memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offense in the United States.

**Notice to Investors in the EEA**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means
a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the “Insurance Distribution
**Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID**
II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently,
no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful
under the PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any
member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the
Prospectus Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Notes will be made pursuant to an
exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the Notes. In relation
to each Relevant State of the EEA (a “Relevant State”), no offer of Notes to the public in that Relevant State may be made
other than at any time to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation; provided
that no such offer of Notes shall require us or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 1 of the
Prospectus Regulation, or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation. Accordingly, any


-----

person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which
no obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial
Purchasers have authorized, nor do authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary, other
than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering
Memorandum.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer to the public” shall have the meaning ascribed in the Prospectus
Regulation.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a Relevant State will be deemed to have
represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a “qualified investor” within the meaning of Article 2(e) of the Prospectus
Regulation. The Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates, and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the
foregoing representation, acknowledgement and agreement. Notwithstanding the above, a person who is not a qualified
investor and who has notified the Initial Purchasers of such fact in writing may, with the consent of the Initial Purchasers,
be permitted to subscribe for or purchase the Notes in the Offering.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
Notes as defined in the offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes
to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the
Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**Notice to Investors in France**

This offering memorandum has not been prepared in the context of an offer to the public of financial securities within the
meaning of the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, the Notes may not be, directly or indirectly, offered or sold to the
public in France (offre au public de titres financiers), and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material
may be distributed to the public in France. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Notes may be offered and sold in France
exclusively to a limited number of investors acting for their own account (cercle restreint d’investisseurs agissant pour
_compte propre) in accordance with Article L.411-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et_
_financier) or to qualified investors (investisseurs qualifiés) as defined by Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation._
Prospective investors are informed that: (i) this offering memorandum has not been and will not be submitted for clearance
to the Autorité des marchés financiers (the “AMF”); and (ii) the direct and indirect distribution or sale to the public of the
Notes acquired by them may only be made in compliance with Articles L.411-1 and L.411-2 of the French Monetary and
Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier) and applicable regulation thereunder. Investors in France and persons into
whose possession offering materials come must inform themselves about, and observe, any such restrictions.

**Notice to Investors in Switzerland**

The Notes may not be publicly offered, advertised, distributed or sold in Switzerland and will not be listed on the SIX
Swiss Exchange or on any other stock exchange or regulated multilateral trading facility in Switzerland. This document
does not constitute an offering prospectus and has been prepared without regard to the disclosure standards for issuance
prospectuses under art. 652a or art. 1156 of the Swiss Code of Obligations, art. 35 et seq. of the Swiss Financial Services
Act (the “FinSA”) or the disclosure standards for listing prospectuses under art. 27 et seq. of the SIX Listing Rules or the
listing rules of any other stock exchange or regulated multilateral trading facility in Switzerland. Neither this document nor
any other offering or marketing material relating to the Notes or the offering may be publicly distributed or otherwise made
publicly available in Switzerland.

Neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering or marketing material relating to the Offering, the Issuers, or the
Notes have been or will be filed with or approved by any Swiss regulatory authority. In particular, this offering
memorandum will not be filed with, and the offer of Notes will not be supervised by, the Swiss Financial Market


-----

Supervisory Authority, and the Offering has not been and will not be authorized under the Swiss Federal Act on Collective
Investment Schemes (the “CISA”). The investor protection afforded to acquirers of interests in collective investment
schemes under the CISA does not extend to acquirers of Notes.

**Notice to Investors in the United Kingdom**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment in respect of
the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the
FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No.
600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of
the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK
**MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the**
Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within
the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations
made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the UK has been or will be prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be made pursuant to
an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK
**Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is**
not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

of the purchaser’s province of residence for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

**Presentation of Financial and Other Information**

**Presentation of Financial Information**

The historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum is that of Laboratoire Eimer and its
consolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, all references to “we”, “us”, “our”, “Biogroup” or the
“Group” in respect of historical financial information in this offering memorandum are to Laboratoire Eimer and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

This offering memorandum includes the following financial information of Laboratoire Eimer and its subsidiaries:

� the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019
prepared in accordance with French GAAP (each the “2017 Audited Financial Statements”, “2018 Audited
**Financial Statements”, and “2019 Audited Financial Statements”, respectively, and collectively, the “Audited**
**Financial Statements”); and**

� the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020,
prepared in accordance with French GAAP (the “Unaudited Interim Financial Statements”).

The Indentures will require us to report consolidated financial statements and other information for Laboratoire Eimer and
its subsidiaries. The fiscal year of Laboratoire Eimer ends on December 31 of each calendar year. The consolidated
financial statements of Laboratoire Eimer included in this offering memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect the
impact of any changes to the income statements, balance sheets or cash flow statements that might occur as a result of
purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of acquisitions, including the Acquisitions. However, Laboratoire
Eimer will account for acquisitions (including the Acquisitions) using the purchase method of accounting under French
GAAP. The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we
may add to our balance sheet, which may include intangible assets such as goodwill, and different amortization and
depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future financial statements could be materially
different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the Audited Financial Statements or Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements”._

Certain figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial data presented in millions or thousands and
percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in
this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. Percentages and
amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data set forth in “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are calculated using the numerical data in our consolidated_
financial statements or the tabular presentation of other data (subject to rounding) contained in this offering memorandum,
as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

**Unaudited Pro Forma** **Financial Information**

We also present in this offering memorandum the unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement of the Group for the
year ended December 31, 2019 (the “2019 Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statement Information”) and the nine months
ended September 30, 2020 (the “9M2020 Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statement Information” and together with the
2019 Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statement Information, the “Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statement
**Information”) and unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2020 (the “Unaudited Pro Forma**
**Balance Sheet Information” and collectively with the Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statement Information, the**
“Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information”).

The Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet Information combines (i) the balance sheet from the Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements of Laboratoire Eimer for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 (which fully consolidated the subsidiaries
of Laborizon as of such date) and (ii) the balance sheets from the unaudited financial statements of the Medina subsidiaries


-----

for the same period, in each case subject to certain adjustments as described in “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated
_Financial Information.”_

The Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statement Information combines (i) the income statement from the 2019 Audited
Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements of Laboratoire Eimer for the year ended December
31, 2019 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, including certain pro forma financial information included in
the notes thereto, (ii) the audited individual income statements of the Laborizon subsidiaries for the year ended December
31, 2019 and (iii) audited individual income statements of the Medina subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2019
and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, in each case subject to certain adjustments as described in “Unaudited
_Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information.”_

We present the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information to illustrate the estimated effects of the Acquisitions on the
historical consolidated financial position and results of operations of the Group, as if the Acquisitions had occurred on the
first day of the relevant period described in such Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information (the first day of each such
relevant period being January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2020, respectively).

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information has been prepared based on available information for illustrative purposes
only and does not represent what our actual results would have been had the Acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2019 or
January 1, 2020, as applicable, nor does it purport to project our results of operation at any future date. The Unaudited Pro
Forma Financial Information included in this offering memorandum has not been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act, IFRS or U.S. GAAP. Neither the adjustments nor the
resulting Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information have been audited. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information
has not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statements that might occur as a result of final
purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the Acquisitions.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are
reasonable but is not necessarily indicative of the results that would have actually been achieved if the Acquisitions had
been completed on the dates indicated, or indicative of the results that may be achieved in the future. The Unaudited Pro
Forma Financial Information is provided for informational purposes only. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Business—Our pro forma consolidated financial information may not be representative of our results as a Group;_
_additionally, our actual financial condition and results of operations may differ materially.”_

This offering memorandum contains non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact), and certain coverage ratios
that are not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, French GAAP or IFRS. Such measures and ratios
may not reflect accurately our performance, liquidity or our ability to incur debt and should not be considered as alternatives
to operating income/(loss) or net profit/(loss) or any other performance measures derived from or in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, SEC requirements or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to net cash provided by/
(used in) operating activities. The financial information contained in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply
with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC. As used in this offering
memorandum, the following terms have the following meanings:

� **EBITDA represents operating income/(loss) plus the income statement line items for depreciation and**
amortization expenses. The income statement line items net change in depreciation and amortization expenses
include, among others, provisions for risks and charges, fixed assets depreciation and amortization charges and
provision on current assets.

� **Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for certain items, either positive or negative, which our**
management considers to be non-recurring in nature as well as certain non-cash items that management does not
consider to be representative of the underlying performance of the business, including:

� Non-recurring costs and expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and legal reorganization;


-----

� temporary reduction in prices of medical lab tests imposed by regulatory authorities at the end of 2018;

� tax credits and CVAE costs to follow the classification that would have applied under IFRS;

� restatement to present the retroactive effect of change in consolidation method of certain subsidiaries;
and

� certain accounting adjustments;

� **Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.**

� **Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted for the full run rate effect on**
our Adjusted EBITDA from the companies we acquired between October 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020, as if
such acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2019 or January 1, 2020, as the case may be, estimated cost
savings and synergies from these acquisitions on an annual run rate basis and an elimination of the transaction
costs associated with such acquisitions.

� **Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA** **(excluding COVID-19 impact) represents Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as**
further adjusted for the full period effect on our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA based on the restatement of the
negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the EBITDA occurred during the first lockdown between March
and May 2020, and the restatement of the additional EBITDA generated by COVID-19 related testing activity
while adding back any recurring COVID-19 impact, such as PCR testing required for international travellers
before being authorized to board international flights.

For more information, see “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other Financial and Operating
_Data”._

This offering memorandum contains certain synergy estimates, among others, relating to cost reductions and other benefits
expected to arise from the Acquisitions as well as adjustments for related costs to implement such acquisitions. The
estimates present the expected future impact of these transactions and the integration of these companies into our existing
business on a run-rate basis. Such estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information
available to us and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating the synergies
arising from these acquisitions are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic,
and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the
synergy benefit estimates.

We present Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19
impact) for informational purposes only. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each
of the acquisitions or other transactions for which an adjustment is made occurred at the dates indicated. There is no
assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items
will not be incurred in the future. The calculations for Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) are based on various assumptions (including the successful
implementation of certain initiatives), management estimates and the unaudited management accounts of the acquired
businesses. These amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent
accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete
picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the acquired businesses or other transactions for the periods
presented, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in
this offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision.

We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding
COVID-19 impact) because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability
to service our debt. These measures are not measurements of financial performance under French GAAP or IFRS and
should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure
of performance derived in accordance with French GAAP or IFRS. EBITDA and its variants as presented in this offering


-----

memorandum may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies and from “Consolidated EBITDA”
contained in the sections entitled “Description of the Senior Notes” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” of this
offering memorandum and in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes Indenture. For a reconciliation of
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19
impact) to operating income (loss), see “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information —Other Financial and
_Operating Data”._

We also present net sales from organic growth, which we calculate as the variation of net sales generated in any two
subsequent years on the basis of a constant scope of consolidation for the first of these two years. This approach results in
a growing organic growth portfolio over time and does not allow for comparison across all periods presented in this offering
memorandum. These organic growth figures may deviate from the presentation of organic growth in our historic and future
financial reporting, which is computed on a dynamic basis, comparing against the perimeter of the relevant prior-year
period. Net sales and pro forma net sales from organic growth are prepared by our management and provide a useful
measure of our ongoing organic performance but are not included in our historical financial information or prepared in
accordance with French GAAP or IFRS.

The non-French GAAP measures presented in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for analysis of our operating results as reported under French GAAP. Some of the limitations of each of these non-French
GAAP measures are:

� they do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

� they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital;

� they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments, on indebtedness;

� they do not reflect income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;

� although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will
often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements;
and

� other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) differently than as
presented in this offering memorandum, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) and the related ratios presented throughout this offering memorandum should not
be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in business growth or reduce indebtedness.

**As Adjusted Financial Information**

We present in this offering memorandum certain as adjusted financial information for Laboratoire Eimer and CAB, which
is based on the unaudited interim consolidated financial information, unaudited pro forma financial information or pro
forma adjusted financial information for the Issuers, in each case on an as adjusted basis to reflect certain effects of the
Transactions and the Medina Acquisition on the indebtedness, cash position and interest expense of the Issuers as of and
for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. See “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other
_Financial and Operating Data.” This as adjusted financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and_
does not represent what our actual interest expense would have been had the Offering occurred on September 30, 2020 or
what our actual cash position or indebtedness would have been had the Transactions and the Medina Acquisition occurred
on September 30, 2020, nor does it purport to project our indebtedness, cash position or interest expense at any future date.


-----

The adjusted financial information has not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statement,
balance sheet or cash flow statement that might occur as a result of application of the acquisition method of accounting
under French GAAP, which will affect the comparability of the Issuers’ future consolidated financial statements with the
financial statements contained in this offering memorandum. The as adjusted financial information has not been prepared
in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any
generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the resulting adjusted
financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.

**Differences between French GAAP and IFRS**

We include in this offering memorandum financial information prepared under French GAAP. French GAAP differs in
significant respects from IFRS. Given the differences between French GAAP and IFRS, if we were to prepare our financial
statements on the basis of IFRS instead of French GAAP, we cannot guarantee that there could not be substantial
differences in our results of operations, cash flows and balance sheet, including levels of indebtedness. Prospective
investors are advised to consult their professional advisors for an understanding of: (i) the differences between French
GAAP and other systems of generally accepted accounting principles and how those differences might affect the financial
information included in this offering memorandum; and (ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments of, French
GAAP may have on the financial information presented in this offering memorandum, our results of operations and/or
financial condition, as well as on the comparability of prior periods. For a discussion of certain differences between French
GAAP and IFRS as applied by us, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Certain differences between French GAAP and IFRS”._

**Industry and Market Information**

Unless otherwise expressly indicated or noted below, all information regarding markets, market size, market share, market
position, growth rates and other industry data pertaining to our business contained in this offering memorandum are based
on estimates prepared by us based on certain assumptions and our knowledge of the industry in which we operate, as well
as data from various market research publications, publicly available information and industry publications, including
reports published by various third-party sources. Industry publications generally state that the information they contain has
been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not
guaranteed. We have not independently verified such data. We use a combination of data provided by the French Court of
Audit (Cour des Comptes), the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (“INSEE”), the Directorate
for Research, Studies, Assessments and Statistics (“DREES”), the French National Health Insurance Fund (“CNAMTS”)
for the French market, the Belgian National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (“RIZIV/INAMI”) for the
Belgian market and other industry sources.

In many cases, there is no readily available external information (whether from trade associations, government bodies or
other organizations) to validate market-related analysis and estimates, requiring us to rely on our own internally developed
estimates regarding the industry in which we operate, our position in the industry, our market share and the market shares
of various industry participants based on experience, our own investigation of market conditions and our review of industry
publications, including information made available to the public by our competitors. While we have examined and relied
upon certain market or other industry data from external sources as the basis for our estimates, including an industry report
prepared by a major third party consulting firm (the “industry report”) and a sustainability analysis report prepared by a
third party independent strategy advisor (the “sustainability report”), which were commissioned by Biogroup, neither we
nor the Initial Purchasers have verified that data. We and the Initial Purchasers cannot assure you of, and take no
responsibility for, the accuracy and completeness of such data. Similarly, while we believe our internal estimates to be
reasonable, these estimates have not been verified by any independent source and we and the Initial Purchasers cannot
assure you as to their accuracy. Our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various
factors, including those discussed under “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements”. Furthermore, the markets in
which we operate and compete may have shifted or changed since the date that the industry report was prepared and in
particular, the industry report may not contemplate the effects of COVID-19. These and other factors could cause results
to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by us.

Industry publications, surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from
sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. Where we
have found information from different sources to be conflicting, we have used the information that we believe to be the
most accurate and prepared on a basis consistent with the other sources we have used.

The contents of any website, including the websites of any member of the Group, do not form any part of this offering
memorandum.

**Overview**

We are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in France and Belgium, providing medical
laboratory testing services through a large and dense network of 742 collection sites across seven regions in France and in
the Flanders region in Belgium as of the date of this offering memorandum. We focus mainly on routine lab testing which
is conducted exclusively in-house and also offer specialized tests which can be performed in-house or outsourced to our
outsourcing partner, Biomnis. Our in-house testing generally comprises approximately 98% of our test volume. We
outsource only a small portion of specialized tests with low demand (thereby less profitable to invest in resources to conduct
the tests in-house). In France, our customers are mainly patients, whereas our Belgian customers are generally both doctors
and patients. Our local technical platforms also assist nearby clinics with their medical testing demands.

We perform a range of over 372 medical lab tests with varying degrees of automation, complexity and volume (including
clinical biochemistry, molecular diagnostics, infertility diagnosis, tumor marker testing, microbiology, cytology and
pathology, allergy tests and genetic tests) for patients who have either generally been prescribed these tests by their doctors
or who elect to get tested for certain non-prescribed medical tests.

We have grown our market presence in France and Belgium through acquisitions of technical platforms and large networks
of nearby collection sites in regions with attractive demographic factors (such as high density populations, aging
populations and affluence), followed by smaller bolt-on acquisitions to create density around technical platforms and ensure
maximization of operating efficiency. Through over 45 acquisitions since 2015, we have demonstrated our ability to
consistently deliver on forecast synergies and cost savings, and extract best-in-class profitability. Our founder and
shareholder Dr. Stéphane Eimer’s strategic vision and successful track record of consolidation, expertise, industry
knowledge and network, further assisted by our investors and competent management at local laboratory levels, historically
have been an important differentiator during these acquisitions, and our culture as a scientifically-led organization (driven
by ownership by a medical biologist instead of a financial sponsor) uniquely sets us apart from our competitors.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, our pro forma net sales were €1,315.2 million and our Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) was €386.2 million. See “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other
_Information—Other Financial and Operating Data.”_

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Present in growing and resilient markets characterized by strong fundamentals and providing further growth_**
**_opportunities_**

Our core markets are the routine outpatient private laboratory testing markets in France and Belgium. These markets
generated approximately €4.7 billion and €0.6 billion in net sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and have experienced
steady underlying growth. We believe that we benefit from resilient, non-cyclical demand for clinical diagnostics services
that delivers reliable organic growth. This growth is due in part to favorable market drivers in France and Belgium, such
as an aging population, population growth, growth in the prevalence of chronic diseases, driven by lifestyle trends such as
low levels of physical activity, poor nutrition and stress, an increase in the number of consultations per inhabitant and
number of tests per consultation and increasing focus on disease prevention. We believe these factors are conducive to
increased testing frequency, driving volume growth in the market, while the essential nature of the testing services we
provide contributes to demand resilience, as exhibited during the COVID-19 pandemic by the significant increase in


-----

volume of medical tests due to the demand for COVID-19-related testing, as well as by the gradual return of routine testing
volume to normal levels as movement and other restrictions have been lifted.

Prompt and accurate diagnostic testing improves the quality of patient care and reduces the overall cost of healthcare. As
a result, the governments in France and Belgium (which fund approximately 70% and between 70% and 100%,
respectively, of tests conducted in France and Belgium by value) have promoted the use of medical testing as preventive
care, which has led to growth in demand for medical lab testing generally. Due to the high volume of testing needs and
limited testing capacity of the public sector, public hospital laboratories have increasingly outsourced testing to private
providers. The fiscal constraints of the public sector further contribute to the private sector’s continued growth to meet the
increasing demand.

Net sales of laboratory companies in France and Belgium are subject to annual budgets established in advance through
industry-wide agreements with regulatory authorities, which set the prices for routine medical testing in advance. For
example, in France, pursuant to a triennial agreement in March 2020 with medical biologists’ labor unions (the “Current
**Triennial Plan”), the annual budget growth for medical lab tests is set for three years, and allows an increase of up to**
0.40% in 2020, 0.50% in 2021 and 0.60% in 2022. In Belgium, prices of routine tests in the private medical laboratory
testing market in Belgium are set by the national healthcare regulatory body, RIZIV/INAMI, and are revised at least on an
annual basis and historically have increased by approximately 1% per annum since 2010, with national social welfare
agency contributions roughly tracking inflation and patient contribution levels remaining stable. As a result, our net sales
are easily predictable. These annual budgets set a baseline, with prices increasing or decreasing depending on how the
market value of laboratory testing compares to the annual budgets. In addition to the government-regulated price, in
Belgium we have the option to charge the patient an additional amount, typically up to 10% of the government-regulated
price. Although these agreements create significant pricing pressure, they also protect our industry from unforeseen
external shocks, because they provide an additional budget for a predetermined level of overall market growth and to meet
the increased need for tests during an exceptional event.

The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates how this system works. Regulatory authorities in France and Belgium have provided
an additional budget for COVID-19-related tests separate from its annual budget for lab testing. Moreover, the decrease in
routine medical lab testing during COVID-19 pandemic, which will likely place market value below the annual budget,
may in fact lead to a price increase for medical lab tests we perform, subject to negotiation with our regulators.

We expect that the increased demand for COVID-19-related testing activity (such as polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”)
and serology testing), which had not previously contributed to the market value of traditional medical laboratory testing
services, will continue to provide significant additional upside to lab operators in the short term. In the long-term, our
incremental PCR testing capacity can be used for tests to detect non-COVID-19-related infectious diseases, such as
microbiology tests, which we expect will mitigate future decreases in PCR testing volumes. We also expect routine testing
volumes to increase from greater public familiarity with diagnostic testing and its benefits, as well as the emergence of
new tests in the “routine” segment of the market. Moreover, the increased public awareness of the central importance of
medical laboratory testing services resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may benefit medical laboratory testing
providers in future price negotiations with the relevant regulatory authorities. We believe we are well placed to benefit
from these trends, because we are one of the few private testing providers in France and Belgium that are capable of
providing PCR testing, due to our advanced equipment used to perform PCR tests. We currently perform one of the largest
shares of PCR testing in France and Belgium.

For a further discussion of our markets and their underlying competitive dynamics, see “Industry”.

**_Leading market position driving strong historical growth and EBITDA margin_**

We are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in both of our core markets, France and
Belgium. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, we generated pro forma net sales of €1,315.2 million, including
net sales of €1,138.6 million in France (including CBM25) and €176.7 million of pro forma net sales in Belgium through
the Medina Group, which we acquired in October 2020. As a large incumbent operator in France and Belgium, we are able
to leverage significant economies of scale both (i) financially, benefitting from strong negotiating positions with key
suppliers and (ii) operationally, through our ability to react quickly and at scale to respond to regulatory or other changes,


-----

such as our rapid roll-out of COVID-19-related PCR testing capabilities at the start of the pandemic. These attributes have
allowed us to deliver a best-in-class Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) margin of 33.4% for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2020.

Through our large-scale and successful consolidation of smaller operators, we have developed a network of approximately
742 collection sites across France and Belgium with the capacity to deliver up to 153,000 tests per day as of September
2020. Moreover, we have historically experienced very low churn among our medical biologists. Biologists at acquired
laboratories are incentivized to remain within our Group following the acquisition and integration of targets due to a
combination of financial, structural and cultural factors, such as our profit sharing system, the decentralized management
of each laboratory site, which leverages centralized regional technical platform capabilities to achieve cost savings, and
the fact that we are owned and managed by Dr. Stéphane Eimer, a medical biologist. This low churn has historically
provided us with substantial institutional knowledge at both the local and regional levels, promoting continuity and
operational efficiency as new targets are integrated into our Group’s network on an ongoing basis.

We have executed our consolidation strategy with discipline and speed, having successfully integrated over 45 acquisitions
since 2015. The chart below sets forth the growth in the number of our collection sites since Laboratoire Eimer was founded
in 1998.

Our consolidation strategy has allowed us to generate, on a compounded basis, an annual pro forma net sales growth rate
of over 60% and an annual pro forma EBITDA growth rate of over 70% from 2015 to 2019, demonstrating the effectiveness
of scale in enhancing our financial performance. A key factor in ensuring EBITDA margins are effectively extracted from
new acquisitions is our ability to quickly manage staff costs (mainly by substituting part of the cash compensation of
biologists at the newly acquired laboratory with equity), supplier costs (through application of the terms of our existing
framework agreements immediately after closing and post-acquisition reagent price renegotiations with suppliers
benefiting from the Group’s increased scale) and other operating costs of target labs in order to rapidly realize operating
synergies.

**_Integrated and efficient business model with a dense network of collection sites covering a wide range of diagnostic_**
**_applications in-house_**

We believe our integrated network model allows us to benefit from significant cost savings and a high utilization rate of
our technical platforms, which leads to greater profitability. We have focused on building a series of dense networks in
each of the geographic regions we have chosen to enter, leveraging a “hub-and-spoke” network model of distributed
collection sites clustered tightly around state-of-the-art, well-invested technical platforms with, in our view, the latest and
most efficient equipment. With an average of 65 collection sites per region in France (by categorizing our operating regions
into a total of 11 regions in France), as compared to a competitor average of 30, we are able to centralize sample analysis
of a large number of collection sites around each of our best-in-class technical platforms to achieve cost savings and
optimize the utilization rate for each platform.

We have focused strategically on regions within France that exhibit attractive fundamental demographic characteristics,
such as rapidly growing or aging populations, metropolitan areas with above-average population density and relative


-----

affluence. These areas, such as Ile-de-France, Auvergne Rhône-Alpes and the PACA regions, drive higher testing volumes
than more rural or less affluent regions and consequently enable us to operate at greater levels of efficiency with faster test
turnaround speeds and higher margins. In line with this strategy, we entered the Belgian market through our acquisition of
the Medina Group in October 2020, which is located in densely populated areas, thus enabling a high level of operational
efficiency.

We cover all of the routine laboratory testing phases in-house, from initial collection of samples from patients or healthcare
providers to post-analytical biological validation and results reporting. Approximately 93% of our pro forma net sales in
2019 were derived from our testing services that are conducted in-house. Our strong in-house analytical capabilities
(including our innovative testing automation capabilities enabled by best-in-class equipment), combined with our dense
network of collection sites located in close proximity to technical platforms, allow us to optimize our operations and achieve
a quick turnaround of testing results with fewer staff. We estimate that we revert with test results within 12 hours for a
majority of tests. We also offer a comprehensive service across a wide scope of medical tests, including clinical chemistry,
hematology, allergy, microbiology, immunochemistry, molecular diagnostics, cytology and fertility tests. See “Business—
_Our Business—Overview” for more information._

Furthermore, for our operations in France in particular, we believe that our strategic focus on the B2C routine lab segment
and limited exposure to outsourced testing drive our EBITDA margin outperformance. By concentrating on B2C routine
lab testing (which generally generates a higher margin than B2B) and maintaining limited outsourcing (which is generally
more expensive than in-house testing), we benefit from greater profitability than some of our peers that have a B2B business
model and/or outsource a greater proportion of tests. We generally perform approximately 98% of our analysis by volume
in-house, and outsource only a small portion of testing to our outsourcing partner, Biomnis, for certain specialized tests
with low demand (and therefore less profitable to invest in resources to conduct the tests in-house). If an outsourced test
becomes sufficiently recurrent, we may decide to make an investment and purchase or lease the necessary equipment and
hire the appropriate staff to be able to perform the test in-house. See “Business—Our Business” for more information.

Finally, our centralized procurement function and limited number of suppliers allow us to better absorb pricing pressures
and improve profitability. We generally engage only one or two suppliers per service and type of purchase, who provide
the relevant service and products nationally to our collection sites and technical platforms. This centralization helps our
group-level procurement team negotiate better terms with our reagent and equipment suppliers pursuant to master supply
agreements, which also benefit our acquired targets post-acquisition. This approach allows us to achieve a competitive net
sales margin while harmonizing best practices across our network. See “Business—Our Suppliers” for more information.

**_Incumbent leadership position strengthened by significant barriers to entry_**

We believe that our competitive position is bolstered by several significant barriers to entry for private medical lab testing
market in France and Belgium.

We operate in a highly regulated industry with stringent, complex mandatory operating license accreditation frameworks.
These requirements can be onerous for providers without a critical scale in the market to support the resources necessary
to achieve and maintain compliance, creating an environment naturally conducive to consolidation. We are subject to
onerous licensing and certification regimes, particularly in Belgium where there is a de facto stop on the granting of new
licenses, thus making it difficult to increase the number of new licenses. We collaborate closely with regulators to stay up–
to-date with the latest regulatory developments in the markets where we operate. For our French operations in particular,
our Quality Director is also a member of COFRAC (Comité français d’accréditation), which supervises French laboratories
to ensure that they are up–to-date on regulatory requirements. Our relationship with COFRAC provides us with a significant
advantage compared to new entrants, particularly with respect to obtaining accreditation under the new accreditation
requirement pursuant to the more rigorous ISO 15189 standard, under which we plan to apply for 100% accreditation by
the April 30, 2021 deadline; we aim to obtain accreditation under the ISO 9001 standard by 2023. In our Belgian operations,
all of our collection sites and technical platforms are accredited under the relevant quality standards issued by Sciensano,
Belgium’s Scientific Institute for Public Health. All but one of our collection sites in Belgium have obtained the BELAC
accreditation in line with the ISO 15189 standard. See “Business—Quality Standards” for more information.


-----

Moreover, the constraints on ownership of laboratory companies in France are burdensome to potential market entrants, in
particular overseas investors, making it more difficult to achieve scale or establish a new business. French law requires inhouse biologists to retain a majority of voting rights and, subject to certain exceptions, share capital of the subsidiaries they
own. Generally, our acquisition targets’ biologists will retain some equity interest post-acquisition. See “Business—Our
_Corporate Structure (SEL/SELAS)” and “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure” for more information._

Our “hub-and-spoke” network model further allows us to leverage economies of scale. We operate in several regions
through a combination of multiple collection sites serviced by a centralized technical platform where tests are actually
performed, which allows us to reduce our fixed costs (comprised largely of staff and facilities costs) and deliver a broad
range of testing services at a lower cost per unit than a new entrant is likely to be able to achieve. This scale also gives us
negotiating power to procure reagents and equipment on more advantageous terms, as well as in M&A processes.

Further, our industry know-how and deep scientific expertise, combined with our dense network of collection sites, allow
us to deliver diagnostic testing services quickly and accurately at the convenience of the customers. Convenience (including
proximity for individual patients, our main customers in France), fast turnaround and quality of testing results are important
factors for patients and doctors (our main customers in Belgium) in selecting laboratories. As an incumbent already
equipped with experienced biologists across multiple regions and state-of-the-art technical platforms with the latest
technology that can handle large testing volumes efficiently, we have been able to promptly deliver testing results for a
broad range of routine lab tests.

Our successful track record and our strong reputation also act as powerful barriers to entry. Developing a reputation for
convenience and quality takes time to build, and we believe Biogroup’s strong reputation (including the strength of our
subsidiaries’ reputations, such as Medina Group) in diagnostic services in France and Belgium enables us to attract
customers, staff and potential acquisition targets over competitors, ensuring that our testing volumes, skill and technical
capabilities are maintained and grow over time. The high-volume nature of the routine laboratory testing business requires
substantial managerial and organizational competence to implement high quality standards throughout the network. Our
decentralized management structure allows for best practices to be identified based on local experience, while our scale
and infrastructure allow for best practices to be shared and implemented across the Group. Our fast turnaround in delivering
test results and the convenience of the proximity of testing sites to patients, due to our existing dense network in the regions
we operate, also provide a significant advantage over new entrants. Moreover, for our Belgian operations, we believe that
our commitment to building and maintaining relationships with doctors, is also integral to continuing to grow our market
share. Doctors tend to return to their existing preferred laboratory services provider as a one-stop shop for all of the analyses
they need for their patients, and our existing relationship with these customers makes it more difficult for entrants to
penetrate. Lastly, our profile has increased significantly as a result of our COVID-19 testing response due in part to
increased media coverage, which will be difficult for other entrants to establish in the short-term.

**_Established consolidation strategy with disciplined acquisition criteria_**

We have a strong track record as a preeminent consolidator in the French diagnostic testing space. Through over 45
acquisitions since 2015, we have demonstrated an ability to consistently deliver on forecast synergies and effectively
integrate newly acquired laboratories with speed and efficiency. We maintain a proven and established M&A policy,
drawing on the experience and track record of our senior leadership team to facilitate rapid decision making through a
standardized M&A process.

The consolidation strategy that we have pursued since 2015 has been a balance of speed with discipline. We have deployed
a tactical roll-up approach on a region-by-region basis, focusing on establishing technical platform hubs in new,
strategically attractive geographic regions meeting certain criteria (including the demographic factors described above),
balanced with smaller bolt-on acquisitions to create density around the technical platform and ensure maximization of
operating efficiency. Our decentralized management model also allow us to leverage our local management’s knowledge
and relationships in the regions in which we operate to source potential acquisitions and optimize post-acquisition
integration measures, such as opening new collection sites in the best locations based on their local knowledge and
harmonization of network. We also benefit from their existing relationship with local governmental bodies and regional
health agencies.


-----

The potential for synergies and cost savings with our existing technical platform and laboratory network is an important
criteria for our selection of targets for future acquisitions. We have a successful track record of achieving synergies and
cost savings due in part to our systematic approach of promptly integrating targets into our centralized framework
agreements, the majority of which we are able to achieve between the first day following the closing of the acquisition and
within a few weeks thereafter. For example, our acquisitions of Bioesterel in December 2018 and Biolittoral in June 2019
both resulted in EBITDA margin increases which exceeded our initial target margin. See “Business—Our Growth through
_Acquisitions” for more information on the increases in EBITDA margin. We have our targets accede to our supplier master_
agreements as soon as possible post-acquisition, which allows the targets to benefit from our existing competitive price
and fee arrangements soon after an acquisition has been completed. We also selectively conduct certain tests previously
outsourced by the target in-house, outsourcing those that remain to Biomnis, benefitting from our existing contractual
outsourcing arrangements at a competitive margin. See “Business—Our Growth through Acquisitions” for more
information.

In addition, we believe that the French regulatory regime governing the ownership of laboratory companies aligns the
interests of our Group and our targets and minimizes churn of senior-level specialized biologists at the target level. The
biologists’ retention of an equity stake at the target level also prevents disruption of the target’s business post-acquisition
and facilitates the post-acquisition integration process.

In evaluating transactions, we seek to benchmark pricing against prevailing market conditions at the time, while taking into
account the size and strategic significance of any given acquisition. When assessing a potential target, we generally consider
those within a range of applicable EBITDA multiples which depends on the size of the target’s business. With smaller
targets, we pursue acquisitions at lower EBITDA multiples, whereas for larger targets, we would consider paying a higher
EBITDA multiple.

**_Strong, resilient financial performance bolstered by high margins and strong cash flow generation_**

We have a strong track record of growth, with our annual pro forma revenue growth growing over 60% from 2015 to 2019.
From 2018 to 2019, we have generated organic net sales growth of 2% in France and 3-4% in Belgium from 2010 to 2018,
exceeding that of the overall market (approximately 0.8% from 2014 to 2019 in France and 2-3% from 2010 to 2018 in
Belgium) due in part to our structural exposure to regions exhibiting greater organic growth in testing volumes. Our
historical organic growth in Ile-de-France, the largest market in France, was 2.8% from 2016 to 2019, which was well
above the market average of 1.1% from 2014 to 2019.

Our above-market organic growth trajectory has been supported by our strategy of selectively investing in geographic
regions that exhibit attractive demographic characteristics, such as rapidly growing or aging populations, metropolitan
areas with above-average population density and relative affluence. Within each of the geographic regions we have chosen
to enter, we have built a dense network of collection sites which leverage centralized regional technical platform
capabilities to achieve cost savings. Our scale and infrastructure allow us to achieve economies of scale in negotiating with
suppliers, while allowing us to survey a broad array of best practices which are adopted across the Group.

Our efficient operational approach has allowed us to generate Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact)
of €386.2 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 and a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID19 impact) margin of 33.4% during the same time period, which we believe to have outperformed our peers in our core
markets.

Our business has maintained stable margins and cash conversion over a number of years, despite significant growth. Our
Adjusted EBITDA margins were 31.0%, 27.7% and 29.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019,
respectively. Our adjusted free cash flow, which we calculate as Adjusted EBITDA less changes in net working capital
and net capital expenditure, was €61.4 million, €67.6 million, €165.9 million and €158.8 million for the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. Our cash flow
performance was also strong, with EBITDA representing 74% of our net cash flow from operating activities for the year
ended December 31, 2019, due to our structurally negative working capital profile and limited capital expenditure (2.2%
of net sales generated during 2019). Our cash flow conversion ratio, which we calculate as our adjusted free cash flow as


-----

a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA, was 87.5%, 70.0%, 92.2% and 63.7% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018
and 2019 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.

In addition, we typically do not acquire any diagnostic instrumentation (except for PCR testing equipment, which we
purchased in March 2020 in response to increasing demand due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic) and lease our
equipment from our reagent suppliers. See “Business—Our Suppliers” for more information. This approach benefits us by
limiting ongoing maintenance capital expenditures.

**_Highly experienced and agile management team with an entrepreneurial spirit supported by committed shareholders_**
**_and investors_**

We have an experienced management team with substantial scientific and commercial experience in the diagnostic testing
sector. Our majority shareholder, Chairman and CEO, Dr. Stéphane Eimer, is a trained pharmacist and medical biologist
who founded Laboratoire Eimer in 1998 and maintains control over our operations.

Our senior leadership and culture (driven by a medical biologist instead of a financial sponsor) distinguishes us from our
competitors. Dr. Eimer’s strategic vision and long and successful track record of consolidation have helped drive our
growth. His knowledge and reputation among other biologists in the industry have historically been an important
differentiator during our M&A processes, compared with certain sponsor-backed peers. Dr. Eimer’s deep and long-standing
relationships with suppliers allow us to benefit from competitive margins under our supply agreements. For more
information about our management, see “Management”. Dr. Eimer’s strategy is also to cultivate strong management teams
at the local level. Our network of regional management teams, incentivized with minority shareholdings in their respective
laboratories, further provide strength and depth of experience at each level of the Group and ensure high quality and
consistency of operational initiatives across our Group. We believe that our corporate infrastructure provides the necessary
framework for improving performance and sharing best practices across our network. Our senior and regional management
structure has allowed us to retain our culture as a scientifically-led organization and promote our reputation as the provider
of choice in the routine outpatient diagnostic testing market in France and Belgium.

Our de-centralized governance structure across our network also allows us to make agile investment decisions, thereby
enabling us to achieve a high rate of successful completed acquisitions. This agility has been recently demonstrated in our
response to the emergence of COVID-19, where our management team ramped up the installation of PCR testing
equipment, securing a cornerstone position in the provision of testing in France and an approximate 20% market share of
all COVID-19 tests in France (public and private) as of the week of November 2, 2020. As of January 10, 2021, we have
performed more than 6.9 million PCR tests and 0.7 million serology tests for COVID-19 in France (including tests
performed by companies acquired in 2020 prior to their acquisition date), and as of the end of December 2020, we had
performed approximately 0.8 million PCR tests and 0.1 million serology tests in Belgium.

Moreover, we are supported by blue-chip institutional investors who share the long-term strategic objectives of the
management team and bring substantial experience in operating in the healthcare sector. We maintain regular
communication with our key institutional investors, CDPQ, ICG and Straco, who have approval rights with respect to
external acquisitions and financings that exceed a certain level. See “Principal Shareholders, Investors and Related Party
_Transactions—Key Institutional Investors”._

**Our Strategy**

**_Selectively pursue acquisitions_**

We are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in France and, since the Medina Acquisition,
in Belgium, operating in seven regions in France and in the Flanders region in Belgium. The laboratory testing markets in
both France and Belgium remain fragmented, and we regularly identify numerous near and medium term potential
consolidation opportunities in both markets. We therefore plan to continue expanding our footprint within all of these
regions through acquisitions and increasing the density of collection sites serving existing and additional technical
platforms, reinforcing our “hub-and-spoke” network model.


-----

We expect acquisitions in the regions in which we are already present to be primarily small- and mid-sized bolt-on
acquisitions that can quickly and effectively be integrated into our existing network infrastructure to realize significant
operating synergies and cost savings at these sites. We will closely appraise potential targets based on their location relative
to our existing facilities, as well as other factors, including customer accessibility. We will prioritize sites that we believe
will help drive testing volume growth for our technical platforms and further increase our market share. We will also
leverage our local medical biologists’ knowledge of the market and their relationships with the management of potential
targets. We aim to finance such bolt-on acquisitions with our organic free cash flow.

We also intend to expand into new regions in France and Belgium which fit specific demographic criteria that we believe
will drive increasing testing volumes, such as regions with rapidly growing or aging populations, metropolitan areas with
above-average population density and relative affluence. Acquisitions in new regions are likely to focus on mid-sized to
larger targets that we believe will provide us with sufficient scale and both local collection sites and technical platforms.
Once such acquisitions are completed and our operations are integrated, we may seek to further consolidate our position
and enhance network density through smaller bolt-on acquisitions.

Moreover, we continue to selectively assess potential acquisition opportunities in other European markets which we believe
present attractive demographic characteristics and opportunities to develop a significant scale of lab testing operations by
leveraging our experience in France and Belgium. Acquisitions in new markets are likely to be mid- to large-size
transactions.

**_Drive organic volume growth across our markets and raise brand recognition_**

Our goal is to continue delivering organic growth superior to the growth of the markets in which we operate. We intend to
achieve this through our continued focus on operational excellence and improved customer experience and satisfaction. In
particular, we believe that the continued development of our established laboratory network will further foster successful
organic growth and help us to maintain and expand on the established relationships we hold with key stakeholders across
the industry.

We continue to monitor our geographic footprint closely to ensure that our portfolio is distributed in accordance with our
strategic criteria. Areas of higher density, aging population and affluence will be targeted for greater investment and
improvement, with a particular focus on sites offering enhanced customer convenience and other characteristics that will
help continue to drive volume growth.

We further intend to remain alert to changing trends in testing patterns and ready to respond quickly where these trends are
identified. We remain open to the selective expansion of our testing portfolio within our wider strategy of maintaining a
primary focus on routine B2C testing. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, there is potential for a step-change in public
attitudes toward diagnostic testing and, as demonstrated by our initial reaction to the emergence of the virus, we are able
to respond quickly as these trends are identified to ensure that we continue to provide a comprehensive end-to-end
diagnostic testing service.

Finally, our profile has increased significantly as a result of our COVID-19 testing response and we plan to use this as a
platform to further develop customer awareness, establish solid branding and reputation and promote public understanding
of us and our service offering to drive additional B2C volumes.

**_Continue to deliver operating efficiencies and maintain best-in-class margins_**

We will continue to maintain our established growth trajectory in line with our historical acquisitions, and leverage the
economies of scale that historical and future acquisitions can deliver. Our scale is our core differentiator in France and
Belgium and the source of our primary competitive advantage over smaller peers. Our size allows us to benefit from
operational and supply chain efficiencies and to survey a broad landscape for best practices, which we can then benchmark
and adopt across our network. Our market leadership and culture (driven by a medical biologist controlling ownership
instead of a financial investor) also helps us attract and retain high quality staff and serves as a competitive differentiator
in M&A processes.


-----

We will continue to enhance our internal logistical and procurement networks and aim to operate as efficiently as possible
in the delivery of our services. Our strategy is to use a limited number of suppliers per service and type of purchase for the
Group. This selection process allows us to choose the best supplier for each type of analysis and to obtain optimized
purchasing conditions through economies of scale. Our procurement partner framework agreements will be revisited from
time to time to ensure they continue bringing the best value for our Group as we continue to grow in scale, and our logistical
arrangements will respond to the increasing scope of our network to ensure that our operating and financial performance
is maintained.

We will continue our strategy of maximizing our operational efficiency, through our dense networks of collection sites
located in close proximity to technical platforms, which enable us to centralize our testing equipment and professionals at
technical platforms, reduce our overhead costs and, consequently, maintain our high EBITDA margin. Moreover, we will
maintain our focus on providing customers with convenience in terms of proximity to our collection sites, fast and accurate
testing results (we estimate that we revert with test results within 12 hours for a majority of tests) and flexible opening
hours. We will also continue to minimize our logistics costs through our hub-and-spoke model, which enables us to achieve
quick turnaround of testing results.

Although we anticipate our net sales to experience downward pressure in the near term as a result of regulatory pricing
pressure in our markets, we have a long track record and significant experience in managing pricing pressure and we remain
confident that our above-market organic volume growth trajectory and consistent operating cost control will continue to
mitigate this to deliver stable or near-stable EBITDA margins and free cash flow in the short to medium term. By leveraging
our dense network, strategically placed in metropolitan areas with higher demand for medical testing due to their
demographics, we expect to sustain sufficient volume growth with low staff costs, allowing us to resist against pricing
pressure in the future.

In line with our historical acquisitions, we will focus on adding scale without reducing post-synergy and cost savings
EBITDA margins for future acquisitions. We will aim to maintain a track record of meeting or exceeding forecast synergies
and cost savings with our future acquisitions, by implementing agile integration strategies and adopting efficiency measures
between the first day of integration and within a few weeks from closing.

**_Encourage the sharing of best practices internally to provide the highest quality service_**

As one of the market-leading providers of testing services, we have developed a reputation for operational excellence. One
of our key differentiators is that our ownership and management structure fosters our culture as a scientifically-led
organization that promotes the sharing of best practices within our Group. Our corporate infrastructure provides the
necessary framework for sharing best practices across our network, through “best practice” committees organized by topic
and supervised by our Quality department, to ensure such practices are benchmarked and adopted across our network. In
so doing, we aim to uniformly promote new investments in technologies and logistical innovation.

We constantly monitor and aim to improve our systems and processes, and plan to develop and upgrade our operating and
diagnostic systems to maintain high quality standards and deliver increased operational excellence and efficiency. For
example, we are actively exploring how increased automation can be incorporated into the end-to-end testing process and,
through our “best practice” committees, we plan to establish, benchmark and then implement new operating standards for
roll-out across our Group. These committees are also expected to build on the experience, including in crisis management
and operational optimization, we gained during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that we are best prepared
to respond to other potential challenges in the future. For example, we have benefited from sharing knowledge through
these committees on the best performing PCR testing equipment, as well as brand selection and alternative sourcing options
for reagents, masks and swabs, which has enhanced our ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and other future
pandemics or similar crises.

**The Transactions**

We intend to use the proceeds of this Offering, together with the proceeds from the Term Loan Facility and cash on balance
sheet to (i) repay in full the Existing Second Lien Debt, the Existing PIK Notes and the Existing Term Loan Facilities (the
“Refinancing”) and (ii) pay fees and expenses related to the issuance of the Notes and the Refinancing as well as accrued


-----

and unpaid interest and premiums related to the prepayment of the Existing Senior Facilities, Existing Second Lien Debt
and Existing PIK Notes. We do not expect to draw the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date.

The “Transactions” as used herein, shall comprise the following: (i) the Offering; (ii) the incurrence of indebtedness under
the Senior Facilities Agreement; and (iii) the Refinancing. See “Use of Proceeds”, “Capitalization”, “Description of Other
_Indebtedness”, “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes”._

**Recent Acquisitions**

In the first half of 2020, we secured a leading position in Auvergne Rhône-Alpes in France with the acquisition of
Dyomedea (the “Dyomedea Acquisition”) and in West of France (“Centre and Grand Ouest”, including Pays de la
Loire, Centre Val de Loire and Bretagne) with the acquisition of Reseau Bio, Sèvre Biologie, Biomélis and Laborizon (the
“Laborizon Acquisition”), a network of private medical analysis laboratories based in Grand Ouest (Western France).
These investments were in part financed by CDPQ, one of our investors.

On October 30, 2020, we acquired eight companies of Medina Group (“Medina Acquisition”), which is the leading
laboratory operator in Belgium in terms of net sales, to expand our operations to the Belgian medical lab testing market.
The Medina Acquisition was in part financed by ICG, one of our investors, through an equity contribution. In addition,
Straco, which previously owned the Medina Group, has since become one of our investors by reinvesting part of the
proceeds from the Medina Acquisition in our Group.

See “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information” for our combined results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2019 and nine months ended September 1, 2020, which present our results of operations as if the Laborizon
Acquisition and Medina Acquisition had occurred on the first day of the relevant period described. See “Principal
_Shareholders, Investors and Related Party Transactions” for more information on our investors._

On December 11, 2020, we signed a letter of intent to acquire two medical laboratory companies in France (the “Merle
**Acquisition”). We currently expect the Merle Acquisition to be completed by June 2021. The Merle Acquisition will be**
subject to standard closing conditions and due diligence and no assurances can be made that the acquisition will close.

**Other Recent Developments**

**_Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic_**

As a leading provider of medical laboratory testing, we believe we provide a vital service to the healthcare systems and
general public in France and Belgium during the COVID-19 pandemic to help fight against the virus.

We are working closely with French and Belgian government health authorities to use our PCR and serology testing
capabilities to help combat the virus. We have been granted the status of critical national infrastructure in France and
Belgium by their respective governments, which allows all of our key collection sites and technical platforms to remain
open and operational in order for us to meet the demand for our services during the lock-down periods.

The significant additional net sales from the large volume of PCR and serology tests we have performed since March 2020
in France and Belgium has resulted in strong cash generation and our increased ability to deleverage. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2020, we generated €184.6 million of pro forma net sales from COVID-19-related PCR and serology
tests, accounting for 21.4% of the Group’s pro forma net sales for the same period. This increase in our pro forma net sales
more than offset the decline of 4.7% in our pro forma net sales from our regular medical testing operations in France and
Belgium due to the government-mandated lockdowns and decrease in patients’ demand for routine testing as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. This also had a positive impact on our EBITDA, with our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 at €454.4 million and 35.1%,
respectively, compared to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
(excluding COVID-19 impact) margin of €386.2 million and 33.4% for the same period.


-----

In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we have exceeded our 2020 budget for PCR tests forecasted in March 2020 from 2.5
million tests to 6.4 million tests performed. See “Summary—Other Financial Data” for more information.

We believe that, in the short term, market growth in COVID-19-related tests will significantly counterbalance the negative
impact of the temporary decrease in volumes of other routine testing. The French and Belgian private medical lab testing
industry has proven its resilience, and we are currently seeing a gradual return to normal levels of activity in the routine
testing market. We are optimistic that, in the medium to long term, the easing of population confinement measures and the
return of normal economic activity in France and Belgium will result in our business fully returning to its normal levels.
Moreover, the Current Triennial Plan by the French government for the period between 2020 through 2022 provides some
market growth and earnings visibility until December 2022. In Belgium, we expect the government budget allocated to
clinical biology medical testing expenditures will increase as a result of an increase in the Fixed Sum of the medical test
price by 1% and an increase in the variable portion of the medical test price calculated with B-Value by 0.8% in 2021
compared to those budgets for 2020. The exact allocation between the private medical laboratory testing market and the
public market to be published and implemented at a later date. See “Industry” for more information on Fixed Sum and BValue.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, it is not possible to accurately predict the near-, medium- or long-term impact
of COVID-19 on our business and our industry, the timing and the extent, if any, of the changes in policies on
reimbursement of COVID-19 tests and government policies in connection with the testing requirements for employees for
COVID-19, and the availability of a vaccine against COVID-19 in France and Belgium remain uncertain. See “Risks
_Related to Our Industry—The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has caused severe disruptions in_
_the global economy and financial markets which could adversely affect our business”. We will continue monitoring and_
working closely with the authorities as necessary as the COVID-19 pandemic develops. See “Business – Impact of the
_COVID-19 Pandemic” for our PCR and serology testing capabilities, related reimbursement policies in France and Belgium_
and our other COVID-19 pandemic-related initiatives.

**_Our operations in the United Kingdom_**

In December 2020, we launched PCR test services in the United Kingdom through Biogroup Laboratory Limited, a nonwholly owned subsidiary of CAB incorporated in November 2020. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we operate
our operations in the United Kingdom through five collection sites and one technical platform, all located in London. As
of the date of this offering memorandum, we have testing capacity of 100,000 PCR tests per week in the United Kingdom,
and have conducted approximately 1,000 PCR tests per day.

**Current Trading**

Based on our preliminary results, our pro forma net sales from organic growth for the three months ended December 31,
2020 increased compared to the three months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the increase in PCR testing
volume to the COVID-19 pandemic which was partially offset by local lockdown and restrictions imposed by the French
and Belgian governments.

Based on our preliminary results, our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2020
increased compared to the three months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the increase in PCR testing volume to
the COVID-19 pandemic and implementation of synergies with respect to our recent acquisitions.

Based on our preliminary results, our net sales for the ten months ended October 31, 2020 increased to €900.2 million from
€490.1 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2019, primarily due to the impact of our recent acquisitions and the
increase in PCR testing volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was partially offset by local lockdown and
restrictions imposed by the French and Belgian governments. Our pro forma net sales for the ten months ended October
31, 2020 was €1,086.0 million.

Based on our preliminary results, our EBITDA for the ten months ended October 31, 2020 increased to €339.3 million
from €149.2 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2019, primarily due to the impact of our recent acquisitions and
the increase in PCR testing volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic and implementation of synergies with respect to our


-----

recent acquisitions. Our EBITDA margin for the ten months ended October 31, 2020 increased to 37.7% from 30.4% for
the ten months ended October 31, 2019 primarily due to the increase in PCR testing volumes due to the COVID-19
pandemic. Our pro forma EBITDA and pro forma EBITDA margin were €378.7 milion and 34.9%, respectively, for the
ten months ended October 31, 2020.

Based on our preliminary results, our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 was €327 million, which increased
by €121 million from €205.9 million as of September 30, 2020.

_The preliminary results presented above have not been audited, are derived from internal management accounts, are the_
_responsibility of management and are subject to our financial closing prcedures. These procedures have not yet been_
_completed. While we believe these preliminary results to be reasonable, our actual results could vary and these differences_
_could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this information. In particular, results for the ten_
_months ended October 31, 2020 may not be indicative of the remainder of the quarter ended December 31, 2020 or any_
_future periods. See “Forward-Looking Statements”, “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_

In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less
than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding
relevant Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such
tender offer and the relevant Issuer, or any third party making such a tender
offer in lieu of the relevant Issuer, purchases all of the relevant Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the relevant Issuer or
such third party will have the right to redeem the relevant Notes that remain
outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price
equal to the price offered to each other holder of such Notes. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption—
_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers” and “Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Optional Redemption—Optional Redemption upon Certain_
_Tender Offers”._

In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the relevant Issuer

redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.

relevant Notes at a purchase price in cash of 101% of the principal amount
thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase.
However, a change of control with respect to the relevant Notes will not
be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio
is not exceeded in connection with such event. See “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Senior_
_Notes—Change of Control”._

the Indentures. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID19 impact) for informational purposes only. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the
acquisitions or other transactions for which an adjustment is made occurred at the dates indicated. There is no assurance that items we have
identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The calculations
for Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) are based on various
assumptions (including the successful implementation of certain initiatives), management estimates and the unaudited management accounts
of the acquired businesses. These amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent
accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the
financial condition or results of operations of the acquired businesses or other transactions for the periods presented, may not be comparable
to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied
upon when making an investment decision. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability
to service our debt. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19
impact) have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as
reported under French GAAP. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”.

(a) Represents the reversal of provisions for doubtful accounts, which are non-cash items that we consider similar to depreciation and amortization.

(b) Represents the non-utilization fee for the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, which we believe to be a non-recurring finance cost. The fee was
recorded as operating income in accordance with French GAAP, but has been reclassified as it is related to our financing costs.

(c) Represents remaining transactional costs associated with certain acquisitions (such as advisory and legal fees), which we believe to be nonrecurring costs that should have been categorized as non-recurring costs in connection with the acquisitions we have made in 2017, 2018 and
2019, respectively. See “Business—Our History” for more information on major acquisitions we have completed during the respective periods.

(d) Represents a reduction in net sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 due to a temporary reduction of 7.4% imposed by the French social
security office in the prices for substantially all of the clinical tests we performed in France from November 2018. This temporary price
reduction was reversed in December 2018. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The prices we may charge in our markets are
_dependent on prices set by governments. Efforts to reduce government spending on healthcare and diagnostic testing may adversely affect_
_our business.”_

(e) Represents research and development (R&D) tax credit recorded as a reduction of tax expense in accordance with French GAAP, which has
been reclassified.
(f) Represents tax costs incurred in connection with French value added business tax (CVAE (cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des entreprises)),
which would have been classified as an income tax under IFRS.

(g) Represents the additional EBITDA that would have been recognized had Santé Labo been fully consolidated in 2017. We acquired additional
shares in Santé Labo during the year ended December 31, 2018, and as a result have fully consolidated Santé Labo in our consolidated financial
statements. Prior to this date, we only partially consolidated Santé Labo using the equity method.

(h) Represents change in subcontractor rebates granted, which is applied retroactively to our historical perimeter excluding change in
subcontractor rebates in connection with the Laborizon and Medina acquisitions.

(i) Represents deconsolidation of operations of CBM25 from our consolidated financial statements. As of December 1, 2020, we no longer
exercise de facto control over CBM25 and will therefore deconsolidate the operations of CBM25 from our consolidated financial statements.
The consideration paid for the acquisition of CBM25 will be recorded as a claim against the CBM25 Sellers on our consolidated balance sheet
going forward. See “Business—Legal Proceedings” for more information.

(j) Represents the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of the companies that we acquired between October 1, 2019 and the date of this offering
memorandum on an annual run-rate basis, including (for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020):

(i) the €12.1 million run rate EBITDA contribution of Dyomedea in connection with the Dyomedea Acquisition;

(ii) the € 27.7 million run rate EBITDA contribution of Laborizon in connection with the Laborizon Acquisition;

(iii) the €73.5 million run rate EBITDA contribution of Medina Group in connection with the Medina Acquisition; and

(iv) the €3.1 million run rate EBITDA contribution of other companies acquired by us during the period, including acquisitions of
Biomélis, Réseau Bio, Sèvre Biologie, LABM du Valois, Port Marly and RS Bio (collectively, the “Other 2020 Acquisitions”).

(k) Represents cost savings and synergies and general efficiency improvements, each on an annual run-rate basis, that have not been implemented
as of September 30, 2020, including:


-----

(i) in connection with the Dyomedea Acquisition, non-recurring expenses relating to the restatement and streamlining of processes
and overhead reductions, including as a result of purchasing efficiencies, streamlining of processes by integrating acquired
businesses into our hub-and-spoke technical platforms and overhead reductions, changes in biologist remuneration, management
fees, savings on reagent supplies expenses;

(ii) in connection with the Laborizon Acquisition, non-recurring expenses relating to the restatement, streamlining of processes by
integrating acquired businesses into our hub-and-spoke technical platforms, staff departure and overhead reductions and impacts
of new or loss of clinical contract, including as a result of purchasing efficiencies, changes in biologist remuneration, biologists
retirements and departures, savings on reagent supplies expenses, a discount rate on subcontracted specialized testing and
reinsourcing of part of the previously subcontracted specialized testing in-house;

(iii) in connection with the Medina Acquisition, non-recurring expenses relating to the restatement and streamlining of processes and
overhead reductions, including as a result of purchasing efficiencies, streamlining of processes by integrating acquired businesses
into our hub-and-spoke technical platforms and overhead reduction, changes in biologist remuneration, management fees, savings
on reagent supplies expenses; and

(iv) in connection with the Other 2020 Acquisitions, non-recurring expenses relating to the restatement, streamlining of processes by
integrating acquired businesses into our hub-and-spoke technical platforms, staff departures and overhead reductions and impacts
of new or terminated clinical contracts, including as a result of purchasing efficiencies, streamlining of processes by integrating
acquired businesses into our hub-and-spoke technical platforms and overhead reductions, changes in biologist remuneration,
savings on reagent supplies expenses, a discount rate on subcontracted specialized testing and reinsourcing of part of previously
subcontracted specialized testing in-house.

(l) The presentation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) is for informational
purposes only. The calculations for Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) are based
on various assumptions and management estimates. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the
acquisitions for which an adjustment is made occurred and been fully integrated on January 1, 2020. The EBITDA of each of the relevant
acquired companies for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 may not be representative of what the EBITDA of such entities would
have been for the period, as the case may be, had the acquisitions for which an adjustment is made occurred and been fully integrated on
January 1, 2020. In addition, the estimated cost savings and synergies reflected in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) are based on various assumptions and management estimates and are presented on an annual runrate basis as if such cost savings and synergies had been fully realized at the beginning of the relevant period. We may not be able to achieve
these cost savings and synergies in a timely manner or at all. The estimated cost savings and synergies are based on a number of assumptions
made in reliance on the information available to us and management's judgements based on such information. The assumptions used in
estimating synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our estimates of cost savings and synergies. These
numbers have not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information is inherently
subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the
relevant acquired companies for periods prior to their acquisition, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other
financial information included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) are included in this offering memorandum because we
believe that they provide a useful measure of our results of operations; however, this information does not constitute a measure of financial
performance under French GAAP, and you should not consider Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding
COVID-19 impact) as alternatives to operating income/(loss) or any other performance measure derived in accordance with French GAAP or
as a measure of our results of operations or liquidity. Other companies, including those in our industry, may calculate a similarly titled financial
measure differently from us, and so the presentation of such financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of
other companies. Funds depicted by certain of these measures may not be available for management's discretionary use due to covenant
restrictions, debt service payments or other commitments.

(m) Represents the restatement of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our EBITDA, including (a) an adjustment to normalize EBITDA to
account for the negative impact on the operation of our collection sites during the first lockdown between March and May 2020 through
applying our EBITDA margin between January to February 2020 to our net sales realized by the group during the same period of 2019, and
(b) the exclusion of additional EBITDA generated by COVID-19-related testing activity, which we consider to be non-recurring.

(n) Represents the EBITDA generated by COVID-19-related testing activity that we deem recurring, such as COVID-19 tests required for
international travels, as will be permitted when calculating “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined under the Indentures.

(8) Adjusted EBITDA margin, expressed as a percentage, is calculated as (i) Adjusted EBITDA, divided by (ii) total net sales.

(9) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin, expressed as a percentage, is calculated as (i) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, divided by (ii) total pro
forma net sales.

(10) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) margin, expressed as a percentage, is calculated as (i) Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact), divided by (ii) total pro forma net sales.

(11) As adjusted interest expense represents our estimated interest expense on a pro forma basis for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020,
after giving effect to the Transactions and the Acquisitions as if they had occurred on September 30, 2020. This reflects the interest expense
in connection with debt incurred under our existing financial leases and other financial debt that is expected to remain outstanding on the Issue
Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes offered hereby and debt under the Term Loan Facility that will be outstanding after
giving effect to the Transactions. Our Revolving Credit Facility will not be drawn on the Issue Date and we have assumed for purposes of this
calculation that the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn through 2020. See “Use of Proceeds”.

As adjusted interest expense has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our interest expense
would have actually been had the Transactions and the Acquisitions occurred on September 30, 2020, nor does it purport to project our interest
expense for any future period or our financial position at any future date.

(12) As adjusted net financial debt represents the principal amount of our loans and borrowings including the principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Notes offered hereby after giving effect to the Transactions and the Acquisitions and the application of the
proceeds therefrom as if the Transactions and the Acquisitions occurred on September 30, 2020.

(13) As adjusted net senior secured financial debt represents the principal amount of our loans and borrowings including the principal amount of
the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby after giving effect to the Transactions and the Acquisitions and the application of the proceeds
therefrom as if the Transactions and the Acquisitions occurred on September 30, 2020.

**Risk Factors**

_An investment in the Notes involves risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding to invest_
_in the Notes. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information in this offering memorandum, including_
_the financial statements and related notes. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face._

_Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also_
_impair our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make payments on the Notes._

_This offering memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual_
_results may differ materially from those included in these forward- looking statements as a result of various factors,_
_including the risks described below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Industry**

**_The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has caused severe disruptions in the global economy and_**
**_financial markets which could adversely affect our business._**

In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was first detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World
Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and governmental authorities around the world have since
implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The global spread of COVID-19 and the various attempts to
contain it have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The extent to which the COVID-19 may
impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain. In an effort to halt the outbreak
of COVID-19, countries throughout the world, including the countries in which we operate, have placed significant
restrictions such as shelter in place or stay-at-home orders and many businesses have announced extended closures. Such
jurisdictions may continue to impose prolonged quarantines, which could significantly impact our ability to support our
operations and customers.

While our key collection sites and technical platforms have remained open and operational, and the increase in demand for
COVID-19-related PCR and serology testing has offset the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business
and results of operations, we experienced:

� a significant decrease in volumes of non-critical medical testing during the initial lockdown in France and
Belgium,

� an increase in absenteeism of employees in patient-facing activities during the initial lockdown in France between
March and May 2020,

� the need for recruitment of nurses and non-biologists on temporary contracts to meet the French population’s
needs for COVID-19 tests,

� an increase in our orders of reagents, and

� an increase in capital expenditures related to dedicated COVID-19 diagnostics equipment and other supplies such
as gloves, swabs and masks.

Furthermore, although the high demand for COVID-19 diagnostic services has had a net positive effect on our financial
condition and represents a significant part of our net sales in 2020, we cannot guarantee that such demand will continue in
the medium- to long-term. On December 2, 2020, the United Kingdom became the first country in the world to approve
the widespread use of a COVID-19 vaccine. As COVID-19 vaccines become more effective and widely used over the next
one-to-two years, it is likely that the COVID-19 diagnostic services market will see a significant decrease. Any such
decrease could significantly reduce our revenue with respect to COVID-19-related testing.


-----

Our business continuity could be adversely affected in the event that our employees are affected in significant numbers by
the pandemic. In addition, operations at our labs could be interrupted if our suppliers become unable to deliver necessary
personal protective equipment, reagents or other supplies on time in the required quality. The pandemic could adversely
impact our future ability to access debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, due to the disruption and instability
in the global financial markets or deterioration in credit and financing conditions, which could affect our ability to meet
liquidity requirements.

The rapid development of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate impact of COVID-19. The duration and
extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at
this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus and the extent and effectiveness of containment actions.
The disruptions caused by the pandemic, including any renewed or sustained lockdowns mandated by the government,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
While the French and Belgian governments have reimbursed the testing services provider the costs of PCR tests in full in
the past, their reimbursement policies have since been updated to require certain conditions to be met to qualify for full
reimbursement, and their reimbursement policies may further change from time to time. For example, as of December 15,
2020, PCR testing services providers in France would be reimbursed by the government for €54.00 for the PCR test, plus
€9.60 for the collection by medical staff, €4.59 for the pre-analytical package including anti-COVID-19 protection for all
staff and €5.40 for the national information database (in total, €73.59 per test) only if the test results are provided within
12 hours from testing. If test results are provided between 12 and 24 hours after testing, testing service providers would be
reimbursed for €43.20 per test; between 24 and 48 hours, €31 per test; and after 48 hours, €0 per test. Moreover, the Belgian
government announced in October 2020 that reimbursement may only be made for patients with prescriptions, which has
and may continue to significantly reduce the number of tests per week in the country. Any further changes in the policies
or related developments that may reduce the demand or volume of COVID-19-related tests could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Furthermore, the budget deficit
caused by COVID-19 spending could place extra pressure on medical lab testing related budget in France, Belgium or any
other markets in which we may operate in the future, which could place further pressure on testing prices and reduce the
level of reimbursement by the government entities. This may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash
flows and prospects. See “Summary—Other Recent Developments—Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.” Because the
COVID-19 situation is unprecedented and continuously evolving, the other potential impacts to our risk factors that are
further described below are uncertain.

**_We operate in a highly regulated sector. Compliance with regulations applicable to our activities may increase our costs_**
**_or restrict our activities. Failure to comply with such regulations may lead to penalties of various types. Future_**
**_alterations to regulations applicable to us may have a material adverse impact on our activities._**

The medical diagnostics industry (including medical laboratory testing) is subject to extensive regulations and controls by
various regulatory authorities in France and Belgium. These regulations and controls have a significant influence on the
way we carry out our activities. For medical laboratories, these regulations mainly pertain to professional qualifications of
laboratory personnel, ownership and corporate governance constraints on companies that operate laboratories (which are
especially strict in France) and the pricing and reimbursement levels for medical tests. Our activities are also subject to
numerous other laws and regulations, particularly with respect to the handling and storage of certain chemicals and
reagents, the disposal of biological waste (waste from care activities that carry a risk of infection), the handling and storage
of personal data (including patients’ medical records and test results), relationships with doctors and hospitals (including
laws and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and regulating gifts and fringe benefits) and the prevention of fraud on social
security systems. Our compliance with such regulations is monitored by the relevant administrative authorities in the
countries and regions in which we operate, as well as by the competent professional associations.

Compliance with current or future laws and regulations may cause an increase in our administrative, legal and operational
expenditure, force us to alter our commercial practices, our legal organization, the ownership structure and corporate
governance of our subsidiaries or, more generally, reduce or limit our net sales. Such laws and regulations have a broad
scope of application and their interpretation by the competent administrative authorities or professional associations is
subject to change. Potential efforts to comply with existing laws and regulations, new interpretations of such laws and
regulations or new laws and regulations may generate substantial additional costs for us. Failure to comply with such


-----

regulations may also lead to sanctions of various kinds for us and potentially for medical biologists working for us.
Sanctions may be administrative (fines, periodic penalty payments, temporary or permanent closures of laboratories),
disciplinary (temporary or permanent removal of the right to practice), civil (damages) or criminal (a ban on operating a
medical laboratory or imprisonment).

In addition, changes affecting certain regulations or government programs that are not directly connected with the medical
diagnostics sector, and in particular regulations relating to prescription control, co-payment, doctors, health insurers and
hospitals, may also affect us and impair our results of operations and our ability to expand our activities.

In general, if we fail to comply with applicable regulations, if they change or are interpreted in a manner adverse to us or
if we cannot maintain, renew or secure required permits, licenses, accreditations, agreements or other necessary
administrative authorizations, we may be unable to pursue our activities or market our services, be excluded from
participating in public healthcare programs, no longer be able to enter into contracts with third-party payers, suffer penalties
or civil and criminal fines, or be subject to complaints by third parties, with the financial consequences that may result
under any of the foregoing scenarios. Although we could develop a strategy to anticipate such regulatory changes, our
industry and operating environment may not respond to those changes in the way we expect, and we may, as a result, be
unable to maintain our position in those markets or apply our strategy in such markets. In addition, our competitors may,
in the future, gain greater financial resources or stronger market positions than ours and may be able to better respond to
future regulatory reforms. If we cannot respond effectively to regulatory and market changes, our outlook and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

These laws and regulations, the extent of some of which have not been fully interpreted by courts, may require us to modify
our operations or impose additional compliance expenses or burdens or give rise to administrative fines and penalties. For
example, recent French regulatory reforms have imposed stricter International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”)
operating standards (namely ISO 15189), and introduced minimum accreditation standards for laboratories, with which we
will need to comply by 2021, the implementation of which has been and is expected to continue to be costly and time
consuming. The laboratory accreditation process involves the preparation of written applications, site studies and
assessment of the scope of changes required to comply with new standards, the appointment of external qualified experts,
the training of our staff, the participation of our staff in the process in addition to their usual workload, the payment of
certain administrative fees and the implementation of new quality software.

Accreditation may be delayed based on many factors, including the number of sites operated by a medical laboratory and
the responsiveness of the accreditation body, COFRAC (Comité français d’accréditation), which has been negatively
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have already undertaken to conduct our business in compliance with
these heightened standards, any further changes in laws and regulations may require us to further modify our operations.
In Belgium, accreditation under the ISO 15189 standard has become a condition for the reimbursement of laboratory tests
performed on the DNA of microorganisms (such as viruses) pursuant to the Royal Decree of March 19, 2008, modifying
the annex of the Royal Decree of September 14, 1984, establishing the list of healthcare services eligible for reimbursement
by public health insurance. According to the Royal Decree of January 31, 2006, BELAC (Organisme belge
_d’Accréditation) is the only public body authorized to give such accreditation. However, accreditation under BELAC does_
not otherwise affect reimbursement and is not necessary for the majority of medical tests. As of August 2020,
approximately 93% of Biogroup’s laboratories and facilities in France were accredited. All but one of our collection sites
in Belgium have obtained the BELAC accreditation in line with the ISO 15189 standard.

As discussed below, French law imposes stringent restrictions on the legal structure and ownership of medical laboratories.
See “Risks Related to Our Business—We may not exercise full control over the operations of our French subsidiaries in
_which we have a minority voting interest, including the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and are dependent on the biologists_
_who own a majority voting interest in them to conduct the operations of such subsidiaries.”_

Moreover, all arrangements between shareholders of our laboratory companies that are not contained in the bylaws could
become unenforceable if they are not communicated to the relevant professional association. Article L. 6223-8 III of the
French Public Health Code provides that, in order to be enforceable, all arrangements relating to a laboratory company
(including shareholder agreements) must be communicated to the relevant professional association (Ordre national des


-----

_pharmaciens and/or Ordre national des médecins). Failing to do so, the shareholding agreements pertaining to our_
laboratory companies could become unenforceable.

In addition, we are subject to specific Belgian regulations relating to the operation of the medical laboratory business. In
particular, the Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 (implementing Article 3 §1(2) of the Royal Decree n° 143 of December 30,
1982) lists the four legal forms that medical laboratory companies may take in order to be eligible for reimbursement by
the Belgian public health insurance system. The duration of this Royal Decree, which was initially due to expire on
December 31, 2009, has been extended retroactively until December 31, 2012, by a Royal Decree of January 27, 2010. The
regulatory authorities have confirmed that to date, no new Royal Decree has been adopted. As the term of the Royal Decree
of April 26, 2007 has expired, and to date no new royal decree has been adopted, there is currently no legal framework
regulating the legal forms that medical laboratory companies should take in order to be eligible for reimbursement by the
Belgian public health insurance system. See “Regulation—Belgium.” It is currently unclear whether a new Decree will be
adopted and, if so, what its content will be. The absence of any form of extension of the duration of the Royal Decree of
April 26, 2007 could have a significant impact on all Belgian laboratories run under the same corporate form as ours,
including us.

In the event of our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, our reputation could be damaged and important
relationships with government regulators or third parties could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_The prices we may charge in our markets are dependent on prices set by governments. Efforts to reduce government_**
**_spending on healthcare and diagnostic testing may adversely affect our business._**

In France and Belgium, most of our activities are highly regulated. In particular, there are mandatory prices or pricing
methodologies for a large majority of the medical tests we perform. Prices are established by governments and we have
limited, or no, influence over the levels at which they are set. Revisions of prices may occur on a regular basis. Overall
price decreases, or the implementation of a pricing formula that fails to keep up with testing costs, may reduce our margins
and may affect our net sales from testing services, our operating results or the economic feasibility of providing certain
testing services by some or all of our collection sites and technical platforms.

We are particularly sensitive to prices in France, as the majority of our business is located in France, which represented
86.5% of our pro forma net sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. In the French private medical laboratory
test market, tests are state-regulated and prices and reimbursement tariffs are set by the Ministry of Health and the national
healthcare regulatory body, CNAM, and are revised at least on an annual basis. Most recently, the CNAM entered into the
Current Triennial Plan in March 2020, under which the annual budget growth for medical lab tests is set for three years,
and allows an increase of up to 0.40% in 2020, 0.50% in 2021 and 0.60% in 2022. Based on the size of the private lab
market in the industry report and the proportion of spending in the French private medical testing market according to “Les
_dépenses de santé en 2019 —Résultats des comptes de la santé,” a report published in 2020 by Panorama de La Drees_
Santé, approximately 70.7% (or €3.3 billion) of spending in the French private medical testing market was financed by the
French social security system and the remainder was covered by private insurance companies (approximately 23.8%, or
€1.1 billion) and by the patient directly out-of-pocket (approximately 5.5%, or €0.3 billion) in 2019. See “Industry—
_Medical Laboratory Testing”, “Industry—France” and “Regulation—France” for more information. Although the_
percentage of spending financed by the social security system has remained relatively constant over time, the regulatory
prices in the French lab market have declined by approximately 1.5% during the period from 2014 to 2019, according to
the industry report. We cannot be certain of the extent of any future stagnation or reductions in prices that do not keep up
with the respective testing costs. Based on Les dépenses de santé en 2019 —Résultats des comptes de la santé by Panorama
de La Drees Santé, the French government has targeted annual savings in French healthcare expenditures of approximately
€1 billion in 2021. Both public and private medical testing expenditures represented approximately 5.5% of overall French
healthcare expenditures in 2019.

Since our acquisition of Medina Group, a Belgian laboratory testing company conducting routine laboratory testing in
Belgium, in October 2020, we are now also exposed to pricing decisions by regulators in Belgium. In the Belgian private
medical laboratory test market, tests are also state-regulated and in practice prices and reimbursement tariffs are set by the
Belgian government and national healthcare regulatory body, RIZIV/INAMI, and are revised at least on an annual basis.


-----

According to the RIZIV/INAMI, the Belgian social security system reimburses between 70% and 100% of regulated
medical test expenditures, while the patient contribution ranges from 0% to 30%. Currently, the Belgian pricing system
includes a “claw back” mechanism that allows the Belgian government to recover budgetary overspend. See “Regulation—
_Belgium.” According to the industry report, historical prices of routine tests in the private medical laboratory testing market_
in Belgium have increased by approximately 1% per annum since 2010, with national social welfare agency contributions
roughly tracking inflation and patient contribution levels remaining stable. There can be no guarantee that prices will
continue in line with this trend, particularly given that the Belgian national social welfare agency intends to change its
medical reimbursement scheme, which could include a price reduction affecting the medical laboratory testing market, due
to a high and increasing social security deficit.

Due to the high levels of government spending required to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a possibility that
government health insurance schemes may be curtailed or otherwise restricted due to budgetary pressures in the long term.
Although the French and Belgian governments have provided, and are expected to provide in the future, additional budgets
for healthcare costs related to external shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, there cannot be any assurance that such
additional budgets will continue to be made available on the same terms or at all. As a general matter, future reductions in
government health insurance coverage, including in the wake of high levels of spending in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic, could put downward pressure on regulatory pricing for medical tests, thus adversely affecting our results of
operations and financial condition. Furthermore, because of the importance of the French market to our business, we are
specifically exposed to budgetary pressures in France and further price reductions in France could significantly adversely
affect our overall performance. For more detail on French prices for laboratory tests, see ““Industry—Medical Laboratory
_Testing,” and “Industry—France.”_

We expect increased constraints on government regulated prices to continue in both France and Belgium. Both France and
Belgium have in the past, and may in the future, pursue expenditure control measures aimed at curbing spending, including
healthcare expenditures. In particular, governments tend to reduce price levels in greater proportion on tests that are
administered in high volumes, which has a multiplying effect on our results as the tests we perform in high volumes tend
to be impacted by larger price cuts. In addition, any changes in government or in the political environment in the countries
in which we operate may cause future regulatory changes in the healthcare industry, which could have a negative impact
on our business. For example, policies that constrain consolidation in markets in which we operate, limit or decrease the
amounts we may charge for our services or exclude coverage of certain of our services from public health programs may
have a material adverse effect on our net sales and operating results.

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_We may not exercise full control over the operations of our French subsidiaries in which we have a minority voting_**
**_interest, including the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and are dependent on the biologists who own a majority voting_**
**_interest in them to conduct the operations of such subsidiaries._**

French law sets regulatory constraints on the corporate structure and nature of ownership of the share capital of medical
laboratories. In particular, French law limits (i) persons who are not medical biologists and entities that are not laboratory
companies from holding more than 25% of a laboratory company’s share capital and (ii) external medical biologists and
entities that are laboratory companies from holding more than 49.9% of the voting rights and, subject to certain exceptions,
of the share capital in a laboratory company. French law also requires that medical laboratories must take the corporate
form of a SEL or SELAS (unless they are organized as a non-profit organization, or a _société civile professionnelle_
(“SCP”), or a cooperative undertaking). See “Regulation—France.”

We primarily conduct our business through our subsidiaries in France and Belgium, which we own and operate through
CAB, which is incorporated as a SELAS under French law. Our founder, Stéphane Eimer, a medical biologist, directly and
indirectly holds a majority of the voting rights of Laboratoire Eimer, the remainder being held by medical biologists.
Laboratoire Eimer owns 99.99% of the share capital, 49.63% of the voting rights and 99.99% of the financial rights in
CAB, with the remainder being held by in-house medical biologists and other minority shareholders.

Due to the limitation under French law described above, CAB, which holds our French and Belgian laboratory subsidiaries,
holds between approximately 37.30% to 49.57% of the voting rights in our French laboratory subsidiaries, with biologists


-----

operating such French laboratory subsidiaries holding the majority of the voting rights. The bylaws of such French
laboratory subsidiaries allow CAB to hold approximately between 50% and 99% of the financial rights (e.g. rights to
receive dividend payments) in its French laboratory subsidiaries. See “Business—Our Corporate Structure (SEL/SELAS)”
for more information on our structure.

Certain of the shareholders of our French laboratory subsidiaries have entered into shareholders’ agreements or similar
agreements with the biologists working in the relevant French laboratory subsidiary. Certain of these agreements allow the
representatives of the shareholders to hold positions at the managing bodies of such French laboratory subsidiary, but such
managing bodies do not have control over any managerial decisions at the laboratory subsidiary and consultive in nature.

In addition, the obligations and constraints resulting from such agreements are limited by French regulatory constraints
regarding the independence of biologists. The legal representatives of a French laboratory subsidiary company must be
medical biologists working within such laboratory company, and are appointed by decision of the shareholders of the
laboratory company, the majority of which are medical biologists. As a result, we are dependent on the biologists who hold
the majority of the voting rights in our French subsidiaries for decisions affecting these subsidiaries’ day to day routine
operations. Although we exercise de facto control over our French laboratory subsidiaries through CAB, the biologists who
hold the majority of the voting rights in our French laboratory subsidiaries may not necessarily share our views on the
manner in which the subsidiaries should be managed and may exercise their voting rights in a manner adverse to us. This
could disrupt the operations of our French laboratories and divert our management’s time and attention from the operation
of our business. If our business activities were disrupted due to a conflict with our biologists, our operating results could
be negatively affected.

In addition, under the terms of the articles of associations, bylaws and shareholders’ agreements of certain of our French
laboratory subsidiaries, as the case may be, we may be required to purchase shares held by the medical biologist
shareholders upon their retirement or for other reasons. We are permitted to, as shareholders of our laboratory subsidiaries,
substitute a medical biologist shareholder for another medical biologist shareholder under the relevant articles of
associations, bylaws and shareholders’ agreements, as the case may be. If the leaving medical biologists are not replaced
in a timely manner, it may result in our holding a greater percentage of the share capital and voting rights in such French
laboratory subsidiaries than is permitted by French law. Although there is a one-year grace period (and, if an interested
person brings a legal action against the relevant laboratory company, an additional six-months grace period to remedy the
situation may be granted) in the law to reduce holdings back down to the maximum permitted level, if we fail to reduce
our holdings within such period in compliance with the relevant French law, we may be required to dissolve or wind up
such subsidiary. Furthermore, the grace period does not technically apply to the validity of the licenses of such subsidiaries
and, as such, if we surpass the maximum ownership threshold for share capital and voting rights, even during the one-year
grace period, the licenses of such subsidiaries could be subject to revocation, although our licenses have never been subject
to such revocation under these conditions.

Although we typically seek to align the shareholders’ agreements of our newly acquired French laboratory subsidiaries
with those of our existing subsidiaries, because the consent of the biologists is required for such alignment, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.

Moreover, our institutional investors hold bonds convertible or redeemable into preferred shares of Holdco. Upon
conversion or redemption of such bonds in part or in whole, our current shareholders’ shareholding in Holdco, and therefore
in Laboratoire Eimer, may be significantly diluted. See “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure” for more
information.

We are subject to ongoing legal proceedings, the result of which may require us to amend the existing ownership and legal
structure of our French operations and to implement a new structure for any future acquisitions. On December 14, 2020,
Cerba Selafa, Cefid and Cerba Healthcare (the “Cerba Group”) initiated legal proceedings against, among others,
Laborizon, CAB and Laborizon Centre (the “Cerba Litigation”). In March 2017, certain trade unions brought a lawsuit
against the Cerba Group seeking a judgment that would nullify or render inoperable certain provisions in the articles of
incorporation and shareholder agreements in certain of the Cerba Group’s subsidiaries that are subject to French legal
restrictions on the legal structure and ownership of medical laboratories (the “March 2017 Litigation”). Pursuant to the
Cerba Litigation, the Cerba Group is seeking that any judgment in the March 2017 Litigation (if rendered in favor of such


-----

trade unions) be imposed on, among others, Laborizon, CAB and Laborizon Centre as well. Both the March 2017 Litigation
and the Cerba Litigation are ongoing, and it is possible that a judgment is rendered in favor of the trade unions under the
March 2017 Litigation and in favor of the Cerba Group under the Cerba Litigation, which would subject us to the March
2017 Litigation judgment, and any appeals against such judgments may prove unsuccessful. While the legal and practical
consequences of such judgments against Biogroup, our subsidiaries and the medical laboratory industry in which we
operate are currently unclear, we may be required to amend the existing ownership and legal structure of our French
operations and may not be able to continue using our existing acquisition strategy for future acquisitions in France. This
may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our growth through
acquisitions could be significantly limited. See “Business—Legal Proceedings” and “Regulation—France” for more
information.

**_We face risks associated with the acquisition of businesses in connection with our strategy._**

In the past we have made strategic acquisitions by acquiring laboratory testing groups in France and Belgium, such as
Dyomedea, Bioesterel, Medina, Unilians, and Laborizon and are looking for opportunities for future acquisitions. Our
growth strategy is to focus on smaller acquisitions of laboratories with one or more testing platforms, upgrade them to
equip them with the latest technology and increase their testing capacity, and utilize them as a regional centralized testing
platform for the additional collection sites that we acquire subsequently in the same geographic region, which generates
significant cost savings and optimization. We may also consider larger acquisitions in regions and segments of the market
in which we are already present in order to increase our market share, or in other new regions and segments of the market
in order to establish a foothold. For instance, in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we respectively
completed nine, eleven and sixteen acquisitions. As of November 2020, we have completed nine acquisitions during 2020.
In the regions in which we are already present, we plan to focus primarily on small- and mid-sized bolt-on acquisitions
going forward. Acquisitions in new regions are likely to focus on mid-sized to larger targets that we believe will provide
us with sufficient scale and both local collection sites and technical platforms. Any such acquisition could substantially
increase the amount of our outstanding debt.

The success of our acquisition strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, conduct
appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately agree and complete such transactions
and integrate the acquired business into our Group. Our plans to acquire additional businesses in the future are subject to
the availability of suitable opportunities at an attractive price and planned acquisitions may not materialize. The continued
consolidation of the French medical laboratory testing market, as well as the restrictions on both regional market share and
outsourcing, may limit the opportunities for acquisitions. Current laboratory ownership constraints in France have allowed
for the development of regional laboratory hubs that combine several smaller local laboratories into a larger regional entity.
However, French regulation still limits the proportion of tests that one person or entity may perform in a specified territory,
which limits our ability to pursue this strategy. Further, French tax reforms may limit biologists’ willingness to sell to a
potential buyer by imposing prohibitive capital gains tax rates. Furthermore, acquisitions of businesses with a turnover of
at least €40 million (consolidated at the target group or subgroup level) in Belgium may be subject to review by the Belgian
competition authority. Some of our competitors are following similar acquisition strategies and they, and certain financial
investors interested in entering our market, may have greater financial resources available for investments or may have
capacity to accept less favorable terms than we can accept, preventing us from acquiring the businesses that we target
and/or reducing the number of potential acquisition targets. In addition, certain of our competitors already have, or may
attain through acquisitions, a greater geographical footprint within a particular region or country making them a more
attractive acquirer for potential targets seeking to join a network, the size of which they believe will provide greater business
prospects.

We expand into new regions by targeting dynamic geographical areas or areas where we already enjoy a dense network,
thus allowing for a high level of synergies. Our acquisition strategy focuses on first acquiring a significant position in a
new territory and implementing synergies, then performing bolt-on acquisitions to densify, expand and optimize lab
networks. Generally, we acquire businesses based on a business plan which depends, in part, on anticipated synergies that
will materialize after the combination of the acquired business with our own. The success of our acquisition strategy hinges
upon the successful implementation of our business plans and realization of such synergies or cost savings within a
reasonable timeframe. Achieving synergies can be difficult and uncertain. Implementing a business plan, including


-----

achieving net sales targets in strategic international acquisitions, may not succeed on the targeted timeline or at all. We
anticipate the targeted synergies based on our due diligence of the target company (including its existing governance
structure) as well as standalone business models. Changes in either affect the timeframe in which we are able to realize
such synergies or our ability to realize them at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the customer
base or other contractual arrangement with third parties of businesses we acquire (in particular where they are subject to
change of control clauses), generate expected margins or cash flows, or realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions,
including growth or expected synergies, in the timeframe and at the costs we initially anticipate, if at all. Although we
analyze acquisition targets, those assessments are subject to assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates,
company valuations and ability to redeploy the workforce. There can be no assurance that our assessments of and
assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may significantly differ from
our expectations. In most cases, acquisitions involve the integration of a separate business that was previously operated
independently with different systems and processes.

Even if we are able to acquire new companies, unless we are able to integrate the companies we acquire in the future into
our own operations successfully, our ability to expand our operations and operate efficiently may weaken. We may not be
able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our business or such integration may require more investment or time than
we expect, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies with respect to customers,
employees, government authorities or public health programs, private health insurers, or to other parties, which may impact
our results of operations. Certain of the businesses we acquire may not have robust accounting systems, internal controls
and reporting systems, and as such the historical financial results of such businesses may be different from those reported
to us. Additionally, from time to time, disputes may arise with the sellers of businesses we acquire, some of whom may
continue to hold interests in the company or occupy management positions. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” Such
risks can be exacerbated in executing international acquisitions, as we may be less familiar with the competitive, operational
and regulatory environments in these markets and may not be able to identify suitable targets or be able to integrate them
successfully to achieve the desired synergies. The process of integrating businesses may be disruptive to our operations
and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such businesses or a decrease in our results of operations as a
result of difficulties or risks, including:

� unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual and other issues;

� loss of key customers or employees;

� delays in redeploying our workforce;

� difficulty in standardizing information and other systems;

� difficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure;

� difficulty in realizing operating synergies;

� failure to maintain the quality or timeliness of services that we have historically provided;

� added costs of dealing with such disruptions;

� regulatory and labor law restrictions on the redeployment or termination of employees;

� unforeseen challenges from operating in new geographic areas; and

� diversion of management’s attention from our day to day business as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing
disruptions and difficulties.

Furthermore, we may operate and acquire businesses in different countries, with different regulatory and operating cultures,
which may exacerbate the risks described above. If we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy or integrate
acquired businesses successfully, our business and our growth could be negatively affected.

For more details on the particular regulations that directly affect our business, see “Regulation.”

**_Failure to establish and comply with appropriate quality standards in the provision of our testing services could result_**
**_in litigation and liabilities and adversely impact our reputation._**

The tests we perform as part of our business are intended to supply healthcare professionals with information to help them
establish or support diagnoses and prescribe medication and treatment for patient care. Inaccuracies or negligence in
performing our testing services could lead to inaccurate drug efficacy and safety studies, incorrect diagnoses by doctors,
prescriptions of inappropriate treatment or decisions not to prescribe treatment when treatment is required, which may lead
to illness, harm, death, other adverse effects or liabilities. Errors such as misidentifying or inaccurately labeling samples,
compromising the integrity of samples and errors caused by testing machines or reagents may occur. Claims and litigation
against us may result in liability for the harm or other adverse effects caused. Payments related to such liabilities may
adversely affect our liquidity and financial position to the extent our existing insurance does not cover such liabilities and
may adversely affect our reputation. The process of defending such cases, even when we are successful in our defense, is
costly, could distract management from executing our strategy and could result in substantial damage to our reputation in
the medical community and with patients. To the extent we are held liable for misrepresentation or negligence, the damages
that we may owe could have a material negative financial impact on our business. Our competitors are also subject to
inaccuracies and negligence in their businesses, which may lead to illness, harm, death and other liabilities. To the extent
any such negligence results in litigation or an adverse outcome, we cannot guarantee that we will not be affected by any
resulting reputational harm to our competitors and to our industry more generally. Any such reputational harm could have
a material negative impact on our business and results of operations.

**_Continued weakness in economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses._**

Economic downturns may increase the risk associated with conducting our business. Economic difficulties tend to result
in reduced levels of activity and have led governments, private insurers and patients to reduce their expenditures on
healthcare, which has affected our net sales and margins.

Where patients, directly or indirectly (such as through private health insurance premiums), are responsible for all or part
of the cost of laboratory tests, individual decisions to reduce healthcare expenditures may result in a reduction of demand
for our services. Based on the size of the private lab market in the industry report and the proportion of spending in the
French private medical testing market according to “Les dépenses de santé en 2019 —Résultats des comptes de la santé,”
a report published in 2020 by Panorama de La Drees Santé, approximately 70.7% (or €3.3 billion) of spending in the French
private medical testing market was financed by the French social security system and the remainder was covered by private
insurance companies (approximately 23.8%, or €1.1 billion) and by the patient directly out-of-pocket (approximately 5.5%,
or €0.3 billion) in 2019. In Belgium, a patient’s out-of-pocket patient expenses amount up to 30% of the total price of
medical tests, on average, and generally act as a deterrent against overspending on medical testing. A decrease in household
disposable income, or the perception thereof, in times of economic downturn can lead to a reduction in individuals’
healthcare expenditure. This may result in patients postponing certain types of medical treatment and could result in a drop
in the volume of business we are able to conduct through our operations.

Governments, as direct payers of a test’s price, whether in part or in whole, have also instituted policies designed to reduce
their expenditures on healthcare as a means of reducing overall budget deficits. As a result of such policies, changes in
medical guidelines could occur, leading to lower volumes of recurring tests. Such changes could have a negative impact
on our business.

Future economic downturns may lead governments, public health authorities, private insurers and patients to further reduce
their expenditures on healthcare. Where patients are directly or indirectly responsible for all or part of the cost of laboratory
tests, individual decisions to reduce healthcare expenditures may result in a reduction in demand for our services. A
decrease in household disposable income, or the perception thereof, in times of economic downturn can lead to a reduction
in individuals’ healthcare expenditures. This may result in patients postponing certain types of medical treatment and could
result in a significant decrease in our volume of tests and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our pro forma consolidated financial information may not be representative of our results as a Group; additionally,_**
**_our actual financial condition and results of operations may differ materially._**

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information included in this offering memorandum are presented for illustrative
purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what our actual financial condition or results of operations would have
been had the Acquisitions been completed on the dates indicated. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information reflects
adjustments to illustrate the effect of the Acquisitions had they been completed on the date indicated, which are based upon
preliminary estimates, to record the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting
goodwill recognized. The Issuer will account for the Acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting under French
GAAP and will apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the Acquisitions. In addition, the assumptions
used in preparing the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information may not prove to be accurate. For more information on
the basis of preparation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information presented in this offering memorandum, see
“Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information”.

**_We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value thereof._**

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill. Total goodwill (on a pro forma basis), which represents the excess of
cost over the fair value of the net assets of the businesses acquired, was €3,245.5 million as of September 30, 2020, or
81.3% of our pro forma total assets (including pro forma goodwill). We expect goodwill to increase further as a result of
the purchase accounting for the Medina Acquisition, with exact amounts determined following the purchase price
allocation.

Goodwill is recorded on the date of an acquisition and is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is any
indication of impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance, a decline in
expected future cash flows, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations (including
changes that restrict the activities of, or affect the services provided by, our collection sites and technical platforms) and a
variety of other factors. The amount of any impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to our income statement.
Any future impairment of goodwill may result in material reductions of our income and equity.

**_If we lose the service of members of our senior management team, our business and operating results may be harmed._**

The execution of our strategy and our continued success depend in part on the skills, continued efforts and motivation of
our senior management team and other key personnel. Our strategy for organic growth and improved operating efficiency
depends on our senior management having deep knowledge of our business operations. Our external growth strategy
requires knowledge of the dynamics and relevant players in the various markets in which we operate. Loss of the services
of key members of our senior management or experienced personnel could disrupt the pursuit of our strategy. If one or
more members of our senior management team or key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present
positions, including for health, family or other personal reasons, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all. An
inability to attract and retain qualified members or key personnel in a timely manner could have a material and adverse
effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, if Stéphane Eimer, who is our
Group Chief Executive Officer and founder, and also a majority shareholder of Laboratoire Eimer, no longer owns the
majority of the share capital of Laboratoire Eimer, there could be a serious risks posed to the ownership structure of the
Group. French regulation requires that more than half of the share capital and voting rights of medical laboratories be held
by medical biologists – this requirement is currently fulfilled by the fact that Stéphane Eimer is a medical biologist. If the
majority of the share capital of Laboratoire Eimer is no longer owned by Dr. Eimer, his shareholdings in Laboratoire Eimer
may be required to be transferred to other medical biologists outside the Group to align with regulatory requirements. The
transfer may be difficult to be completed in a timely manner and could significantly disrupt the business of the Group,
which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
See “Business—Our Corporate Structure (SEL/SELAS)” and “—We may not exercise full control over the operations of
_our French subsidiaries in which we have a minority voting interest, including the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and are_
_dependent on the biologists who own a majority voting interest in them to conduct the operations of such subsidiaries”._


-----

**_Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

We are subject to competition from other market participants.

We face competition from other laboratories based on the location of the collection sites and quality of services we are able
to offer to the patients or nurses in France or doctors in Belgium. To a more limited degree, our business also faces
competition from hospitals that are able to provide testing themselves.

We may also face competition from other laboratory companies seeking to acquire the same target companies that we are
considering. Such competition could trigger an increase in the price of acquisition and could adversely affect our ability to
acquire companies and successfully implement our strategy.

Furthermore, we face competition from the increase of more accessible diagnostic technology and services. As technology
develops and advances, it is likely that an increasing number of common and routine medical testing will be able to be
conducted at home, for example, at-home pregnancy tests have become increasingly common and accurate over the years,
thus reducing some of the demand for laboratory blood testing to determine pregnancy. Similarly, certain types of testing
services are also becoming more accessible through clinics, pharmacies and nurses, with the need for laboratory testing no
longer required. In the long-term, this could reduce demand for some of our high-volume medical lab tests and could
adversely affect our strategy and results of operations.

**_Failures of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of customers or business_**
**_opportunities._**

Information technology (or “IT”) systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business and across each of
our lines of business, including for test reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of medical data. Our
operations depend on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems. IT systems are vulnerable to damage
from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts and natural disasters. Moreover,
despite the security measures we have implemented, our IT systems may be subject to physical or electronic break-ins,
computer viruses and similar disruptive problems.

IT problems may impact our ability to process test orders, deliver test results, perform or bill for tests in a timely manner
or maintain the privacy of the medical data we collect. If we experience significant or recurring IT systems problems,
including with our implementation of standard laboratory or billing systems, our operations would be disrupted. If our
operations were so disrupted, it could adversely affect our reputation, expose us to litigation or regulatory sanction and
result in a loss of other customers and negatively affect our net sales.

A flood, fire, other natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, power failure, cyber-attack, computer virus or other catastrophe
affecting a portion of our IT system could have a material adverse impact on its business and its relations with customers.
Measures with the aim of remedying such disasters, safety and security measures, or measures for protecting service
continuity that have been undertaken or may be undertaken in the future by the Group, as well as the effects thereof on the
performance of its network, could be insufficient to avoid losses. The Group is insured against operating losses only up to
a capped amount, any disaster or other damage affecting the network of the Group could result in significant uninsured
losses. We are not separately covered under a cyber risk insurance policy. In the event of a power outage or other shortage,
we do not have a backup or alternative supply source for all of the Group’s network components. The occurrence of any
such event could cause interruptions in service or reduce capacity for customers, either of which could reduce the Group’s
net sales or cause the Group to incur additional expenses.

Additionally, although we typically work with the acquired laboratories to transition their IT systems to integrate with ours
on or prior to closing, they may continue to use their existing IT systems for an indefinite amount of time after their
acquisition. In this case, there is a risk that our operations could be disrupted due to any incompatibility among the
information technology systems we use for a period after closing, which could have an adverse effect on our business and
results of operations.


-----

**_Adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base_**
**_and reputation._**

We have been involved, and may be involved in the future, in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business, including disputes concerning acquisitions, professional liability and employee-related matters, regulatory
matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and health insurance carriers regarding, among other things,
billing issues. Additionally, from time to time, disputes may arise with or in connection with the sellers of businesses we
acquire, some of whom may continue to hold interests in the company and/or management positions. Some of the
proceedings against us may involve claims for substantial amounts and could divert management’s attention from day to
day business operations to address such issues. Proceedings may result in substantial monetary damages, damage to our
reputation and decreased demand for our services, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The
ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid.

In some proceedings in which we are involved or could be involved, material amounts are claimed, or could potentially be
claimed, from us or our subsidiaries and affiliates. Any provisions we set aside in this respect in our financial statements
may prove insufficient if we were found liable, which could have material adverse consequences on our activities and
financial position (particularly on our operating results and cash flow) regardless of whether or not the underlying claim is
well founded.

Outcomes of the litigations in connection with the sellers of businesses we acquire which we may not be parties to may
also have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the period. For example, in
July 2019, we acquired shares in CBM25 from CBM25 Sellers and have consolidated the operations of CBM25 in our
consolidated financial statements. However, due to the pre-emption rights under an existing affiliation agreement between
CBM25 and a counterparty, and a recent court order from Tribunal Judiciaire of Besançon, the deadline of the relevant sale
and purchase agreement has lapsed on December 1, 2020. While none of the Biogroup companies are parties to the litigation
at Tribunal Judiciaire of Besançon, as a result, as of December 1, 2020, we no longer exercise de facto control over CBM25
and will therefore deconsolidate the operations of CBM25 from our consolidated financial statements and the CBM25
Consideration will be recorded as a claim against the CBM25 Sellers on our consolidated balance sheet going forward. For
the year ended December 31, 2019, the CBM25 contribution to our 2019 consolidated pro forma EBITDA amounted to
€5.3 million. See “Business—Legal Proceedings” for more information.

In general, it is possible that, in the future, new proceedings, whether or not connected with those currently underway, may
be initiated against us, our subsidiaries or our laboratory doctors, medical doctors or employees. Since such proceedings
may be lengthy and costly, they could also, regardless of their outcome, have adverse consequences on our activities,
financial position (particularly our results and cash position) and outlook.

**_Failure to bill timely or accurately for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

Billing for our business is a complex process involving several payers. Depending on the billing arrangement, the payer
may be a third party responsible for providing health insurance coverage to patients (such as national public health
insurance or a private medical insurance plan), a patient or other party (such as a clinics, a healthcare agency or an
employer) who outsourced testing to us, or a combination of these parties. Changes in laws and regulations and the payment
policies of third party payers could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process. In addition, we must maintain
procedures to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in order to ensure that we bill properly for our testing,
adding to the cost of the billing process and our ability to collect payment. See “Business—Billing and Payment.”

**_Financial difficulties of certain of our clients or third party payers may require us to write off debts._**

We encounter third party credit risk where we are reliant on the ability of a third party to be able to pay for services we
provide. We are exposed to varying levels of third party credit risk across our lines of business. In France and Belgium,
although the government sets prices for laboratory testing, a portion of the cost is not directly paid by the social security
systems. Based on the size of the private lab market in the industry report and the proportion of spending in the French
private medical testing market according to “Les dépenses de santé en 2019 —Résultats des comptes de la santé,” a report


-----

published in 2020 by Panorama de La Drees Santé, approximately 70.7% (or €3.3 billion) of spending in the French private
medical testing market was financed by the French social security system and the remainder was covered by private
insurance companies (approximately 23.8%, or €1.1 billion) and by the patient directly out-of-pocket (approximately 5.5%,
or €0.3 billion) in 2019. In Belgium, the patient’s out-of-pocket patient expenses amount up to 30% of the total price of
the medical test, on average, and generally act as a deterrent against overspending on medical testing. As a result, we are
exposed to the risk of not being able to collect amounts due from patients who are unwilling or unable to pay the portion
of the cost for which they are responsible. Collection efforts for amounts due from outsourced tests can be difficult.
Significant or recurring incidents of bad debts would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Failure to comply with and liabilities arising under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could result_**
**_in the imposition on us of fines, penalties and other costs and the loss of our licensing, which could have a material_**
**_adverse effect upon our business._**

Our operations are subject to licensing and other requirements under EU, national and local laws and regulations relating
to the protection of the environment and human and occupational health and safety, including those requirements governing
the handling, transportation and disposal of medical samples and biological, infectious and hazardous waste, as well as
those relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. For example, we must meet strict requirements in all
jurisdictions in which we operate for the disposal of testing samples at authorized facilities and undergo regular audits from
national regulators in order to ensure compliance with mandated quality control standards. In addition, we must meet
extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for employees in medical laboratories who could be exposed to various
biological risks such as blood-borne pathogens (including HIV and the viruses that cause hepatitis). These requirements
include work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other
measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens.

The environmental, health and safety regulations to which we are subject, including those governing the disposal of medical
waste, are likely to become more stringent over time, and our costs to comply with these requirements are likely to increase.
Moreover, we could incur substantial costs and sanctions, including civil and criminal fines and penalties, enforcement
actions, or the suspension or termination of our licenses to operate as a result of violations of our responsibilities under
these laws and regulations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We also may become subject
to claims from employees or other persons, such as those alleging injury or illness resulting from exposure to the samples
or waste they handle.

**_Disruption, failure or unsuitable delivery of sample transportation services could adversely affect our business and_**
**_financial results._**

The proper handling of samples during collection and transportation is essential for maintaining their integrity and ensuring
safety from accidental exposure to potentially infectious microorganisms. The vehicles used to transport samples must
satisfy relevant legal, practical and technical requirements, which vary depending on the type of samples transported. These
requirements include, for example, the use of appropriate transport containers and packaging, the labeling of containers,
the manner in which samples and containers are stored in the vehicle, the temperature at which samples must be transported
and the duration of the journey. Drivers employed to transport samples must be trained to handle biological samples in
accordance with best practices and applicable laws and regulations. Mishandling the sample in the collection and
transportation process can increase the likelihood of errors in laboratory testing.

Efficient transportation of samples is key to our business. Our in-house testing business in France operates on a model of
several collection centers where samples are collected and then delivered to technical platforms where testing takes place.
We handle the transport of samples from collection centers to technical platforms through our internal logistics service, or
are supported by external logistics providers mainly for our Ile-de-France operations. In Belgium, our internal logistics
service is responsible for picking up samples at general practitioners’ or specialist doctors’ offices once or twice a day and
deliver them to our network of technical platforms. See “Business—Our Logistics” for more information on our logistics.
We depend on our internal and external (in the case of our Ile-de-France operations) logistics providers to maintain the
integrity of samples during the transportation. In the event of a fault on the part of our internal or external logistics provider,
this may increase errors in our laboratory testing and may result in damage to our reputation, claims against us and the loss
of customers, which would adversely affect results of operations, financial condition and prospects.


-----

**_Disruptions in the delivery of testing supplies could adversely affect us._**

We depend on effective supply and distribution networks of our suppliers to obtain necessary reagents and consumables
for our testing operations and for the maintenance of our testing equipment. Damage or disruption to such supply or
distribution capabilities due to labor strikes at suppliers, loss on non-delivery of such materials or any other reason could
impair our ability to process tests and provide customers with their results in a timely manner, which could damage our
reputation and adversely impact our results of operations. In particular, operations at our labs could be interrupted if, as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our suppliers become unable to deliver necessary personal protective equipment,
reagents or other supplies on time in the required quality. For example, at the beginning of the lockdown period in March
2020, there were delays in shipments of masks and other personal protective equipment (“PPE”), as well as testing reagents
and equipment for COVID-19 diagnostics. To the extent that we are unable to effectively manage such events if they occur,
or cannot financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, they could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Business interruption at one of our laboratory technical platforms could result in significant losses and reputational_**
**_damage to our business._**

We operate a large number of collection sites. While many of these are small, we also operate, and may operate in the
future, larger or strategically important technical platforms that are critical to our operations in France and Belgium. There
is a risk of business interruption at these sites, which could be the result of external factors such as natural disasters, fire,
vandalism or other unforeseen events. Business interruption could also be the result of internal factors such as failure to
comply with regulatory requirements and the resulting loss of authorizations to operate the technical platform. If our
operations at any of our technical platforms were to be disrupted or compromised for an extended period of time, it could
have a material adverse effect upon our business and our results of operations.

Business interruptions could have a significant adverse impact on our business, both by direct loss of net sales and profits
related to the affected collection site, and also through the reputational damage that such a business interruption could have
on our business. While we maintain business interruption insurance for most of our major locations, there can be no
assurance that it would adequately offset our losses in the event of a business interruption. In particular, our business
interruption insurance does not cover losses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Business interruptions could therefore
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Extreme weather conditions may affect our testing volume levels and, consequently, our net sales._**

The volume of tests that we complete depends in significant part on the ability of patients—who are often ill, elderly,
pregnant or have limited mobility—to travel to see a doctor or to a laboratory or test sample collection center. Accordingly,
unusual or inclement weather conditions, particularly those affecting ground transportation conditions, such as heavy snow,
have in the past caused, and may in the future cause, a decrease in demand for our testing services.

**_We are subject to stringent privacy laws and information security policies, and violation of the European Union’s data_**
**_privacy regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation, could subject us to significant fines and other sanctions._**

We receive, generate and store significant volumes of personal and sensitive information, such as patient medical
information, and are therefore subject to privacy and security regulations with respect to the uses and disclosures of
protected health information intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such information. Privacy
and security regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:

� the circumstances under which use or disclosure of protected health information is permitted or required without
a specific authorization by the patient;

� a patient’s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information;

� the requirements to notify patients of privacy practices for protected health information;


-----

� administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health
information; and

� the protection of computing systems that store protected health information.

If we do not adequately safeguard confidential patient data or other protected health information, or if such information or
data are wrongfully used by us or disclosed to an unauthorized person or entity, our reputation may be damaged and we
may become subject to fines, penalties and litigation.

On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) on the protection of natural persons with regard
to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data came into effect. The GDPR requires EU-based
companies or companies that process personal data about EU subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”)
comply with a large number of obligations, which relate for example to (i) the processing of personal data including
transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, security, and confidentiality; (ii) the ability of the controller
to demonstrate compliance with such principles (accountability); (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis before the
processing; and (iv) rights of data subjects, such as, among others transparency, right of access, right to rectification, or
right to erasure.

The GDPR obligates companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the
privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies, or types of data. The GDPR
provides for substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements. Depending on the nature and gravity of the
breaches committed, fines can be up to €10 million or 2% of the previous year’s worldwide turnover, whichever is greater,
or €20 million or 4% of the previous year’s worldwide turnover, whichever is greater, particularly in the event of a breach
of the conditions applicable to consent and/or related to data subjects’ rights. In case of control by the supervisory
authorities, administrative fines are often not applicable before a formal order. The fine may be imposed instead of, or in
addition to, measures that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease the processing). The
GDPR, the national implementing legislation, i.e., the French data protection rules and the Belgian Data Protection Act of
July 30, 2018, and French and Belgian law in general also provide for a private right of action on data subjects for breaches
of data protection requirements and additional private enforcement mechanisms. For instance, supervisory authorities may
issue a public warning, as part of a control revealing infringements of the applicable data protection regulation, and in
parallel a public formal order to comply with the applicable regulation. Such sanction constitutes a reputational risk for the
data controller’s company. The failure to comply with these laws could subject us to significant administrative fines and
sanctions, as well as civil and criminal liability in some cases.

**_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance._**

We carry insurance of various types, including workers’ compensation, employment practices, pension related and general
liability coverage. We maintain insurance policies both at the Group level as well as policies for individual collection sites
that we operate through our various subsidiaries. While we seek to maintain appropriate levels of insurance, not all claims
are insurable and there can be no assurance that we will not experience major incidents of a nature that is not covered by
insurance. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is adequate, but there can be no assurance that
our insurance cover will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all liabilities to which we may subject.
We could, for example, be subject to substantial claims for damages upon the occurrence of several events within one
calendar year. In addition, our insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative development in our
claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost.

**_Labor disputes could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs._**

We are subject to the risk of labor disputes, which may disrupt our operations. Labor laws applicable to our business are
relatively rigorous. In numerous cases, labor laws provide for the strong protection of employees’ interests. In addition,
some of our employees are members of unions or, based on applicable regulations, represented by work councils or other
bodies. In many cases, we must inform, consult with and request the consent or opinion of union representatives or work
councils in managing, developing or restructuring certain aspects of our business. These labor laws and consultative


-----

procedures could limit our flexibility with respect to employment policy or economic reorganization and could limit our
ability to respond to market changes efficiently. Even where consultative procedures are not mandatory, important strategic
business decisions could be negatively received by some employees and employees’ representative bodies, which could
lead to labor actions that could disrupt our business.

Although we believe our relations with employees are good and French law in particular limits the ability of workers
involved in the provision of healthcare services (which would include certain of our employees) to go on strike, our
operations may nevertheless be materially affected by strikes, work stoppages, work slowdowns or other labor related
developments in the future, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Our employees benefit from collective bargaining agreements, and we may not be able to periodically
renegotiate collective agreements on acceptable terms. Settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in
the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements may adversely affect our labor costs,
productivity and flexibility.

**_The results of some entities are fully consolidated in our financial statements, despite the fact that we hold less than_**
**_50% of the voting rights and less than 100% of the financial rights for such entities._**

The results of our French subsidiaries are fully consolidated in our consolidated balance sheet and income statement despite
us owning, directly or indirectly, less than 50% of the voting rights of our French laboratory subsidiaries. See "—We may
_not exercise full control over the operations of our French subsidiaries in which we have a minority voting interest,_
_including the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and are dependent on the biologists who own a majority voting interest in them_
_to conduct the operations of such subsidiaries.” However, although CAB, our wholly owned subsidiary, holds, directly or_
indirectly, less than a majority of the voting rights in these French laboratory subsidiaries, the bylaws of these entities allow
CAB to hold, directly or indirectly, between approximately 51.0% and 99.9% of the financial rights in such entities, in
certain cases through share capital.

In addition, because CAB owns, directly or indirectly, less than 100% of the financial rights in certain of our French
laboratory subsidiaries, we have access to only a portion of the EBITDA and assets of these entities. See note 4.3 of the
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for more information.

**_Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with French GAAP, and any transition to IFRS in the future could_**
**_impair the comparability of our reported and historical results._**

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with French GAAP, which differs in certain
significant respects from IFRS. We have not presented in this offering memorandum a full reconciliation of our French
GAAP consolidated financial statements to IFRS consolidated financial statements. As there are significant differences
between French GAAP and IFRS, if we were to prepare our consolidated financial statements based on IFRS instead of
French GAAP, there could be substantial differences in our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows,
including levels of indebtedness. Accordingly, if we transition our financial reporting standards, accounting policies and
accounting adjustment from French GAAP to IFRS, the comparability of our reported and historical results could be
significantly impaired.

We will be allowed under the Indentures to elect to report exclusively in IFRS. If we do so, the covenant calculations under
the Indentures will be based on IFRS and our covenants may become more or less restrictive from time to time, depending
upon the effect of the standards we adopt. This could result in our being able to take actions that might be to your detriment,
such as incurring greater amounts of debt than would otherwise have been possible had we continued to report in French
GAAP. For a discussion of certain differences between French GAAP and IFRS as applied by us, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Certain differences between French GAAP_
_and IFRS”._

**Risks Related to Our Capital Structure**

**_Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our businesses._**

We currently have, and after the issuance of the Notes will continue to have, a significant amount of outstanding debt with
substantial debt service requirements. As of September 30, 2020 (on a pro forma basis), and as adjusted to give effect to
the Transactions and the application of the proceeds therefrom, we would have had €2,529.6 million of outstanding total
indebtedness, including €750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes offered hereby, €250.0
million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes offered hereby and €1,500.0 million in aggregate principal amount
of borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, we will be permitted to incur additional indebtedness
under the Revolving Credit Facility in the future, as well as other significant additional indebtedness to fund acquisitions
as set out in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Description
_of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Our significant leverage could have important_
consequences for our business and operations and for you as a holder of Notes, including, but not limited to:

� making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debts and liabilities;

� requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thus
reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund acquisitions, organic growth projects and for other general
corporate purposes;

� increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry conditions;

� placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage or greater financial
resources than we have;

� limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business and industry;

� negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

� restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities; and

� limiting, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and
increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt
obligations, including the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to fund acquisitions,
working capital expenditures and other expenses will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate
cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic,
competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate
sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to service our debt or fund our future acquisitions or other
working capital expenditures.

For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources”._

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the_**
**_Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement contain
restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant
qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Under the Indentures, in addition to specified permitted
indebtedness, we will be able to incur additional indebtedness so long as on a pro forma basis our fixed charge coverage


-----

ratio (as defined in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) is at least 2.00 to 1.00. Under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
in the event such indebtedness is secured indebtedness, we will be able to incur additional senior secured indebtedness so
long as on a _pro forma_ basis our consolidated senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, which, among other things, excludes certain specified permitted indebtedness from the calculation of such ratio
and is calculated on a net basis) is no more than 5.75 to 1.00. We will also be able to refinance indebtedness outstanding
under our Revolving Credit Facility with debt incurred in compliance with these ratios and then be able to draw amounts
under our Revolving Credit Facility at a time when we do not meet these ratios. The terms of the Indentures permit us to
incur future debt that may have substantially the same covenants as, or covenants that are more restrictive than, those of
the Indentures. Moreover, some of the debt we may incur in the future could be structurally senior to the Notes and secured
by collateral that does not secure the Notes. In addition, the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement do not prevent
us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. The incurrence of additional debt
would increase the leverage-related risks described in this offering memorandum.

**_French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest on our_**
**_indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness._**

As a general rule, pursuant to Article 39, 1-1° of the French Code général des impôts (the “French Tax Code”), expenses
incurred by a French company are deductible provided, among other conditions, that (i) they are incurred in its direct
corporate interest and (ii) they correspond to actual and justified expenses. In this respect, French case law has developed
the concept of “abnormal act of management”, according to which the expenses incurred by a French company in relation
with transactions that are not aligned with its direct corporate interest are not tax deductible.

Given the complex intragroup transactions within the Group, the risk that the French tax authorities might try to challenge
the deductibility of interest expenses resulting from intragroup financings (e.g., interest expenses on an intragroup loan),
by claiming that such transactions (i) are not performed in the direct corporate interest of the French company of the Group
at the level of which these interest expenses are incurred or (ii) have not been set at arm’s length conditions, cannot be
excluded.

Under Article 39, 1-3° of the French Tax Code, the deduction of interest paid by a French company to lenders who are
direct shareholders of such company but are not related parties to such company within the meaning of Article 39, 12 of
the French Tax Code, is subject to the conditions that (i) the share capital of the borrowing company is fully paid-in and
(ii) the interest rate on the corresponding loans does not exceed a rate equal to the annual average rate of floating rate loans
granted by financial establishments for a minimum term of two years (1.18% with respect to fiscal years closed on
December 31, 2020).

By exception, pursuant to Article 212, I-a) of the French Tax Code, the deductibility of interest paid on loans granted by a
related party within the meaning of Article 39, 12 of the French Tax Code is deductible within the limit of the interest that
would have resulted from the application of the maximum tax rate computed as per Article 39, 1-3° of the French Tax
Code, or, if higher, from the rate that the borrower could have obtained from independent financial establishments in similar
conditions.

Pursuant to Article 39, 12 of the French Tax Code, two entities will be regarded as related if (i) one of the entities holds
directly or indirectly the majority of the other entity’s share capital or actually exercises the power of decision in that entity
or (ii) both entities are placed under the conditions defined in (i) to the control of a same third entity.

In both cases (i.e. non-deductibility under Article 39, 1-3° and 212, I-a) of the French Tax Code, non-deductible interest
might be re-characterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, which may be
subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis, 2 of the French tax Code, at (i) the standard corporate income
tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the second paragraph of Article 219, I of the French Tax Code (i.e. 26.5% for fiscal
years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and 25% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2022) for payments
benefiting legal persons or (ii) the rate of 75% for payments made in non-cooperative jurisdictions within the meaning of
Article 238-0 A of the French tax Code other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A (subject in
any case to more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty).


-----

Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code (which has transposed into French law the interest limitation rules
provided for by Article 4 of the Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 of July 12, 2016 (the “ATAD 1 Directive”)), subject
to certain exceptions and safeharbour clauses, net financial charges (i.e. the portion of financial charges exceeding financial
income) accrued by a company that is subject to French corporate income tax, without distinction between third-party debts
and related-party debts, are deductible from their taxable result only up to a maximum amount equal to the higher of: (i)
€3 million (to be adjusted on a prorata temporis basis for fiscal years which do no last twelve months) and (ii) 30% of the
company’s result before deduction of carried-forward tax losses and before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
adjusted for tax purposes (the “Tax EBITDA”) generated in the same fiscal year (the “General Limitation”).

Where the company is a member of a consolidated group for accounting purposes and is able to demonstrate that the ratio
between its own funds and all of its total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the
consolidated group for accounting purposes to which it belongs, net financial expenses non-deductible under the General
Limitation are deductible up to 75% of their amount (the “Safeguard Clause”).

By exception, where the average amount of the sums made available to a company by all related parties (directly or
indirectly) during a fiscal year exceeds in respect of that fiscal year one and a half times the amount of its own funds (i.e.
where the company is thinly capitalized), the net financial expenses borne by such company are deductible for:

� a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its Tax EBITDA and (ii) €3 million multiplied by a ratio
equal to (A) the average amount of the sums made available to the company by all unrelated parties (directly or
indirectly) increased by one and a half times the amount of its own funds (assessed either at the beginning or at the
closing date of the fiscal year) divided by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the
company during said fiscal year (the “Thin-Cap Limit A”);

� the balance up to the higher of (i) 10% of its Tax EBITDA and (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the
average amount of the sums made available to the company by all related parties (directly or indirectly) exceeding
one and a half times the amount of its own funds (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal
year) divided by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal
year (the “Thin-Cap Limit B”).

However, these thin-capitalization rules do not apply if the company demonstrates that the overall indebtedness ratio of
the consolidated group for accounting purposes (i.e. the ratio existing between the total amount of the consolidated group’s
debts (with the exception of those owed to companies belonging to the consolidated group) and the amount of the
consolidated group’s own funds) to which it belongs is higher than or equal to its own indebtedness ratio (i.e. the ratio
existing between the total amount of its debts and the amount of its own funds).

Net financial expenses in respect of previous fiscal years that are not deductible under the General Limitation, the Safeguard
Clause and the Thin-Cap Limit A as well as a third of net financial expenses in respect of previous fiscal years that are not
deductible under the Thin-Cap Limit B may be deducted up to an amount equal to the positive difference between (i) the
General Limitation in respect of the fiscal year or, where the company is thinly capitalized, the Thin-Cap Limit A in respect
of the fiscal year and (ii) the net financial expenses of the fiscal year reduced, as the case may be, by those subject to the
Thin-Cap Limit B. Net financial expenses not deductible under these provisions can be carried forward indefinitely and
deducted in the future under the same conditions (the “Carry-Forward Clause”).

The unused deduction capacity of a company that is not thinly capitalized (corresponding to the positive difference between
the General Limitation and the net financial expenses deductible under the General Limitation, the Safeguard Clause and
the Carry-Forward Clause) in respect of a given fiscal year may be used over the subsequent five fiscal years to deduct
from the result of those fiscal years the amount of net financial expenses not deductible under the General Limitation and
the Safeguard Clause. This unused deduction capacity may not be used to deduct carried forward financial expenses in
accordance with the Carry-Forward Clause.

Under Article 223 B bis of the French Tax Code, the abovementioned limitations apply mutatis mutandis to companies
that belong to French tax-consolidated groups with respect to amounts made available by creditors outside such group. The
Finance Act for 2020 has transposed into French law the measures to tackle hybrid mismatches provided for in Articles 9,


-----

9 bis and 9 ter of the Atad 1 Directive as amended by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 of May 29, 2017 (the “Atad 2
**Directive”). These measures apply to fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2020, except for some of them which would**
be applicable as from January 1, 2022.

Articles 205 B et seq. of the French Tax Code implementing ATAD 2 provide limitations on interest deductions in the
event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in
the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”) or (ii) a deduction of the same
payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a
“double deduction”). Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises”, except for
the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement whose terms include the valuation of the mismatch effect or
an arrangement that was designed to produce the same consequences as a hybrid mismatch, subject to certain conditions).
If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied
to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income
if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the
deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity.

In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions will also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring
to arrangements where an entity is deemed to be transparent for tax purposes by the Member State in which it is
incorporated or established but the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” holding directly or
indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit are established
qualify the entity as a taxable person. Where a hybrid entity of a reverse hybrid mismatch is incorporated or established in
France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax or taxable pursuant to the conditions
provided for by Article 8 of the French Tax Code, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State.

The abovementioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in France and,
as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility._**

Our Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indentures contain covenants which impose significant restrictions on the way we
operate, including restrictions on our ability to:

� incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;

� make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

� make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures;

� prepay or redeem subordinated debt;

� engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

� create unrestricted subsidiaries;

� agree to limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions;

� sell assets, or consolidate or merge with or into other companies;

� sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis;

� issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries; and

� create or incur certain liens.


-----

These covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or
regulatory developments or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions
could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations; pursue acquisitions, investments or alliances; restructure our
organization; or finance our capital needs.

**_Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indentures, including as a_**
**_result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default which could materially and adversely affect our_**
**_financial condition and results of operations._**

The Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement will require us to comply with various covenants, including a springing
financial covenant in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility requiring us to maintain a specified leverage ratio which will
be tested when loans under the Revolving Credit Facility aggregate 40% of the total commitments under the Revolving
Credit Facility on the last day of a financial quarter. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement”.
Our ability to meet this financial ratio could be affected by a deterioration in our operating results, as well as by events
beyond our control, including, without limitation, any unfavorable economic conditions, and we cannot assure you that we
will be able to meet this ratio. Moreover, the Senior Facilities Agreement includes certain events of default (including,
among other things, events of default for breaches of representations and warranties, an event of default for our failure to
make principal payments when due on certain other debt and financial covenants breach) that are in addition to the events
of default set forth in the Indentures. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
the agent under the Senior Facilities (if directed by the majority lenders thereunder (or majority lenders under the Revolving
Credit Facility in the case of a financial covenant default)) could, amongst other things, terminate any available facilities,
cancel any undrawn commitments and declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and any
other sums then payable, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under other debt instruments, including the Notes,
that contain cross acceleration or cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand in the
event that acceleration occurs under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In these circumstances, our assets and cash flow may
not be sufficient to repay in full that debt and our other debt, including the Notes then outstanding, if some or all of these
instruments were accelerated, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we might not be able to repay our
obligations under the Notes in such an event.

**_The Issuers are holding companies that have limited revenue generating operations of their own and will depend on_**
**_cash from the operating companies of our combined Group to be able to make payments on the Notes or the Guarantees._**

The Issuers are holding companies with limited, business operations of their own. The Issuers are dependent upon the cash
flow from their operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet their obligations,
including their obligations under the Notes or the Guarantees. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the
Issuers will depend on the profitability and cash flows of their subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to declare
dividends under applicable law. The subsidiaries of the Issuers, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under
applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuers to make payments in respect of their
indebtedness, including the Notes and the Guarantees. While the Indentures limit the ability of the relevant Issuers’
subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these
limitations are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by
applicable law. In addition, the subsidiaries of the Issuers that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make
payments with respect to the Notes.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries and effectively subordinated_**
**_to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not secure the Notes._**

Certain of our subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes. Our subsidiaries will not have any obligations to pay amounts due
under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose unless they guarantee the Notes or grant security interests in
this respect. Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders of nonGuarantor subsidiaries, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are
made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors of the relevant Issuer and Guarantors.


-----

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or
is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

� the creditors of the relevant Issuer and Guarantors (including the holders of the respective Notes) will have no
right to proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and

� creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders
will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before
the relevant Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive
any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each related Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including depositors, trade
creditors and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries. For the twelve month period ended September
30, 2020, our restricted subsidiaries that will guarantee the Notes (each on an unconsolidated basis) in aggregate accounted
for substantially all of our consolidated EBITDA.

As of September 30, 2020, the subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer not guaranteeing the Notes had €24.3 million
of third-party debt outstanding.

Any of the debt that our non-Guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future in accordance with the relevant Indenture will rank
structurally senior to the relevant Notes and the related Guarantees and any debt we incur that is secured on property or
assets that do not secure the relevant Notes will be effectively senior to such Notes to the extent of the value of the property
or assets securing such indebtedness.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control,_**
**_and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

Our ability to make payments on or to refinance the Notes or our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating
performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends on general economic, financial, competitive, market,
regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our debt obligations, and
additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when
due, or to refinance such debts, including the Notes. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources
are insufficient to pay obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

� reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures;

� sell assets;

� obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

� restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We may not be
able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all.

In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such time. Any
refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us to comply with more
onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments
and the Indentures may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. Furthermore, we may be unable to find
alternative financing, and even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or
acceptable to us. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially
reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes. In that event,
borrowings under other debt agreement or instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions may
become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all our debts, including the Notes.


-----

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would
likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence
of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of
material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness, including under
the Indentures, restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets. We may not be able to consummate certain dispositions or obtain
the funds that we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset
dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due.

**_We are exposed to interest rate risks, and such rates may adversely affect our debt service obligations._**

A portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate, and we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates,
primarily under the Senior Facilities Agreement, which is based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) and
the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in
the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital
expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_Changes in, or uncertainty relating to, the EURIBOR and LIBOR calculation process may adversely affect the interest_**
**_the Senior Secured Notes Issuer pays on its Senior Facilities._**

The Senior Facilities will bear interest at interest rates based on EURIBOR and/or LIBOR (depending on whether a loan
under those facilities is denominated in euro or sterling), which are deemed to be “benchmarks” and have been the subject
of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already
effective while others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than
in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.

Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) applies, subject to certain transitional provisions, to the
provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark within the EU (which,
for these purposes, includes the United Kingdom). Among other things, it (i) requires benchmark administrators to be
authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed)
and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered
(or, if non-EU based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed).

The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the Senior Facilities if the methodology or other terms of the
benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could,
among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or
level of the relevant benchmark. More broadly, any of the international or national reforms, or the general increased
regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the
setting of a benchmark and complying with any such regulations or requirements.

Specifically, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned as a result of the absence of relevant active underlying
markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of benchmark reforms) for market participants to continue
contributing to such benchmarks. The UK Financial Conduct Authority has indicated through a series of announcements
that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Separately, the euro risk
free-rate working group for the euro area has published a set of guiding principles and high level recommendations for
fallback provisions in, amongst other things, new euro denominated cash products (including bonds) referencing
EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate, among other things, that continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant
contracts (without robust fallback provisions) may increase the risk to the euro area financial system.

It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, LIBOR and EURIBOR will continue to be supported
going forward. This may cause LIBOR and EURIBOR to perform differently than in the past, and may have other
consequences which cannot be predicted., Such factors may have (without limitation) the following effects on certain
benchmarks: (i) discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a benchmark;
(ii) triggering changes in the rules or methodologies used in the benchmark; and/or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the
benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international or national reforms


-----

or other initiatives or investigations, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which
could have an adverse impact on the interest we pay on borrowings under the Senior Facilities. To the extent that interest
rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense could correspondingly increase, thereby reducing our cash flow.

**_We may not be able to finance a change of control offer. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may have the_**
**_right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the_**
**_tender._**

Each Indenture will require us to make an offer to purchase the respective Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase if we experience
certain specified change of control events. The Senior Facilities Agreement also provides for a mandatory prepayment to
lenders thereunder to repay them at par if we experience certain specified change of control events. The source of funds
for any offer to purchase Notes, or repay lenders under the Senior Facilities, required as a result of any such event would
be available cash or cash generated from operating activities or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales
of equity or funds provided by our subsidiaries. Sufficient funds may not be available at the time of any such events to
make any required purchases of the Notes tendered and we may not be able to secure access to enough cash to finance the
required purchases of the Notes tendered. Our failure to effect a change of control offer when required would constitute an
event of default under the relevant Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the other Indenture and the
Senior Facilities Agreement. A change of control may result in an event of default and/or mandatory prepayment obligation
under, or acceleration of, our other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a
default under our other indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. In addition, certain events that may
constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities may not constitute a change of control under the Indentures. The
future indebtedness of the relevant Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions on certain events that
would constitute a change of control.

Further, if pursuant to a change of control offer, holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes, the Indentures will permit the relevant Issuer, at its
option, to redeem the remaining outstanding Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. As a consequence, holders of the Notes may be required to surrender
the Notes against their will at a price equivalent to that paid to tendering holders and may not receive the return expected.

Under the definition contained in each Indenture governing the relevant Notes, a change of control may include a
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the relevant Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole to
any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of
the relevant Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of
control has occurred and whether such Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the relevant Notes. Furthermore,
certain important corporate events that might adversely affect the value of the Notes (including certain reorganizations,
restructurings and mergers) would not constitute a “change of control” under the relevant Indenture. Furthermore, the
occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control under the relevant Indenture will not be
deemed to be a change of control if at the time our consolidated net leverage ratio is less than certain specified levels. For
a complete description of the events that would constitute a “change of control” under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Senior Notes, see the section entitled “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of
_the Senior Notes—Change of Control”._

**_The interests of our ultimate principal shareholder may be inconsistent with your interests._**

The interests of our principal shareholder, Dr. Stéphane Eimer (together with his family members), could conflict with the
interests of investors in the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when
due. Our principal shareholder could cause us to pursue acquisitions or divestitures and other transactions or to make large
dividend payments (subject to limitations in the Indentures and in the shareholders’ agreements entered into with our
investors) or other distributions or payments to him as the shareholder, even though such transactions may involve
increased risk for the holders of the Notes. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that our principal shareholder will not


-----

sell all or any part of his shareholding at any time nor that he will not look to reduce his holding by means of a sale or
otherwise. Such divestitures may not trigger a “Change of Control” under the Indentures.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euros. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a
currency other than euros, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors,
possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which such investors measure
the return on their investments. These changes may be due to economic, political and other factors over which we have no
control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their
investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a
loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which such investors measure
the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars by U.S. holders
(as defined in “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) may also have important tax
consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See _“Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal_
_Income Tax Considerations.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision,_**
**_suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the
potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that
may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject
to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will
remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit
rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time
of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and
terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuers and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and their business
is conducted entirely outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the Issuers and the Guarantors are
non-residents of the United States. Although the Issuers and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New
York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or under the Indentures, you may be unable to effect
service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuers and the Guarantors. In
addition, because all of the assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and all or a majority
of the assets of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce
against them judgments obtained in the U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court,
actions of the Issuers and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws
of the United States. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgements.”

**Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes**

**_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors will have control over the Senior Secured_**
**_Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, and the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets_**
**_securing the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Senior Secured Notes will allow the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and
dispose of any income from the Senior Secured Notes Collateral to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no
acceleration event has occurred, and subject to certain conditions, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course


-----

activities with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing
of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, or the incurrence of_**
**_permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening periods (i.e., the periods of time following the granting of_**
**_security interests during which such security interests may be challenged in accordance with the laws applicable in_**
**_certain jurisdictions)._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees may create hardening periods for
such security interests in certain jurisdictions. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture specifically permits the
release and retaking of security that constitutes Senior Secured Notes Collateral in connection with the incurrence of
permitted debt if certain conditions are satisfied. The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness
permitted to be secured on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods. The
applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been
granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the
respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be
possible to enforce it. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and equity interests for
the benefit of holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

Given that some security interests to be granted by certain Senior Secured Notes Guarantors may be granted after certain
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors accede to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement, this
could trigger the hardening period issues described in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the
_Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The Senior Secured Notes will not be initially secured by all of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral._**

As of the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will not be secured by all of the Collateral, as further described under
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.” We will take such necessary actions so that the Senior Secured Notes
are secured by the Post-Closing Senior Secured Notes Collateral within 60 days after the Issue Date. There can be no
assurance, however, that we will be successful in procuring such liens within the time period specified, the failure of which
would result in an “event of default” under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**_You may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the pledges over shares of French companies_**
**_by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral consisting of shares rather than by a sale_**
**_of such Senior Secured Notes Collateral in a public auction._**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and unpaid to
it. The pledges over financial securities (whether in the form of a pledge over a financial securities account or in the form
of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) of French companies may be enforced at the option of the secured
creditor either by a sale of the pledged financial securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the
secured creditors), by judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or by contractual foreclosure (attribution conventionnelle
_or pacte commissoire) of the financial securities to the secured creditor, following which the secured creditor becomes the_
legal owner of the pledged financial securities. In a proceeding for attribution judiciaire or attribution conventionnelle, an
expert is appointed (whether contractually or by the court) to value the collateral (in this case, the pledged financial
securities) and if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt under the pledge, the secured creditor is
required to pay the relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the difference between the value of the financial securities and the
amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured
creditor from a subsequent sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.


-----

Also, if the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether an attribution judiciaire or an attribution
_conventionnelle), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed financial securities._

Consequently, in the event the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the Senior
Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or as creditor of the parallel debt) decides to, and is entitled to,
enforce the financial securities pledges through a judicial or contractual foreclosure and if the value of such financial
securities exceeds the amount of the secured debt under the pledge, the security agent (acting on its own behalf as well as
for the benefit of the lenders under the Senior Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or as creditor of the
parallel debt) may be required to pay to the relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the value by which such financial securities
exceeds the amount of secured debt under the pledge.

If the value of such financial securities is less than the amount of the secured debt under the pledge, the relevant amount
owed to the relevant creditor will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such financial securities, and the remaining
amount owed to such creditor will be unsecured.

If the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Facilities and the holders
of the Senior Secured Notes or as creditor of the parallel debt) declines to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of
the financial securities, a sale of the pledged financial securities could be undertaken by public auction in accordance with
applicable law. Due to the French regulatory restrictions set forth in the immediately following risk factor, the security
agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Facilities and the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes or as creditor of the parallel debt) is likely to have an incentive to enforce the pledged financial securities
through a public auction. Since public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern (as
the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and
controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the
acquisition of companies or groups of companies) it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not
reflect the value of the Group as a going concern.

**_Your ability to enforce the pledges over financial securities of our French laboratory companies will be limited by_**
**_French law restrictions on the ownership of laboratory companies and future regulatory changes may have an impact_**
**_on the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral._**

French law limits persons who are not medical biologists and entities that are not laboratory companies from holding, in
aggregate, more than 25% of a laboratory company’s share capital and voting rights. Moreover, external medical biologist
and entities that are laboratory companies cannot hold, in aggregate, more than 49.99% of the share capital and 49.99% of
the voting rights in a laboratory company, unless they are incorporated as “5.1” laboratory companies pursuant to a
grandfathering exception. “5.1” laboratory companies in France (including CAB and certain subsidiaries of our Group) are
allowed to have (i) external medical biologist and entities that are laboratory companies to hold, in aggregate, up to 99.99%
of the share capital and 49.99% of the voting rights in such laboratory company and (ii) transfers of the securities of such
laboratory company to be subject to a legal right of first refusal from the in-house medical biologists. See “Business—Our
_Corporate Structure (SEL/SELAS)” and “Regulation—France” for more information._

If the Security Agent seeks enforcement of a pledge over financial securities in a SEL not benefitting from the
grandfathering exception, at least 50.01% of the shares will need to be acquired by laboratory biologists practicing within
the SEL whose shares are being sold, which will decrease the pool of potential buyers, result in a lower sale price. In the
case of a SEL benefitting from the grandfathering exception, the Security Agent may be obligated to offer the shares to the
in-house biologists in the first instance. This could also limit the attractiveness of the acquisition of the laboratory to other
potential buyers. In any event, the Security Agent or any other purchasers (other than the in-house biologists practicing
within such SELs) will hold a minority of the voting rights. In addition, relevant law restricts the ability of such persons or
entities to own shares of SELs operating medical laboratories, thus further reducing the number of potential buyers of our
medical laboratories in connection with the enforcement of the Collateral. These restrictions may limit significantly the
amount you are able to recover under the Collateral in the case of an event of default.


-----

As a result, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce a pledge on the share capital of a French SEL operating medical
laboratories will be limited because it will be able to hold, following a judicial or contractual foreclosure, a maximum of
25% of the share capital of each such SEL, which shares have been pledged.

We may issue new shares to in-house biologists in order to comply with any new law or regulation regarding the
participation of in-house biologists in the share capital of SELs operating medical laboratories. Since the new shares to be
issued to in-house biologists practicing within such SELs would not be pledged to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the
guarantees, the percentage of shares of our French SELs that constitute part of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured
Notes would decrease following such issuance and would be limited to a minority of the share capital of our SELs whose
shares have been pledged as Collateral for the Senior Secured Notes. See “—Risks Related to Our Business—Current or
_future regulatory changes in France, and disputes initiated by the competent administrative authorities or professional_
_associations, may affect our ability to develop our network of French laboratories through acquisitions, make us more_
_dependent on in-house biologists to check operations carried out by SELs, and call into question our organizational and_
_legal structure” and “Regulation—France.”_

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Senior Secured Notes Collateral._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured by the same Collateral securing our obligations under the Senior Facilities
Agreement and certain hedging obligations.

The holders of the Senior Secured Notes do not have separate rights to enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, a common security agent will serve as
the Security Agent for the secured parties under the Senior Facilities, the Notes and the hedging arrangements (if any) with
regard to the shared Collateral (as applicable). The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent will,
subject to certain limited exceptions, act to enforce the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and take
instructions from the relevant secured creditors in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral only at the direction of
an “instructing group”. In addition, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes are not able to instruct the Security Agent,
force a sale of Senior Secured Notes Collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under
the relevant security documents unless it comprises an instructing group, which, in turn, will depend on the quantum of the
creditors in respect of the drawn and undrawn uncanceled commitments under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the
creditors in respect of certain hedging obligations and the creditors in respect of other future senior secured obligations
incurred. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that an “instructing group” is certain classes of creditors which will vote
together as part of an instructing group in relation to any consent or instructions relating to the enforcement of Collateral
or where any matter requires the consent of or instruction from a certain class of creditors.

Disputes may occur between the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
counterparties to certain hedging arrangements, if any, and/or holders of any permitted pari passu secured indebtedness as
to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral. In such an event, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes would be bound by any decisions of the relevant
instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, whether or
not such action is approved by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or may be adverse to such holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. The creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the hedge counterparties and holders of any other
senior secured debt entitled to provide instructions regarding enforcement may have interests that are different from the
interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes and such creditors may elect to pursue their remedies under the security
documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to do so.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Senior Secured Notes or under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is organized under the laws of France; the Guarantors are organized under the laws of
France and Belgium; the Senior Secured Notes Collateral includes the shares of certain of our subsidiaries incorporated
under the laws of those jurisdictions, and certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries in respect of debtors in certain of these jurisdictions. In the event of
bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Your


-----

rights under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral are
likely to be subject to insolvency and administrative laws of multiple jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you
will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex proceedings. In addition, the multi-jurisdictional nature of
enforcement over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and
the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of
the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to
obtain post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The application of these laws, and any
conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular jurisdiction should
apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the guarantees and the security documents in these
jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral that has_**
**_been granted as security for the Senior Secured Notes and future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets_**
**_that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.” Not all of our assets secure the Senior Secured Notes, and the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture allows the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure any future senior
secured indebtedness (as defined in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) permitted to be incurred under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees)
with the property and assets of the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes. The value of such
assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes
are accelerated, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing
such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets that is or are excluded from the Senior Secured
Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes or such secured debt.

**_The value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our_**
**_obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured by pledges over the financial securities held by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and certain Guarantors in certain of our subsidiaries, certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries to certain subsidiaries and certain banks accounts held by Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries. If we default on the Senior Secured Notes, holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets underlying the security interests granted in favor
of holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

In the event of an enforcement of the Security Documents relating to the Senior Secured Notes, the proceeds from the sale
of the assets underlying the Security Documents may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and Senior Secured Notes Guarantors with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees. No appraisal of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral has been made in connection with this
Offering. The value of the assets underlying the Security Documents will also depend on many factors, including, among
other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the
ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the
availability of buyers.

The Senior Secured Notes Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, in part because most of these assets may not be liquid
and their value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Senior Secured
Notes Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry
regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, include restrictions on persons who may own or
operate medical laboratories. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of medical laboratories (or the ownership of an entity


-----

holding medical laboratories) may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such
assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, the transfer of medical laboratories may require, in
certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings. Such consents, approvals or filings
may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of
operations may occur and the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our
assets will not secure the Senior Secured Notes and it is possible that the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will
not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Senior Secured Notes Collateral. With respect to any
shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, such shares
may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity's
shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be
satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the
shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this
Senior Secured Notes Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral are not
sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (to the extent not
repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured,
unsubordinated claim against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors' remaining assets.
See “—Your ability to enforce the pledges over financial securities of our French laboratory companies will be limited by
_French law restrictions on the ownership of laboratory companies and future regulatory changes may have an impact on_
_the value of the Senior Secured Notes_ _Collateral.”_

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of
the Senior Secured Notes on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness
or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or
the security documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, holders of such
additional Senior Secured Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Senior Secured Notes being
offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.

**_In certain jurisdictions, security over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather_**
**_than directly to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes._** **_The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured_**
**_Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

In France where parallel debt obligations are, or a separate appointment of the security trustee for local law purposes is,
customary or required, the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral that will secure the obligations of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees
will not be granted directly to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security
Agent. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that only the Security Agent has the
right to enforce such security documents. As a consequence, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not have direct
security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
securing the Senior Secured Notes, except through the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, who will provide instructions (subject
to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the Security Agent.

The security over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral in France where parallel debt obligations are, or a separate
appointment of the security trustee for local law purposes, is customary or required, will be granted in favor of the Security
Agent as beneficiary of parallel debt obligations (“Parallel Debt”) created to satisfy a requirement that the Security Agent,
as grantee of certain types of collateral, be a creditor of the relevant Guarantor. The Parallel Debt is in the same amount
and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
and the Senior Secured Notes, including any additional Senior Secured Notes (the “Principal Obligations”). Any payment
in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the
Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. The Security Agent will have, pursuant to the Parallel
Debt, a claim against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for the full principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes. The holders
of the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled to enforce such security except through the Security Agent. Holders of the


-----

Senior Secured Notes bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. The
Parallel Debt obligations referred to above are contained in the Intercreditor Agreement, which is governed by English law.
There can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective before French or Belgian courts since there is no judicial
or other guidance as to its efficacy, and therefore the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral may be restricted as the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be invalid or unenforceable with respect to the
claims of any person who is not a party to the relevant security document, including all holders of the Senior Secured
Notes.

In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Senior Secured Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor
Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent. Pursuant to the parallel
debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent that the security interests in the Senior Secured
Notes Collateral created under the parallel debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral.

Further, under a parallel debt structure, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will bear the risks associated with the
possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the parallel debt.

The Senior Secured Notes Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture that
become particularly important following default or events of default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best
interests of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations—France—Exceptional measures related to COVID-19 Epidemic—Parallel Debt.”_

**_Investors' rights in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security_**
**_interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected, and its
priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security, as applicable. The
liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be perfected with respect to the
claims of the Senior Secured Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. The
Security Agent will not be under any obligation to take any steps to perfect any such liens.

**Risks Related to the Senior Notes**

**_The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our secured debt._**

The Senior Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of our present and future secured indebtedness
to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Senior Secured Notes
and the Senior Facilities. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that
secure debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment to the Senior Notes will be available to pay obligations on the
Senior Notes only after the secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets. There may not be sufficient assets
remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the Senior Notes then outstanding. The Senior Notes Indenture will not
prohibit us from incurring additional secured debt, nor will it prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional
liabilities.

**_Your right to receive payment under the Senior Notes Guarantees is contractually subordinated to senior debt._**

The obligations of the Senior Notes Guarantors under their respective Senior Note Guarantees will be contractually
subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all existing and future obligations in respect of
senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor. This senior debt includes the guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes or in the
case of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, and the obligations under the


-----

Senior Facilities. Although the Senior Notes Indenture will contain restrictions on the ability of the Senior Notes Guarantors
to incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial and senior to the guarantees.

Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Senior Notes Guarantor in respect of an insolvency event, the holders
of senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the assets of such Senior Notes
Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such guarantee. Until the senior debt of such Senior Notes
Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which holders of the Senior Notes would be entitled but for the subordination
provisions to be included in the Intercreditor Agreement shall instead be made to holders of senior debt of such Senior
Notes Guarantor as their interests may appear. As a result, in the event of insolvency of a Senior Notes Guarantor, holders
of senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor may recover more, ratably, than the holders of Senior Notes, in respect of
the Senior Notes Guarantor's guarantee in respect thereof.

In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Senior Note Guarantees will provide:

� customary turnover provisions by the Senior Notes Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes for the benefit of
the holders of senior debt of the Senior Notes Issuer or such Senior Notes Guarantor;

� that if a payment default on any senior debt of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Senior Notes Guarantor has occurred
and is continuing, the Senior Notes Issuer or such Senior Notes Guarantor may not make any payment in respect
of the Senior Notes or its Senior Notes Guarantee (as applicable) until such default is cured or waived;

� that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior indebtedness or second lien
indebtedness (if any) that permits the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Senior Notes Trustee
receives a notice of such default, the Senior Notes Issuer or such Senior Notes Guarantor may not make any
payment in respect of the Senior Notes, or pursuant to its Senior Notes Guarantee (as applicable), until (amongst
others) the earlier of (i) the waiver or cure of such default (and, if the relevant designated senior indebtedness or
second lien indebtedness has been accelerated, such acceleration has been rescinded, revoked or waived), (ii) 179
days after the date on which the applicable notice is sent by the senior facility agent, to the senior secured notes
trustee or the second lien facilities/notes creditor representative, (iii) if a Senior Subordinated Standstill Period (as
defined under “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”) is in effect at any time after
delivery of a Senior Notes payment stop notice, the date which is 179 days after the beginning of such Senior
Subordinated Standstill Period, (iv) the date on which the Senior Notes payment stop notice cancelled, (v) the
later to occur of the senior secured discharge date and (to the extent that there are any second lien notes/facilities
liabilities at that time) the second lien discharge date or (vi) the date on which the holders of the Senior Notes take
any enforcement action that is permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement; and

� that the holders of the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of the
majority senior secured creditors and the majority second lien creditors, from taking any enforcement action in
relation to the Senior Notes or such Senior Notes Guarantee, except in certain circumstances.

The Senior Notes Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Senior Notes Trustee
will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees. Moreover,
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture will restrict the rights of holders of the Senior Notes to initiate
insolvency proceedings or take legal actions against each of the Senior Notes Guarantor and by accepting any Senior Note
each such holder will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior
Notes will have limited remedies and recourse under the guarantees in the event of a default by the Senior Notes Issuer or
a Senior Notes Guarantor.

**_The Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Notes Collateral that has been granted as_**
**_security for the Senior Notes and future secured debt may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the Senior_**
**_Notes._**

The Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Notes Collateral described in this offering
memorandum. See “Description of the Senior Notes—Security.” The rights of the holders may therefore be diluted by any


-----

increase in the debt secured by the Senior Notes Collateral or a reduction of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior
Notes. To the extent the claims of the holders of the Senior Notes exceed the value of the Senior Notes Collateral securing
the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees, those claims will generally rank equally with the claims of the holders
of all other existing and future senior unsecured debt ranking _pari passu_ with the Senior Notes and the Senior Note
Guarantees. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as Senior Notes Collateral is less than the value of the claims of
the holders of the Senior Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full. In addition, most of our assets will not secure the
Senior Notes, and the Senior Notes Indenture will allow the Senior Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure
certain types of debt permitted to be incurred under the Senior Notes Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the
Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees) with the property and assets of the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure
the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations
under the Senior Notes are accelerated, the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees will not benefit from the assets
securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured debt of the Senior Notes Issuer and
its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets that is excluded from the Senior Notes Collateral securing
the Senior Notes or such secured debt.

**_The value of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under_**
**_the Senior Notes and such Senior Notes Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

In the event of an enforcement of the relevant Security Documents relating to the Senior Notes, the proceeds from the sale
of the assets underlying the relevant Security Documents may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations of the Senior Notes
Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors with respect to the Senior Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Senior Notes
Collateral has been made in connection with the Offering. The value of the Senior Notes Collateral will also depend on
many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions
that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which
operations are located and the availability of buyers.

The Senior Notes Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Notes may provide for
only limited repayment of the Senior Notes, in part because most of these shares and intercompany loan receivables may
not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the
Senior Notes Collateral will be salable or, if salable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Most
of our assets will not secure the Senior Notes and it is possible that the value of the Senior Notes Collateral will not be
sufficient to cover the amount of debt secured by such Senior Notes Collateral. With respect to any shares pledged to secure
the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity's shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations
of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged
entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the
case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Senior Notes Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds
of the Senior Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Notes, the holders of the Senior
Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Senior Notes Collateral) would have only a senior
unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Senior Notes Issuer's and the Senior Notes Guarantors' remaining assets.

The Senior Notes Indenture will permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Senior
Notes on the Senior Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured debt or third parties enjoy liens, including
statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture or the relevant Security Documents, such holders
or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Notes Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce
the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional notes under the
Senior Notes Indenture, holders of such additional notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Senior
Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Senior Notes Collateral.

**Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes**

**_The insolvency laws of France and Belgium may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States_**
**_or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security_**
**_Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

On and after the Issue Date as described elsewhere in this offering memorandum, our obligations under the relevant Notes
will be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantors and secured by security interests over the relevant Collateral. The Issuers are
organized under the laws of France and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France and Belgium. There is a
rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in the Council of the European Union Regulation No.
134612000 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In addition, the Collateral
will include a pledge over the shares in certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of France and Belgium and
pledges of certain present and future intercompany loan receivables and bank accounts held by the Senior Notes Issuer, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries and third-party Collateral providers (as applicable) incorporated
under the laws of France and Belgium.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or
other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In particular, the French bankruptcy laws and regulations are unfavorable
to creditors in many respects. In the event that any one or more of the Issuers, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuers'
subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions
insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable
principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could
limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuers, the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor and the
enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the
Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and
insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the
relevant jurisdiction's fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may
challenge the guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at
an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a
court, if it makes certain findings, to:

� avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor's obligations under its Guarantee or the Security Interests
provided by such Guarantor;

� direct that the Issuers and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes return any amounts paid
under a Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor's
creditors; and

� take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference,
transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can
ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee
or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting
a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the
Guarantors under the Security Documents (as defined herein) will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as
to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the
possibility that the entire Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be
extinguished. See also “—The Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses
_that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability” below._


-----

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example,
need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the Guarantor:

� issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current
or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency;

� issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent businessman as a
shareholder of such Guarantor would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or where the relevant beneficiary
of the Guarantee or Security Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor was insolvent or a filing for
insolvency had been made; or

� received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee or Security
Interest on the basis that the Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the
Guarantor's benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance
of the Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii)
was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor's assets were unreasonably
small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as
and when they would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in different jurisdictions, be
considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or created any Security Interest if:

� its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

� it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

� the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities,
including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute.

Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance
as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantees
were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine
that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor
was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the
Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees and Security Interests,
see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.”_

**_The Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect_**
**_their validity and enforceability._**

Our Guarantors are organized under the laws of France and Belgium. Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee
against any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuers or the relevant Guarantor, as the case
may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate
benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally.

The obligations of the Guarantors incorporated in France and Belgium and the enforcement of each such Guarantee will
be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction,
to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor's corporate interests, or the burden of such
Guarantee exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor, or such Guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance or
thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor to
contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. An increase in the amount of debt that benefits from


-----

such Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Guarantee will dilute the value of such Guarantee
to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Notes.

Accordingly, enforcement of any such Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be subject to certain defenses
available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Guarantees designed to
ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors. These laws and defenses may include
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, a Guarantor's liability under its Guarantee could be
materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law applicable to it.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing, or providing security in relation to,
indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. Under French
corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee or security unenforceable and, if payment had already been
made under the relevant guarantee, or any proceeds have been obtained from the enforcement of any security, require that
the recipient return the payment or any proceeds so obtained to the relevant guarantor or security provider, if the court
found that the French guarantor or security provider did not receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the
transaction involving the grant of the guarantee or security as a whole. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter
which must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor or security
provider and whether the amounts guaranteed or secured are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as
to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Under Belgian financial assistance rules, a limited liability company is only allowed to advance funds, grant loans or
security interests, with a view to the acquisition or subscription of its own capital shares of profit shares by third parties, if
certain strict conditions as set out in the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations have been complied with. Any
guarantee or security interest granted by a Guarantor incorporated in Belgium which constitutes a breach of the provisions
on financial assistance as defined by Article 5:152 or 7:22 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations, whichever
is applicable, might be null and void and therefore not enforceable. In addition, it may trigger the civil liability of the
directors (i.e. joint and several liability towards third parties and the company itself for a breach of the Belgian Code of
Companies and Associations). In practice, the specific conditions set out in the Belgian Code of Companies and
Associations are quite cumbersome to fulfil. Note that the guarantee limitation language in relation to the Guarantors
incorporated in Belgium, specifically indicates that the guarantee does not extend to any liability to the extent it would
constitute unlawful financial assistance in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Belgian Code of Companies
and Associations.

In Belgium, a transaction entered into by a company must be in its corporate interest, whether such transactions are entered
into for its own benefit or for the benefit of group companies. Corporate interest is not a well-defined term under Belgian
law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal writers. Corporate interest may be held to be present where it can be
shown that (i) the Belgian company itself derives a direct or indirect benefit from the transaction, (ii) the financial risks
that the Belgian company may incur are not be disproportionate to the financial means that are available to it and to the
benefit it derives from the transactions (the ‘proportionality test’) and (iii) the company is a member of a structured group,
with common economic interest. Only the board of directors of the Belgian company can properly assess whether the
conditions are met (and this assessment is a factual matter, which is to be determined on a case-by-case basis). The courts
only exercise a limited ‘marginal review’ whereby they can only determine whether the assessment was reasonable. If a
transaction is entered into contrary to the company’s interest, this can lead to nullity and unenforceability of the transaction.
For an overview on Belgian corporate benefit rules, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the
_Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Belgium—Limitations on Enforcement of the Notes, the_
_Guarantees and Security Interests”._

In light of the proportionality test, the obligations of the Guarantors incorporated in Belgium (and thus the enforcement of
each such Guarantee) is limited to a certain amount to be calculated by reference to the greater of (i) 90% of the Belgian
company’s net assets calculated on the basis of the latest available financial statements at time of entry into the Guarantee,
(ii) 90% of the Belgian company’s net assets calculated on the basis of the latest available financial statements at time of
enforcement on the Guarantee and (iii) the highest amount of on-lending to the Belgian company and its subsidiaries
between the date of entry into the Guarantee and the enforcement of the Guarantee. This guarantee limitation is a combined


-----

guarantee limitation, which applies on a pro rata basis to the guarantee provided by the Guarantors incorporated in Belgium
under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes. For an overview on guarantee
limitation language, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations—Belgium—Limitations on Enforcement of the Notes, the Guarantees and Security_
_Interests”._

In addition, each of the Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited
to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the
applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant
Guarantor's or security provider's corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to
the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance or
thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor
or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In particular, enforcement of
any such Guarantee or Collateral against the relevant Guarantor or security provider would be subject to certain contractual
limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the respective Indentures (or any other document governing the
Guarantees) and Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable
to the relevant Guarantor or security provider. As a result, a Guarantor's or security provider's liability under its Guarantee
or Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions
applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible
that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder
in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of
the Guarantor's Guarantee or the security provider's Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court
may determine that the Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the
relevant Guarantees or Collateral apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the
applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future
Guarantees and Collateral may be subject to similar limitations.

It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in
the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor's guarantee
on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee should be limited or voided.
To the extent that agreed limitations on the Guarantee obligation apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively
subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor. Future guarantees
may be subject to similar limitations. Moreover, an increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Guarantee
without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Guarantee will dilute the value of such Guarantee to its beneficiaries,
including the holders of the Notes. See _“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—The Senior Secured Note Guarantees,”_
_“Description of the Senior Notes—The Senior Note Guarantees” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the_
_Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations,”_

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Guarantees have not been, or will not be, and are not required to be, registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in the United States except
to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other
applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in
the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries comply with applicable
securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream.


-----

Interests in the global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive
registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of bookentry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear
and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest
and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Notes will be made to the paying agent,
which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants'
accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to
indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuers will have no
responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if
investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through
which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indentures.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the
Issuers' solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor
owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from
Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable
such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures, unless and until definitive registered Notes are
issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through
Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to
ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Temporary Notes or the_**
**_Notes will be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

� the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

� your ability to sell your Notes; or

� the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates,
our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely
affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade
securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the
Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes, regardless of our prospects and
financial performance. The initial purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing
the Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market-making activities at any time without
notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and other
applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there may not be an active trading market for the Notes. I f no active trading
market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Notes may not become or remain listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

Although an application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange and admitted to trading
thereon, we cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity
of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting
(whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes, as applicable, from the
Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as applicable, in the
secondary market.


-----

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the_**
**_Notes and the related guarantees will be released automatically without your consent or the Trustee or the Security_**
**_Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes or applicable Guarantees will be released automatically,
including a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral or capital stock of such Guarantor in a transaction that does
not violate the asset sale covenant of the Indentures, and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Indentures will also permit us to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are
Guarantors as unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the
Indentures, all of the liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any guarantees of the Notes by such subsidiary
will be released under the Indentures, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will
reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted
subsidiary or of its subsidiaries. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—The Senior Secured Note Guarantees—
_Senior Secured Note Guarantees Release,” “Description of the Senior Notes—The Senior Note Guarantees—Senior Note_
_Guarantees Release,” “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Release of Liens,” and “Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment-grade ratings._**

The Indentures will provide that, if at any time following the date of the relevant Indenture, the Notes issued under the
relevant Indenture receive an investment-grade rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s, and BBB- or better by S&P or a rating
of BBB or better by Fitch, and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and
continuing until such time as the Notes are no longer rated investment grade by either ratings agency, certain covenants
will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension
_of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—_
_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status”. At any time when these covenants are suspended,_
we will be able to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay cash dividends and redeem subordinated
indebtedness without restriction, each of which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no
assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment-grade rating or that any such rating if achieved will be maintained.

**_If the Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable security._**

In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional
_Redemption” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Optional Redemption” and depending on prevailing market conditions_
at the time, an investor who receives proceeds due to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds
in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that carried by the Notes.

**_The proposed financial transactions tax (FTT) may apply and impact dealings in the Notes._**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a Directive
for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia
(together, except for Estonia, the “Participating Member States”) and which, if enacted and implemented by France,
should replace the French FTT. Following the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (the “ECOFIN”) meeting of
December 8, 2015, Estonia officially announced its withdrawal from the negotiations and, on March 16, 2016, completed
the formalities required to leave the enhanced cooperation on FTT.

The Commission’s Proposal has a very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes
(including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

At the ECOFIN meeting of June 14, 2019, a state of play of the work on the FTT was presented on the basis of a note
prepared by Germany on June 7, 2019 indicating a consensus among the Participating Member States to continue
negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on the French financial transactions tax model which in
principle would only concern shares of listed companies whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union.
However, such proposal is still subject to change until a final approval.


-----

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States, the scope of such tax being
therefore uncertain. The timing of its implementation remains also unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to
participate and Participating Member States may decide to withdraw.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**Use of Proceeds**

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the sale of the Senior Secured Notes will be €750.0 million and the Senior Notes
will be €250.0 million. The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions
are shown in the table below. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including
accrued interest on debt being repaid, the actual date of repayment of certain indebtedness, and differences from our
estimates of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions and fees and expenses actually incurred on or around the
Issue Date. See “Summary—The Transactions”.

**Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information**

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information has been prepared on the basis set out in the notes below and
have been presented for illustrative purposes only in order to give effect to the Laborizon Acquisition, the Medina
Acquisition, and the respective financings thereof (collectively, the "Acquisitions"), as if the Acquisitions and the
respective financings had occurred on the first day of each relevant period being:

� January 1, 2019, for purposes of the _pro forma consolidated income statement for the year ended_
December 31, 2019 (the “2019 unaudited pro forma IS”) and January 1, 2020 for purposes of the Pro Forma
Consolidated Income Statement for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 (the “9M2020 unaudited pro
**forma IS”); and**

� January 1, 2020 for purposes of pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2020 (except for the
Laborizon acquisition, which was already reflected in Biogroup's unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of
September 30, 2020) (the “unaudited pro forma BS”).

See “Certain Definitions used in this offering memorandum”, “Summary—Recent Acquisitions”, “Business” for further
information on the Acquisitions and the respective financings.

The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented below for illustrative purposes only and should not be
considered indicative of the actual results that would have been achieved had the Acquisitions effectively been completed
on the dates assumed and does not purport to illustrate our future consolidated results of operations or financial position.
The actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
information for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used to prepare the unaudited
pro forma consolidated financial information.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the Prospectus Directive or any generally accepted
regulatory standards. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is based upon available information and
certain assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and give effect to events that are directly attributable to the acquisitions
described therein and are factually supportable. Neither the assumptions underlying the _pro forma adjustments, nor the_
resulting pro forma consolidated financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally
accepted auditing standards.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the information included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum under the captions “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”, “Summary
_Consolidated Financial and Other Information”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations”, the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements of Biogroup and the audited and_
unaudited financial statements of Laborizon, Medina and their principal subsidiaries.

**_Basis of preparation_**

The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer is based on and derived from: (i) the unaudited interim
consolidated balance sheet of Biogroup as of September 30, 2020, prepared in accordance with French GAAP (“Biogroup
**BS”) and the unaudited interim consolidated balance sheet of Medina as of September 30, 2020, prepared in accordance**
with Belgian GAAP and from the unaudited statutory accounts of Medina’s companies as of September 30, 2020 (“Medina
**BS”).**

The unaudited pro forma income statement of the Issuer for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 is based on and
derived from: (i) the unaudited interim consolidated pro forma income statement as disclosed in the unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements of Biogroup for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, prepared in accordance with
French GAAP (“Biogroup PF IS 09/2020”), and (ii) the unaudited consolidated income statement information of Medina
for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, prepared in accordance with Belgian GAAP (“Medina IS 09/2020”).


-----

The unaudited pro forma income statement of the Issuer for the year ended December 31, 2019, is based on and derived
from: (i) the unaudited interim consolidated pro forma income statement as disclosed in the audited consolidated financial
statements of Biogroup for the year ended December 31, 2019, prepared in accordance with French GAAP (“Biogroup PF
**IS 12/2019”), (ii) the unaudited consolidated income statement information of Laborizon for the year ended December 31,**
2019, prepared in accordance with French GAAP (“Laborizon IS 12/2019”), and (iii) the unaudited consolidated income
statement information of Medina for the year ended December 31, 2019, prepared in accordance with Belgian GAAP
(“Medina IS 12/2019”),

For purposes of preparing the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information, certain adjustments have been
performed on the basis described herein (the “unaudited pro forma adjustments”). The unaudited pro forma adjustments
are based on currently available financial information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

Only adjustments that are factually supportable and that can be estimated reliably are taken into account. The unaudited
pro forma consolidated financial information does not reflect any future restructuring expenses or integration costs that
may be incurred in connection with the acquisitions nor does it reflect any cost savings potentially realizable from the
elimination of certain expenses or from synergies. The unaudited pro forma consolidated income statements reflect pro
forma adjustments that are expected to have a continuing impact on the Group subsequent to the Acquisitions.

Rounding adjustments have been made in calculating certain of the pro forma consolidated financial information included
herein. Figures shown in some tables and elsewhere may not be exact arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede
them.

**Accounting for the Acquisitions**

_Laborizon Acquisition_

The unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement information of Laborizon combines (i) the audited individual
accounts of the Laborizon subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2019, prepared in accordance with French GAAP,
and (ii) certain consolidation adjustments as described below.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement of Laborizon has not been adjusted to reflect the impact of, or any
changes to, purchase accounting adjustments.

It reflects the following adjustments in order to comply with the Group’s accounting principles and procedures:

1. The consolidation of Laborizon’s subsidiaries using the full consolidation method, in accordance with the Group’s
accounting principles and procedures.

2. Elimination of intragroup transactions and neutralization of intragroup dividends.

3. Recognition of pension liabilities. Evaluation is based on the amount disclosed off-balance sheet within the
respective individual financial statements.

4. Recognition of finance leases according to the Group accounting principles and procedures: recognition of an
asset amortized on a straight-line basis and a financial liability on the balance sheet, and cancellation of the rental
charge in the income statement.

5. Accounting for deferred taxes on consolidation restatements and temporary differences.

_Medina Acquisition_

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information of Medina combines (i) the audited individual accounts of the
Medina subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 or the unaudited individual accounts of the Medina


-----

subsidiaries as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, both prepared in accordance with Belgian GAAP,
and (ii) certain consolidation adjustments as described below.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information of Medina has not been adjusted to reflect the impact on, or
any changes to, on the final the purchase price allocation.

It reflects the following adjustments to align with the Group accounting principles and procedures:

1. The consolidation of the Medina subsidiaries using the full consolidation method, in accordance with the Group’s
accounting principles and procedures.

2. Elimination of intragroup transactions and neutralization of intra-group dividends.

3. Accounting for the acquisition, based on preliminary estimates, using the purchase accounting method to record
the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill.

**Accounting for other GAAP adjustments**

Certain preliminary differences were identified between the accounting policies used to prepare the Group’s consolidated
financial statements in accordance with French GAAP and the accounting policies applied by Laborizon and Medina in
their financial statements prepared in accordance with French GAAP and Belgian GAAP, respectively.

_Laborizon_

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the accounting treatment of reagent supply contracts has been aligned with
Biogroup’s accounting principles, leading to the reclassification from “depreciation and amortization” (which is considered
as finance lease) to “cost of materials”.

_Medina_

Based on our preliminary analysis, we did not identify material accounting reclassifications or adjustments in order to
reflect the group accounting policies in Medina consolidated financial statements. For purposes of the pro forma financial
information, we have reversed the amortization of goodwill, which is permitted in accordance with Belgian GAAP but not
under French GAAP.

**Accounting for the financing of the Acquisitions**

The Laborizon Acquisition was financed through additional drawdowns on the term loan B facility for an amount of €274.7
million and on the issuance of bonds redeemable in preference shares for an amount of €67.5 million without bearing
interest. This is reflected in the adjustments below.

The Medina Acquisition was financed through an additional drawdown under the Existing Term Loan Facilities for an
amount of €446.0 million, an additional drawdown under the Existing Second Lien Debt of €117.8 milllion and with the
issuance of bonds redeemable in preference shares.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information assumes (i) for the term loan B, a rate per annum equal to
4.25% and 4.75% for the financing of the Laborizon acquisition and the Medina acquisition, respectively, and, (ii) for the
second lien facility, a rate per annum equal to 8.25% for the financing of the Medina acquisition.

(1) This column gives effect to the Acquisition of Medina using the purchase accounting method and its related financing. The purchase price and
acquisition costs amount to respectively €1,030.5 million and €49.2 million and financing as described in the basis of preparation. The goodwill
adjustment represents the difference between the purchase price and Medina’s net assets as of September 30, 2020 (€136.4 million); the
preliminary goodwill from the acquisition of Medina is €917.7 million, leading to a pro forma adjustment of €894.1 million. Based on the
preliminary information available, no fair value adjustment related to the acquisition of Medina was identified by management and further
reflected in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information.
(2) These pro forma adjustments correspond to (i) the additional interest expenses calculated for the period and (ii) the amortization of the
transaction costs related to the financing of the Acquisitions using the respective interest rate starting on January 1, 2020.
(3) The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information reflects a theoretical tax effect on additional interest expenses related to the
Acquisitions based on a theoretical tax rate of 32% for the period ended September 30, 2020.

in particular, Laborizon’s pro forma information as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2020. This pro forma income statement also reflects
the acquisition of other less contributive subsidiaries. See note 5.2 of the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in the offering
memorandum.
(2) Under Belgian GAAP, goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis. In order to align Medina’s financial information with French GAAP, a pro
forma adjustment of €3.5 million was presented to reflect the reversal of the depreciation expense recognized in the period ended September 30,
2020. Based on preliminary information available, no additional adjustment was identified by management to conform to French GAAP and the
Group’s accounting principles and procedures. Additional information could result in identifying differences in accounting policies and, where
appropriate, certain amounts reflected in the unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information may differ significantly.
(3) These pro forma adjustments correspond to (i) the additional interest expenses calculated for the period and (ii) the amortization of the transaction
costs related to the financing of the Acquisitions using the respective interest rate starting on January 1, 2020.
(4) The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information reflects a theoretical tax effect on additional interest expenses related to the Acquisitions

**Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations**

_The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended_
_December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020. The following should be_
_read in conjunction with the information set forth under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”, “Summary_
_Consolidated Financial and Other Information”, “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information”, and the_
_consolidated financial statements of the Group and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

The following discussion includes forward-looking statements based on assumptions about our future performance. Our
actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors,
including but not limited to those described under “Forward-Looking Statements”, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this
offering memorandum.

**Overview**

We are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in France and Belgium, providing medical
laboratory testing services through a large and dense network of 742 collection sites across seven regions in France and in
the Flanders region in Belgium as of the date of this offering memorandum. We focus mainly on routine lab testing which
is conducted exclusively in-house and also offer specialized tests which can be performed in-house or outsourced to our
outsourcing partner, Biomnis. Our in-house testing generally comprises approximately 98% of our test volume. We
outsource only a small portion of specialized tests with low demand (thereby less profitable to invest in resources to conduct
the tests in-house). In France, our customers are mainly patients, whereas our Belgian customers are generally both doctors
and patients. Our local technical platforms also assist nearby clinics with their medical testing demands.

We perform a range of over 372 medical lab tests with varying degrees of automation, complexity and volume (including
clinical biochemistry, molecular diagnostics, infertility diagnosis, tumor marker testing, microbiology, cytology and
pathology, allergy tests and genetic tests) for patients who have either generally been prescribed these tests by their doctors
or who elect to get tested for certain non-prescribed medical tests.

We have grown our market presence in France and Belgium through acquisitions of technical platforms and large networks
of nearby collection sites in regions with attractive demographic factors (such as high density populations, aging
populations and affluence), followed by smaller bolt-on acquisitions to create density around technical platforms and ensure
maximization of operating efficiency. Through over 45 acquisitions since 2015, we have demonstrated our ability to
consistently deliver on forecast synergies and cost savings, and extract best-in-class profitability. Our founder and
shareholder Dr. Stéphane Eimer’s strategic vision and successful track record of consolidation, expertise, industry
knowledge and network, further assisted by our investors and competent management at local laboratory levels, historically
have been an important differentiator during these acquisitions, and our culture as a scientifically-led organization (driven
by ownership by a medical biologist instead of a financial sponsor) uniquely sets us apart from our competitors.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, our pro forma net sales were €1,315.2 million and our Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) was €386.2 million. See “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other
_Information—Other Financial and Operating Data.”_

**Factors that affect our Results of Operations**

You should consider the following factors when analyzing our financial condition and results of operations.

**_General Economic Conditions_**

We are exposed to the general economic conditions in France and Belgium. Although the medical laboratory services
market is generally considered to be less sensitive to economic cycles than certain other markets, a prolonged downturn in
general economic conditions may negatively affect our results of operations as governments seek to reduce healthcare


-----

expenditure. Moreover, to the extent patients are responsible for all or part of the costs of laboratory tests, individual
decisions to reduce out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures may result in weaker demand for our services.

**_Regulated Prices for Laboratory Testing_**

We operate in France and Belgium, where clinical laboratory testing services are largely paid for through governmentfunded healthcare programs with regulated prices. The prices are set by regulators in France (CNAM) and Belgium
(RIZIV/INAMI), respectively. Generally, most of our net sales are generated from prescribed tests subject to regulated
prices, and a very limited share of our net sales are generated from non-prescribed tests for which we have discretion to set
prices payable by the patients.

We have limited, or no, influence over the levels at which such regulated prices are set. Due to pressure on the healthcare
budget, the regulators in France and Belgium have historically reduced test prices to counterbalance growth in test volumes,
in particular for high-volume tests. The government-regulated test prices are established based on a pre-designated formula.
See “Industry” for more information. Overall price decreases, or pricing formulas that fail to keep up with testing costs,
may reduce our margins and negatively affect our net sales, our operating results or the economic feasibility of providing
certain testing services by some or all of our collection sites and technical platforms.

European governments, including the governments of France and Belgium, have implemented austerity measures aimed at
reducing government spending, including in healthcare. Prices for medical lab tests we perform are fixed under agreements
with CNAM in France and RIZIV/INAMI in Belgium. Most recently, in France, CNAM entered into the Current Triennial
Plan in March 2020, under which the annual budget growth for medical lab tests is set for three years, and allows an
increase of up to 0.40% in 2020, 0.50% in 2021 and 0.60% in 2022. In Belgium, the healthcare reform measures enacted
in 2005 have reduced the prices for medical lab tests significantly, and since 2010 prices in the private medical laboratory
testing market have increased by approximately 1% per annum, with national social welfare agency contribution roughly
tracking inflation and patient contribution levels remaining stable. See “Industry” for more information. The agreements
with the regulators make our net sales easily predictable. Although these agreements create significant pricing pressure,
they also protect us from adverse impact on pricing due to certain unforeseen external shocks, with the respective
governments providing an additional budget for the increased need for tests during exceptional events, such as the COVID19 pandemic. However, government budget deficits caused by COVID-19 spending could place extra pressure on medical
lab testing related budgets in France, Belgium or any other markets we may operate in the future, which could place further
pressure on testing prices and reduce the level of reimbursement by government entities. This could adversely impact our
business, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. See also “Industry” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Industry—The prices we may charge in our markets are dependent on prices set by governments. Efforts to reduce_
_government spending on healthcare and diagnostic testing may adversely affect our business.”_

**_Demand for Laboratory Tests_**

The volume of tests we perform has a direct impact on our net sales. Demographic trends, including an aging population
and population growth, an increasing prevalence of soft conditions (such as allergies) and chronic, long-term and
lifestyle-related diseases (such as cancer and diabetes), often require recurrent testing. In addition, such trends also require
an increase in the number of medical consultations per person and number of tests per consultation, all of which contribute
to the increased demand for our services. Testing volumes have also increased over time as the medical profession has
shifted its focus towards the prevention and early detection, diagnosis and treatment of chronic and severe illnesses and
has increasingly relied on medical testing for more accurate diagnoses. This shift has been supported by increasing demand
for bespoke healthcare solutions and the potential for preventive medicine to reduce future treatment costs. Furthermore,
the greater health consciousness of the general public, increased disposable income and lifestyle trends such as low levels
of physical activity, poor nutrition and stress, have contributed and are expected to continue to contribute to both volume
growth and a willingness of certain patients to absorb out-of-pocket costs for non-prescription preventive medical tests. In
France, this increase in demand is also driven by population growth (0.3% per annum from 2014 to 2019) and an increase
in the number of tests per consultation (3% to 3.5% per annum from 2014 to 2019) resulting from an aging population with
a higher rate of chronic diseases and a higher number of available tests being prescribed by doctors. The industry has
experienced this increase despite the decrease in the number of medical consultations per inhabitant (1.2% per annum from


-----

2014 to 2019) due to an aging population of physicians, who are retiring faster than new physicians are entering into
practice, as well as a growing trend in self-medication.

The COVID-19 pandemic has driven significant demand for PCR tests and serology tests. As of September 30, 2020, our
cost of reimbursement per PCR test in France was €73.59 and our pro forma cost of reimbursement per PCR test in
Belgium was €46.81. As of January 10, 2021, we have performed more than 6.9 million PCR tests and 0.7 million serology
tests for COVID-19 in France (including tests performed by companies acquired in 2020 prior to their acquisition date),
and as of the end of December 2020, we had performed approximately 0.8 million PCR tests and 0.1 million serology tests
in Belgium. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we generated €184.6 million of pro forma net sales from
COVID-19-related PCR and serology tests, accounting for 21.4% of the Group’s pro forma net sales for the same period.
This increase in our pro forma net sales more than offset the decline of 4.7% in our pro forma net sales during the nine
months ended September 30, 2020 from our other medical testing operations in France and Belgium due to governmentmandated lockdowns and the decrease in patients' demand for routine medical testing as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic.

While the French and Belgian governments have reimbursed the testing services provider the costs of PCR tests in full in
the past, their reimbursement policies have since been updated to require certain conditions to be met to qualify for full
reimbursement, and their reimbursement policies may further change from time to time. For example, as of December 15,
2020, PCR testing services providers in France would be reimbursed by the government for €54.00 for the PCR test, plus
€9.60 for the collection by medical staff, €4.59 for the pre-analytical package including anti-COVID-19 protection for all
staff and €5.40 for the national information database (in total, €73.59 per test) only if the test results are provided within
12 hours from testing. If test results are provided between 12 and 24 hours after testing, testing service providers would be
reimbursed for €43.20 per test; between 24 and 48 hours, €31 per test; and after 48 hours, €0 per test. Moreover, the
Belgian government has announced in October 2020 that reimbursement may only be made for patients with prescriptions,
which has significantly reduced and may continue to significantly reduce the number of tests per week in the country. The
timing and the extent, if any, of any further changes in policies on reimbursement of COVID-19 tests and government
policies in connection with the testing requirements for employees for COVID-19 and the availability of a vaccine against
COVID-19 in France and Belgium remain uncertain. Due to the increase in demand for PCR tests, we have experienced a
temporary increase in costs due to increase in temporary hiring, among others. See “Business—Impact of Coronavirus
_(COVID-19) Pandemic” for more information._

**_Expansion of Our Laboratory Network through Acquisitions_**

In the past several years, our growth and expansion have accelerated through acquisitions. We have expanded our
laboratory network mainly through strategic and bolt-on acquisitions, and intend to continue expanding our network in line
with this strategy. Historically, when we enter a new market we have focused on making strategic acquisitions of strong
technical platforms, followed by further bolt-on acquisitions of collection sites with the aim of building a dense network
of sites around each technical platform to generate synergies and maximize operational efficiencies. For example, in
October 2020, we acquired eight companies of the Medina Group, a leading laboratory operator in Belgium, thus expanding
our operations to the Belgian medical lab testing market. Acquisitions in the regions in which we are already present are
primarily small- and mid-sized bolt-on acquisitions that we integrate into our existing network infrastructure. We achieve
synergies and cost savings in part due to our systematic approach of promptly integrating targets into our centralized
framework agreements, the majority of which we are able to achieve between the first day of integration and within a few
weeks thereafter. For example, our acquisitions of Bioesterel in December 2018 and Biolittoral in June 2019 both resulted
in EBITDA margin increases which exceeded our initial target margin. For a timetable of the principal acquisition activity
undertaken by our Group since January 1, 2017 through the date of this offering memorandum, see “Business—Our
_History” and notes 2.1 and 5.1 to our Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. In_
the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we completed
nine, eleven, sixteen and nine acquisitions, respectively, for aggregate consideration.

Our acquisitions have resulted in increased net sales, EBITDA and EBITDA margin, with historical acquisitions exceeding
our initial target EBITDA margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of scale in enhancing our financial performance. Due
to the number of acquisitions that we have undertaken and intend to continue to undertake, our results of operations from
period to period may not be comparable.


-----

Acquisitions affect our results of operations in several ways. First, our results for the period during which an acquisition
takes place are affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired business in our consolidated results. Acquired
businesses are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, so the full impact of an acquisition is only reflected in our
financial statements in the subsequent period. In addition, the results of the acquired businesses after the acquisition may
be impacted positively by synergies and cost savings. For example, the businesses we have acquired in the past have
generally generated savings on reagent purchases and personnel expenses, including remuneration of self-employed
biologists who are not on our payroll, mostly at the closing date, and have realized savings on technical and administrative
expenses over a longer period of time.

Because of the nature of the businesses we acquire, we carry a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet
(€3,245.5 million as of September 30, 2020 on a pro forma basis). Goodwill is subject to an impairment test both on an
annual basis and whenever there are indications of impairment, such as a decrease in net sales or EBITDA. We may record
significant charges in our income statement as a result of impairment of goodwill under French GAAP.

In France, we have experienced payment delays from the French social health insurance system and private health insurance
following mergers between Group entities, which have negatively affected our cash flow from operating activities. We are
reimbursed only upon the transmission of patient files to the national health insurance. After a merger, we are required to
re-register biologists under the newly formed entity, which causes delays in the transmission of files and consequently in
reimbursement. In the event of such delays due to mergers that take place close to year end, certain cash flows from
operating activities may not be realized during the relevant period.

We intend to further expand our network by continuing to acquire collection sites and technical platforms in France and
Belgium, and selectively explore opportunities to purchase existing laboratory networks in new markets.

**_Synergies and Cost Savings Initiatives_**

Synergies and cost savings are key components of our profitability because they provide us with increased test volume and
allow us to compensate for the price pressure from government payors while continuing to grow our business. Our synergies
and cost savings are mainly realized from (i) contractual savings, such as a decrease in the salaries of the target's biologists,
who are otherwise incentivized by becoming shareholders after the acquisition, (ii) replacement of supplier contracts at the
target with our master agreements (or, where possible, renegotiating contracts to align prices with ours) so as to achieve
economies of scale through lower prices and (iii) centralization of testing in one regional technical platform, enabling us
to streamline the overall number of employees or replace a biologist with a lower-cost technician. In certain cases, our
synergies initiatives may lead to certain limited one-off costs.

**_Changes in Regulation_**

The medical diagnostics industry (including medical laboratory testing) is subject to extensive regulations and controls by
various regulatory authorities in France and Belgium. See “Regulation”. These regulations mainly pertain to professional
qualifications of laboratory personnel, ownership and corporate governance constraints on companies operating medical
laboratories, as well as pricing and reimbursement levels for medical tests. Changes made to laws and regulations in the
past have had, and in the future may continue to have, a significant impact on our results of operations. In particular,
compliance with current or future laws and regulations may result in an increase in our administrative, legal or operational
expenditures and may require changes in our commercial practice or company structure.

We are also subject to stringent regulations and strict accreditation procedures in France and Belgium, governing the
granting or the renewal of a license to operate a laboratory and the standards by which any such laboratory is operated. We
collaborate closely with our regulators to stay up–to-date with the latest developments in the relevant regulations in France
and Belgium, particularly with respect to obtaining accreditation under the new accreditation requirement pursuant to the
more rigorous ISO 15189 standard, under which we plan to apply for 100% accreditation by the April 30, 2021 deadline.
Compliance with current or future laws and regulations may (i) cause an increase in our administrative, legal and
operational expenditure, (ii) force us to alter our commercial practices, our legal organization, the ownership structure or
corporate governance of our subsidiaries or, more generally, (iii) reduce or limit our net sales. See “Business—Quality
_Standards” and “Regulation”, and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry –_ _We operate in a highly regulated sector._


-----

_Compliance with regulations applicable to our activities may increase our costs or restrict our activities. Failure to comply_
_with such regulations may lead to penalties of various types. Future alterations to regulations applicable to us may have_
_a material adverse impact on our activities”._

**_Organic Growth_**

Our results of operations are also affected by organic growth in our businesses. Organic growth is a non-French GAAP
measure. Organic growth is determined as follows:

� in respect of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, we have excluded the impact of
acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2019;

� in respect of revenue for 2019 (compared with 2018), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions on revenue by
assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2018;

� in respect of revenue for 2018 (compared with 2017), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions on revenue by
assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2017.

From 2018 to 2019, we have generated organic net sales growth of 2% in France and 3-4% in Belgium from 2010 to 2018,
exceeding that of the overall market (approximately 0.8% from 2014 to 2019 in France and 2-3% from 2010 to 2018 in
Belgium) due in part to our structural exposure to regions exhibiting greater organic growth in testing volumes. Our
historical organic growth in Ile-de-France, the largest market in France, was 2.8% from 2016 to 2019, which was well
above the market average of 1.1% from 2014 to 2019.

**_Sensitivity of Our Cost Structure_**

Our cost base is largely fixed. Only a few regular expenses, namely consumption of materials and supplies (consisting
mainly of reagent purchases) and costs for outsourced tests, certain external expenses and a small portion of personnel
expenses are fully variable. Personnel expenses, which represented 31.4% of our net sales for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020, are also largely fixed, in part due to French and Belgian labor laws limiting workforce reductions and
requiring in France the presence of at least one medical biologist in every lab.

In the context of an acquisition, we believe that our ability to manage staff costs (mainly through reduction in biologists
remuneration secured by closing, and reduction and re-deployment of staff to fully leverage our “hub-and-spoke” model)
and other operating costs of target labs to quickly deliver operating synergies and cost savings minimizes our exposure to
any variability in costs.

We experience limited seasonality in the volumes of tests we perform and, consequently, in our net sales. We have
historically performed fewer tests during holiday and vacation periods, notably in the summer months and around the
winter holidays. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a short-term increase in costs due to an increase in
temporary hiring in 2020 in response to the additional demand in PCR testing.

**Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements**

The accounting impacts of the acquisitions are not limited to our consolidated net sales but may also affect the other income
statement line items, including our operating expenses, our depreciation and amortization charges and our cost of debt.

**Key Income Statement Items**

Below is a summary description of the key elements of French GAAP line items of the income statements of the Group.


-----

**_Net sales_**

Net sales correspond to sales of our testing services primarily provided to direct patients (which represented more than
95% of our net sales from 2017 to 2019) and, to a lesser extent, to hospitals and clinics (which represented approximately
3% of our net sales from 2017 to 2019). Net sales consists of net sales from services rendered in the course of ordinary
activities and are recognized when a report is validated by the medical biologist, which is the date when the results are
communicated to the client. For our direct patients in France, our net sales are derived from the French social healthcare
system (Sécurité Sociale), complementary additional private health insurance plans and, in certain cases, directly from
patients, and are based on the rates set annually by the French government.

**_Cost of materials and supplies_**

Cost of materials and supplies primarily include the costs of reagents and other consumables, net of volume-based rebates
received from suppliers, and associated inventory variations.

**_Personnel expenses_**

Personnel expenses principally include wages, salaries, remuneration of self-employed biologists who are not on our
payroll, compulsory social security contributions, post-employment benefits and other long-term benefits, and employee
profit sharing (as required under French law for our French operations). See “Regulation—France” for more information
on employee profit sharing requirements under French law.

**_Other purchases and external expenses_**

Other purchases and external expenses include mainly consumables (subcontracting costs and staff costs dedicated to
external sample collection (such as costs relating to the collection of test samples by nurses at patients’ homes), operational
leases, maintenance costs, mail and telecommunication expenses, fees to external service providers (audit, accounting,
legal), insurance and travel expenses.

**_Taxes and duties_**

Taxes and duties include certain tax payments, including CVAE payments and payroll tax.

**_Other operating income and expenses_**

Other operating income and expenses principally include miscellaneous income and expenses not related to the operation
of our collection sites and technical platforms, including, among others, operating subsidies and reimbursement to
employees on sick leave.

**_Depreciation and amortization charges net of reversal_**

Depreciation and amortization charges net of reversal include regular depreciation and amortization of non-current assets
such as intangible assets, buildings, laboratory equipment, computers and software. When applicable, they also include
impairment of non-current assets and provisions for operational risks, disputes, pensions, bad debt and overdue receivables.

**_Cost of debt_**

Cost of debt include interest and related expenses, such as interest on bank loans, interest on bonds issued to shareholders,
swap-related finance costs and accrued interest and related expenses.

**_Other financial income/(expenses)_**

Other financial income/(expenses) include miscellaneous income and expenses not related to the cost of debt.


-----

**_Net non-recurring income (loss)_**

Net non-recurring income (loss) includes legal reorganization fees, issuance costs of borrowings, gains/losses on dilution
related to mergers, gains/losses on disposal of assets, exceptional increases/reversals and any other non-recurring
income/expenses.

**_Income tax_**

Income tax includes current income tax on taxable profit and deferred tax income and expenses. It does not include other
taxes payable by us, including CVAE, which are recorded under the line item “Taxes and duties” in our French GAAP
income statement.

**Results of Operations**

**_Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020_**

_Net sales_

Our net sales increased by €279.4 million, or 63.9%, from €437.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019,
to €716.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to mergers and
acquisitions we completed during 2019 (primarily the acquisition of Unilians) and during the nine months ended September
30,2020 (primarily the acquisitions of Laborizon and Dyomedea). The acquisitions made during 2019 and the nine months
period in 2020 represent consolidated net sales of €244.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Excluding the effects of our mergers and acquisitions, our net sales from organic growth increased by €95.2 million, or
25.2%, from €377.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, to €472.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020, primarily driven by the increase in testing volumes for PCR tests due to the increased demand in
connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.


-----

Our net sales generated from PCR and serology tests for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was €184.6 million.

_Cost of materials and supplies_

Cost of materials and supplies increased by €65.6 million, or 137.2%, from €47.8 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019, to €113.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to
the acquisitions we completed during 2019 and during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase was also
driven by the increase in testing volume for PCR tests due to the increased demand in connection with the COVID-19
pandemic in 2020, as the cost of reagents for PCR tests are higher than the average cost for reagents for other medical tests
we perform.

As a percentage of net sales, cost of materials and supplies increased from 10.9% for the nine months ended September 30,
2019, to 15.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 negatively impacted by the PCR cost of reagents.

_Personnel Expenses_

Personnel expenses increased by €62.8 million, or 38.7%, from €162.5 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2019, to €225.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions
we completed during 2019 and during the nine months ended September 30,2020, as well as additional full-time equivalent
(“FTE”) employees whom we hired to help us handle the increase in testing volumes for PCR tests due to increased demand
in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. We also granted COVID-19 pandemic-related bonuses during the nine
months ended September 30, 2020 which further contributed to the comparative increase.

Personnel expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from 37.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to
31.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This decrease is based on a larger increase in net sales from the
increase in testing volume for PCR tests compared to the additional FTE employees we needed to meet the increased testing
volume during the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 5,620 FTE employees, which increased to 9,253 FTE employees as of
September 30, 2020, which were primarily due to acquisitions during the respective periods.

_Other purchases and external expenses_

Other purchases and external expenses increased by €26.0 million, or 30.6%, from €84.9 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019, to €110.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to
the acquisitions we completed during 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

As a percentage of net sales, other purchases and external expenses decreased from 19.4% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 to 15.5% for nine months ended September 30, 2020, as further set forth in the table below:

**Nine months ended September 30,**

**2019** **2020**

**(€ in millions)**

Fees ................................................................................... 4.7 6.2

Others ............................................................................... 16.5 12.0

Other purchases and external expenses ............................ 84.9 110.9


-----

_Taxes and duties_

Taxes and duties increased by €7.1 million, or 39.5%, from €18.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019
to €25.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions we
completed during the periods in 2019 and 2020. As a proportion of net sales, taxes and duties decreased from 4.2% to 3.5%
of net sales between 2019 and 2020.

_Other operating income and expenses_

Other operating income and expenses remained stable, with a loss of €0.1 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2019 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

_Depreciation and amortization charges net of reversal_

Depreciation and amortization charges net of reversal increased by €3.3 million, or 26.8%, from €12.2 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019, to €15.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was
primarily due to the additional depreciation and amortization charges on fixed assets incurred by the laboratory companies
we acquired during 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

_Operating income_

Due to the changes in the line items discussed above, our operating income increased by €114.6 million, or 102.8%, from
€111.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, to €226.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2020.

_Cost of debt_

Cost of debt increased by €11.4 million, or 22.2%, from €51.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, to
€62.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the financing of the
acquisitions we completed during 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due
to additional drawings under the Existing Term Loan Facilities, drawings under the Existing Second Lien Debt, and
issuance of convertible bonds, the proceeds of which were used to finance our acquisitions during the respective periods.

_Other financial income_

Other financial income increased by €0.1 million, or 23.7%, from €0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2019, to €0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

_Net financial income/(loss)_

Net financial loss increased by €11.3 million, or 22.2%, from €(51.0) million for the nine months ended September 30,
2019, to €(62.3) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Within net financial loss, cost of debt increased
by €11.4 million, or 22.2%, from €(51.3) million nine months ended September 30, 2019, to €(62.7) million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to additional drawings under the Existing Term Loan
Facilities, drawings under the Existing Second Lien Debt, and issuance of convertible bonds, the proceeds of which were
used to finance our acquisitions during the respective periods.

_Operating income before tax_

Due to the changes in the line items discussed above, operating income before tax increased by €103.3 million, or 170.7%,
from €60.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, to €163.8 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2020.


-----

_Net non-recurring income (loss)_

Net non-recurring loss increased by €0.6 million, or 18.7%, from €(3.1) million for the nine months ended September 30,
2019, to €(3.7) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Net non-recurring losses during the periods mainly
comprise of gains and losses on disposal or mergers, amortization of borrowings costs, and impairment charges, such as
depreciation of goodwill at the amount of €8.1 million that was recognized at Laboratoire Eimer as of September 30, 2019,
of which value in use was calculated based on a multiple of 12 times the relevant EBITDA.

_Income taxes_

Income taxes increased by €29.7 million, or 121.6%, from €24.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019,
to €54.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions we
completed during 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Income tax included current tax expense and deferred tax expense as set forth below for the respective periods:

**Nine months ended September 30,**

_Net income of consolidated companies_

Due to the changes in the line items discussed above, net income of consolidated companies increased by €73.1 million, or
221.5%, from €33.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, to €106.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020.

Our net sales increased by €259.1 million, or 74.3%, from €348.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to €608.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions we completed during
2018 and 2019. In 2018 and 2019, respectively, we completed 11 and 16 acquisitions in Corsica, Grand Est, PACA, Ilede-France and AURA.

Excluding the effects of our mergers and acquisitions, our net sales from organic growth increased by €4.6 million, or
2.0%, from €233.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to €237.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
primarily due to the increase in net sales resulting from our presence in dynamic regions, including PACA, Ile-de-France,
Grand Est and AURA, as well as from our Biolam LCD operations, which benefit from their location in metropolitan areas.
The acquisitions made during 2018 and 2019 represent consolidated net sales of €371.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019.

_Cost of materials and supplies_

Cost of materials and supplies increased by €24.9 million, or 61.9%, from €40.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, to €65.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions we
completed during 2018 and 2019. As a percentage of net sales, cost of materials and supplies decreased from 11.5% for
the year ended December 31, 2018, to 10.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting improved purchase
conditions due to our growing market share, which allowed us to renegotiate the purchase price of reagents.

_Personnel Expenses_

Personnel expenses increased by €98.0 million, or 73.4%, from €133.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to
€231.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions we completed
during 2018 and 2019.

Personnel expenses as a percentage of net sales slightly decreased from 38.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018, to
38.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily due to better absorption of fixed costs from growth
in scale and realized synergies.

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 3,961 FTE employees, which increased to 5,620 FTE employees for the
year ended December 31, 2019, which were primarily due to acquisitions during the respective periods.

December 31, 2018, to €115.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the
acquisitions we completed during 2018 and 2019. As a percentage of net sales, other purchases and external expenses
decreased slightly, from 19.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018, to 19.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019,

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business
operations, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and
other commitments, as well as acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operating activities and our
financings. Our liquidity requirements arise primarily to fund acquisitions, to meet our debt service obligations, and, to a
lesser extent, to fund capital expenditures and to utilize as working capital.

Our financial condition and liquidity are and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors, including:

� our ability to generate cash flows from our operations;

� the level of our outstanding indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, and the interest we are obligated
to pay on such indebtedness, which affects our net financial expense;


-----

� our ability to continue to borrow funds from financial institutions; and

� our external growth funding requirements, which consist primarily of the funding of acquisitions of additional
laboratories.

Our cash requirements consist mainly of the following:

� funding acquisitions;

� servicing our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries;

� funding capital expenditure needs;

� operating activities; and

� paying taxes.

Our sources of liquidity consist mainly of the following:

� cash generated from our operating activities;

� net proceeds from our outstanding debt securities, including bonds redeemable in preference shares, bonds
convertible in shares and the Notes;

� borrowings under our loan facilities; and

� capital contributions from our shareholders.

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operating activities, together with available borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, we cannot assure you
that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities or that future debt financing will be available
to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity
needs.

**Consolidated Cash Flow Statement**

The following table summarizes Group's consolidated cash flow statement for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018,
2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020.

compared with a cash inflow of €111.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Cash flows from operating
activities during the periods were primarily due to the acquisitions we completed during 2019 and the nine months ended


-----

September 30, 2020. Cash flows from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 also accounts
for the increased PCR testing volume due to the COVID-19 pandemic, despite a negative impact of change in working
capital. See “—Working Capital” below for more information.

Net cash flow from operating activities represented a cash inflow of €16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
compared with a cash inflow of €127.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash flows from operating activities
during the periods were primarily due to the acquisitions we completed during 2018 and 2019. Excluding the effects of our
mergers and acquisitions, our net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased
compared to 2018 due to a decrease in non-recurring cash outflows related to one-off costs related to the reorganization of
our capital structure, which we incurred during 2018. Operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were
negatively affected by changes in working capital due to an increase in trade receivables and payment delays from the
French social health insurance system and private health insurance subsequent to mergers between certain Group entities
(notably CAB with Analyseo, and BPO-Bioépine with BPO), resulting from the requirement to re-register biologists under
the newly formed entity, which causes delays in reimbursement. See “Factors that affect our Results of Operations—
_Expansion of Our Laboratory Network through Acquisitions” above._

Net cash flow from operating activities represented a cash inflow of €33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017,
compared with a cash inflow of €16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flows from operating activities
during the periods were primarily due to the acquisitions made during the last quarter of 2018, and related one-off financing
costs which were recorded under non-recurring items. Excluding the effects of our mergers and acquisitions, cash flows
from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was further affected by an increase in non-recurring cash
outflows related to one-off costs related to the reorganization of our capital structure, which we incurred during 2018.

**_Net cash flow from Investing Activities_**

Net cash flow from investing activities represented a cash outflow of €515.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,

activities during 2019 include cash expensed to acquire businesses for €380.7 million, net of cash acquired, mainly in
connection with Laborizon and Dyomedea acquisitions. Cash flows from investing activities during the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 include investment in fixed assets of €23.0 million, which was higher than the preceding period, which
was mainly related to the purchase of PCR testing equipment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Net cash flow from investing activities represented a cash outflow of €629.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
compared with a cash outflow of €515.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding the effects of our
mergers and acquisitions, cash flows from investing activities during the periods were primarily due to the opening of new
technical platforms and purchases of new testing equipment for improved capacity, as well as the opening or refurbishment
of our laboratories.

Net cash flow from investing activities represented a cash outflow of €149.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017,
compared with a cash outflow of €629.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flows from investing activities
during the period were primarily due to the acquisitions of businesses made during the two years presented.

compared with a cash inflow of €405.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Cash flows from financing
activities during the periods were primarily due to additional drawings for the financing of acquisitions completed during
2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, net of repayments of borrowings and refinancing. Cash flows from
financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 also include the issuance of bonds redeemable in
preferred shares for an amount of €67.5 million.

**Working Capital**

In line with industry, our working capital is structurally negative due to low inventories and low days sales outstanding
(“DSO”) (typically 15 days), as our principal payment counterparties are CNAM and RIZIV/INAMI. For more information
on our billing and payment, see “Business—Billing and Payment”. Moreover, due to limited seasonality, our working
capital generally remains stable over the periods, except for fluctuations due to tax and social security-related payments,
such as quarterly corporate income tax payments.

Changes in working capital amounted to €(68.3) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to €(4.2)
million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to (i) a temporary increase in receivables and (ii) an increased
level of inventories during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to dedicate
personnel to welcome and guide patients at our collection sites, which caused temporary delays in electronic transmission
of files to CNAM for reimbursement and therefore resulted in an increase in receivables. As of the date of this offering
memorandum, we are experiencing no such delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect the level of receivables
to return to historically normal levels in early 2021, given our reinforced staffing and reduced delays in the transmission
of files. Moreover, we have also increased our inventories in connection with COVID-19-related PCR tests (primarily
reagents for PCR tests and personal protective equipment) to prevent any shortage.

**Capital Expenditures**

Capital expenditures consist of additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Our acquisition capital
expenditures are primarily related to goodwill recognized from the acquisitions of collection sites and technical platforms.
Our maintenance and growth capital expenditure primarily relate to refurbishment of collection sites and technical
platforms, acquisition of testing machines and other equipment, furniture, fixtures, fittings and office equipment.

While we do not typically buy testing equipment necessary to conduct our in-house testing operations, we purchased PCR
testing equipment in March 2020 in connection with the increased demand for COVID-19-related tests. See “Business—
_Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic” for more information._

Our net cash capital expenditures, including amounts paid for business capital and goodwill associated with acquisitions,
for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were €139.1
million, €654.6 million, €532.2 million, and €448.1 million, respectively.

Our net cash capital expenditures, excluding amounts paid for business capital and goodwill associated with acquisitions,
for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were €9.5 million,
€14.8 million, €9.9 million, €22.2 million, respectively.

**_Pensions and Similar Obligations_**

Our provisions for pensions and similar obligations amounted to €14.8 million as of September 30, 2020. These obligations
include pensions commitments. For a description of our pension obligations, see note 3.18 of the Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Off-Balance Sheet Commitments**

We are a party to various customary off-balance sheet arrangements, which includes pledge receivables and bank accounts.
See note 8.1 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Financial Risk Management**

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Our primary exposure to market interest rate risk due to the fluctuations in interest rate relates to the Revolving Credit
Facility and Term Loan Facility, as the interest payable thereunder are on a floating basis. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement” and “Capitalization” for more information on the Revolving Credit Facility_
and the Term Loan Facility after giving effect to the Transactions and related terms thereunder. We have entered, and may
in the future, enter into hedging transactions and use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the adverse effects of this
risk from time to time.

**_Credit Risk_**

Our primary exposure to credit risk relates to our trade receivables. Health authorities in France and Belgium are our
principal payment counterparties, which reduces our credit risk. We also believe our credit risk is reduced because neither
our customer base nor our geographical footprint are concentrated. Outstanding receivables from customers are regularly
monitored and collected on when overdue by way of a multi-step collections procedure. While we are limited in our ability


-----

to minimize credit risk of customers prior to transactions due to our public service obligations, we receive a significant
portion of our net sales from business with health insurers who are nationwide partners under statutory health insurance
schemes or public authorities.

**_Foreign Exchange Risk_**

We have not historically been exposed to foreign exchange risk as we conduct our business based on euro in the markets
where we operate. However, any future international acquisition in jurisdictions that do not conduct business in euro may
expose us to the risk of greater exchange rate fluctuations.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

We manage liquidity risk by ongoing monitoring of our cash flows on a regular basis. In order to manage our liquidity
needs, we also have a rolling liquidity plan, which is prepared on a periodic basis or after major acquisitions. In light of
the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have considered a number of downside sensitivities to
our base case budget in 2020 and into 2021, including certain stress test scenarios, and plan to do so for any future
exogenous events that might affect our liquidity.

**Certain differences between French GAAP and IFRS**

Our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Unaudited Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum have been prepared in accordance with French GAAP. Certain differences exist between French
GAAP and IFRS that may be material to the financial information presented therein. As there are significant differences
between French GAAP and IFRS, if we were to prepare our consolidated financial statements based on IFRS instead of
French GAAP, there could be substantial differences in our results of operations, cash flows and financial position,
including levels of indebtedness.

In particular, the estimated IFRS 16 impact on EBITDA and financial debt for the twelve months ended September 30,
2020 (as further described below) is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to be what our EBITDA
and financial debt would have actually been, had we prepared our consolidated financial statements based on IFRS.

The discussion set forth below summarizes certain differences identified between French GAAP as applied by the Group
and IFRS, following a limited analysis of both sets of principles. The Group is responsible for preparing the summary
below and has not prepared a reconciliation of its consolidated financial information from French GAAP to IFRS.

In making an investment decision, investors must rely upon their own examination of the Group, the terms of the Offering
and the financial information. Potential investors should consult their own professional advisors for an understanding of
the differences between French GAAP and IFRS and how those differences might affect the financial information herein.
Potential investors should not take this summary to be a comprehensive list of all differences between French GAAP and
IFRS.

Some differences between French GAAP and IFRS, as they relate to the Group, are listed hereafter.

� CVAE has been classified as other operating expenses under French GAAP rather than income tax under IFRS.

� Retirement indemnities would have been treated differently under IFRS than French GAAP, but we do not deem
this difference to be material for the Group.

� Certain acquisition costs and issuance borrowing costs are capitalized under French GAAP rather than being
expensed as they would be under IFRS.

� Valuation of financial debt differs from French GAAP under IAS 32 and IFRS 9.

� Recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities differs from French GAAP under IAS 12.


-----

� IFRS 16, applicable since January 1, 2019 is a significant difference between French GAAP and IFRS. Application
of IFRS 16 to the Group would:

� increase EBITDA by replacing the operating lease costs by depreciation of right of use and interest on
rents. The impact on EBITDA is estimated to be €57.4 million for the twelve months ended September
30, 2020. This impact is calculated by cancelling the total rent charge plus the estimated embedded leases
(in connection with our technical equipment) contained within our reagent contracts; and

� increase the financial debt as of September 30, 2020 by €204.7 million. This estimation is based on
assumptions taken by the Group, notably with regards to duration and discount rate.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

Preparation of our consolidated financial statements under French GAAP requires us to use judgments, estimates and
assumptions, including expectations of future events, which affect the reported amounts of certain financial statement line
items.

These assessments and estimates are reviewed at each reporting date and the underlying assumptions are adjusted, where
appropriate, based on actual results, experience and any other relevant factors given the economic circumstances. The
effects of such adjustments are recognized when made. The items reported in our future consolidated financial statements
may differ from current estimates due to changes in the assumptions made and economic circumstances at the reporting
date.

The accounting policies and estimates we consider to be the most critical in understanding the assumptions and judgments
that are involved in preparing our financial statements in accordance with French GAAP and in understanding the
uncertainties that could affect our financial results, financial condition and cash flows are presented below.

� consolidation methods;

� accounting for goodwill;

� accounting for pension and similar commitments;

� accounting for provisions for risks and charges; and

� accounting for income tax.

A more detailed description of the accounting rules and methods that we apply under French GAAP is provided in note 3
to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements and to the Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum.

_Consolidation Methods_

All significant investments in affiliates that are exclusively controlled by the Group, either directly or indirectly, are fully
consolidated.

French law requires that the medical biologists that operate a laboratory company (SEL or SELAS) hold a majority of the
share capital and voting rights of such laboratory entity. As a result, medical biologists operating our laboratory companies
hold at least 50.01% of their respective voting rights. See “Business—Our Corporate Structure (SEL/SELAS)” for more
information.

However, we typically retain 90% or more of the financial rights of our laboratory companies. We also maintain de facto
control over our subsidiaries' actions through shareholders' agreements, including on major operating decisions such as
acquisitions, incurrence of debt and yearly budgeting. As such, our French entities are fully consolidated.


-----

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

_Accounting for goodwill_

Goodwill represents the difference between the acquisition cost of shares in consolidated companies and the share of the
fair value identified at the acquisition date. Goodwill is determined by comparing the acquisition price of the shares to the
share acquired of the following items:

� shareholders' equity at the end of the period preceding the acquisition (less any dividends distributed during the
period in which the acquisition took place),

� share of net income at the acquisition date;

� retirement provisions;

� deferred tax assets in relation to retirement provisions;

� deferred tax assets in relation to temporary differences;

� deferred tax assets in relation to carried-forward tax losses; and

� amortization of business capital and of net technical loss from mergers.

� Where necessary, goodwill has also been reduced by the sum of the following two items:

� any dividends received during the period in which the acquisition took place, as these are taken into account when
determining the price of the acquired shares; and in the event of new goodwill arising following an increase to an
existing holding, the amount of any goodwill, net of amortisation, at the end of the previous period.

Intra-group gains on sales of business capital are eliminated.

Insofar as it is not composed of identifiable assets, business capital recognized in the balance sheets of Group companies
can be equated with goodwill. It is therefore adjusted as follows in the consolidated financial statements:

� disclosure within intangible assets; and

� impairment test, performed with the same method as goodwill.

Goodwill (and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives) are subject to testing for impairment at least once a year
and whenever there is an indication of impairment. In assessing value in use, we apply a multiple of EBITDA (12 times
EBITDA in 2019, 11 times EBITDA in 2018 and 10 times EBITDA in 2017).

_Accounting for pension and similar commitments_

In accordance with the laws and practices of France, we grant our employees post-employment benefits and other longterm benefits.

We recognize provisions for all employee benefits calculated in accordance with the retrospective actuarial method. As
such, pension commitments are measured using the projected unit credit method for all employees based on estimated
wages at career-end. We defer the recognition of actuarial gains or losses to the income statement.

_Accounting for provisions for risks and charges_

Provisions for risks and charges cover probable or certain obligations with an uncertain due date or of an uncertain amount,
resulting from litigation, retirement awards and negative goodwill. A provision is recognized whenever the Group has a


-----

contractual, legal or implied obligation arising from a past event and when future cash disbursements can be reliably
estimated.

We examine all litigation in which we have been involved, and, after seeking external advice, provisions are recognized
whenever necessary to cover the estimated risks.

_Accounting for income tax_

Income tax comprises current and deferred taxes. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss unless they
relate to a business combination or to items that are recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

Corporate tax represents tax payable, less any amounts in relation to tax losses carried back, research tax credits and
sponsorship tax credits.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated separately for each Group company and primarily arise from temporary
differences between accounting profit and taxable profit, consolidation adjustments and carried-forward tax losses.

We apply the liability method and recognize deferred tax wherever the value of an asset or liability for tax purposes is
different from its value for accounting purposes. The effects of changes in tax rates are recognized in profit or loss for the
period during which the changes is tax laws are enacted.

Deferred tax assets arising from carried-forward tax losses are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that they
will be offset against future profits within a reasonable timeframe. The possibility of recognizing a tax asset in our
consolidated financial statements is thus limited by the recommendations issued in Regulation 99-02 (règlement CRC 99_02), as amended January 1, 2017, accounting regulation relating to consolidated accounts of commercial companies and_
public enterprises in France.

The French Finance Act of 2010 eliminated the business tax (taxe professionnelle) as of 2010 and replaced it with two new
taxes: the property business tax (cotisation foncière des entreprises, or the “CFE”) and the value added business tax
(cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des entreprises, or the “CVAE”). Under French GAAP, the CVAE is recognized under
the line taxes and duties of the operating income. See “Tax Considerations—Certain French Tax Consequences” for more
information.

**Industry**

_Certain of the information set forth in this section has been derived from external sources. Industry surveys and_
_publications generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable,_
_but some of this information may have been derived from estimates or subjective judgments or have been subject to limited_
_audit and validation. While we have examined and relied upon certain market or other industry data from external sources_
_as the basis for our estimates, we have not independently verified such data._

**Overview**

We are a leading European player by net sales in the medical diagnostics services industry conducting most of our business
in France and, following our recent acquisition of Medina Group in Belgium. We are specifically focused on private
medical laboratory testing, primarily conducting routine laboratory tests and, to a lesser extent, specialized laboratory
testing.

**Medical Laboratory Testing**

Medical laboratory tests (“MLT”) are medical examinations carried out to obtain information about a patient’s health for
the purpose of aiding in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease. These tests are used to facilitate medical
decisions and increase the efficiency of healthcare systems by providing prompt and accurate diagnoses. This improves the
quality of care for patients and reduces the ultimate cost of medication and/or hospitalization. The healthcare industry’s
focus is increasingly shifting from the treatment of patients’ existing medical conditions to the prevention and early
detection of medical conditions. This shift is leading to greater reliance of diagnostic testing services and, consequently,
increasing demand for medical laboratory testing.

The customer base in the medical laboratory services market is diverse and spans both the public and private sectors.
Customers include individual patients as well as hospitals, public and private clinics, medical practices and laboratories,
physicians, blood collection points, public health agencies, pharmaceutical companies and medical research organizations.

MLT are performed either in public hospitals with in-house labs or in private independent laboratories. Laboratories such
as ours receive business either from patients who choose to have their tests performed by a particular laboratory, or directly
from physicians or clinics who send samples for analysis. In France, we conduct the majority of our business using a B2C
model where patients choose our private labs after having received a prescription from an independent doctor or from a
hospital / clinic. In Belgium, our business is primarily B2B, as most samples are taken by doctors or physicians rather than
in high-street labs and, consequently, it is the doctors or physicians, not the patient, deciding which lab will test the samples.

Medical laboratory testing can be broadly split between routine laboratory testing and specialized laboratory testing.
Routine laboratory testing includes common diagnostics tests that help medical professionals make informed decisions
when treating a patient. For example, patients can be prescribed routine tests in connection with a diagnosis, monitoring
and treatment of medical conditions such as cancer, infectious diseases, blood disorders or pregnancy, among other uses.
Routine tests are typically of low complexity and based on the analysis of bodily fluids, including blood and urine.
Specialized laboratory testing consists primarily of complex and relatively rare laboratory testing needs that local smaller
laboratories and hospitals are unable to meet due to the specialized technical equipment required to run such tests.

**Market Characteristics**

We operate in the private medical laboratory testing market where, according to the industry report, in both France and
Belgium, approximately 90% to 95% of tests by volume are routine tests, while the remaining 5% to 10% are specialized
tests. In our industry, routine testing is highly automated, scale driven, and efficiency-oriented. According to the industry
report, in 2018, the top 15 most frequent tests in France, representing approximately 60% to 65% of the private MLT
market in volume and approximately 66% of all routine test volumes, were: (1) blood test for cell count test including
platelet, (2) blood test for glucose and glycemia, (3) blood test for ionograms, (4) blood test for transaminases, (5) blood
test for c-reactive protein (“CRP”), (6) blood test for creatinine, (7) blood test for gamma glutamyl transferase, (8) blood
test for lipid abnormality, (9) blood test for urea and creatinine, (10) test for sedimentation rate, (11) blood test for thyroid

-----

stimulating hormone (“TSH”), (12) testing of prothrombin time in case of VKA treatment (“INR”), (13) blood test for
ferritin, (14) blood test for hemoglobin A1c (“HBA1C”) and (15) blood test for alcalin phosphatase.

**France**

In France, doctors typically prescribe MLTs, allowing patients to freely choose the medical laboratory in which the tests
will take place. Patients tend to choose laboratories based on proximity to their home or workplace. Accordingly, the choice
of a high traffic location, reputation for quality of services and quick deliverability of results are key success factors for
medical testing laboratories.

According to the industry report, in 2019, public hospital laboratories in France represented approximately 35% to 40% of
MLT market value. This includes large public hospitals with in-house labs and their own practitioners, as well as small and
mid-sized hospitals that tend to outsource part of their testing volumes to private labs. Per the industry report, private
independent labs, such as Biogroup, represented approximately 60% to 65% of MLT market value in France in 2019 and
largely comprise high-street labs with capable of providing and processing tests for both public and private hospital labs.

**Market size and trends**

France is one of the main markets in Europe for private MLT. As per the industry report, the French MLT market generated
revenues of approximately €7.5 billion to €8.0 billion in 2019. Estimates from the industry report show that the accessible
market for private laboratories amounted to approximately €4.7 billion while the accessible market for public laboratories
reached approximately €2.8 billion to €3.3 billion in France in 2019.

The French private MLT market varies across regions in both supply and demand characteristics due to demographic
disparities regarding aging populations and the number of pregnant women, the two most significant users of medical
laboratory testing services. According to the industry report, Île-de-France is the region that makes up the largest share of
the private MLT market in France, with an estimated total of €0.9 billion in 2018, followed by Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes
with €0.6 billion and PACA with €0.5 billion. These regions benefit from large populations, high laboratory density and
the highest density of practitioners in France.

We believe we are well positioned across the largest and most attractive regions of France. In total, we operate 718
laboratories across seven regions and have a strong presence in Île-de-France, which comprises 26% of our portfolio, while
the Île-de-France, Auvergne Rhône-Alpes and the PACA (representing rapidly growing or aging populations, metropolitan
areas with above-average population density and relative affluence) represent 56% of our laboratories portfolio in total.

The private MLT market is underpinned by a number of secular tailwinds and, as a result, has historically proven to be
resilient. According to the industry report, between 2007 and 2011, which included the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the MLT
market grew by approximately 2% to 3% per year as CNAM, the French social security system, did not reduce its expenses
during the economic downturn due to the importance of healthcare in the French public system from a social and political
perspective. From 2014 to 2019, the French private MLT market continued growing in value, albeit at a reduced pace of
0.7% to 0.8% per year from approximately €4.5 billion in 2014 to approximately €4.7 billion in 2019.

Going forward, we believe the French MLT market will continue to grow, driven by a more favorable triennial plan (as
further described below) and steady volume growth supported by strong fundamentals. In general, we do not expect growth
in the private MLT market to outpace the public MLT market as French regulators are committed to maintaining adequate
capacity in the public sphere. Nevertheless, we believe steady demand driven by the medical profession’s growing focus
on preventative care will continue to result in outsourcing from public hospitals to private medical testing providers.

Moreover, in the current COVID-19 context, the medical laboratory testing market has benefitted from an additional
revenue stream outside the budgetary envelope dictated by the Current Triennial Plan. We believe this may continue to
provide additional upside to lab operators in the future.

We are well positioned to benefit from the growth trend due to our economies of scale, our operational excellence and
record of customer satisfaction that will enable us to maintain and improve our established growth trajectory. In particular,


-----

we believe that our cost control policy and operational efficiency allow us to absorb pricing pressure better than many of
our smaller competitors.

**Healthcare system**

Based on the size of the private lab market in the industry report and the proportion of spending in the French private
medical testing market according to “Les dépenses de santé en 2019 —Résultats des comptes de la santé,” a report
published in 2020 by Panorama de La Drees Santé, approximately 70.7% (or €3.3 billion) of spending in the French private
medical testing market was financed by the French social security system and the remainder was covered by private
insurance companies (approximately 23.8%, or €1.1 billion) and by the patient directly out-of-pocket (approximately 5.5%,
or €0.3 billion) in 2019.

Given MLT services are largely funded by the French state, French medical laboratory test prices are regulated and dictated
by a three-year renewable agreement between CNAM and medical biologists’ labor unions (“Triennial Plan”) that, due
to pressure on the healthcare budget, aims to limit CNAM MLT expenses by capping the overall budget’s growth rate.
Historically, high testing volume growth above the Triennial Plan’s budget growth cap has led to tightening pricing levels
for tests.

Government-regulated test prices are established based on a B-Key methodology, which derives prices from the sum of
the direct cost of the test, service fees and other applicable extra costs. Test prices are revised at least annually in order to
ensure adherence with the Triennial Plan’s budget constraints.

In practice, to define prices for reimbursable tests, CNAM publishes a quotation grid, which fixes prices for specific tests
through coefficients (the “B-Key Test Coefficient”). A test’s B-Key Test Coefficient is then multiplied by a standard value
applicable to all tests (the “B-Key Value”) to determine the direct cost of the test. The B-Key Value, which can be revised
by CNAM, has remained fixed since 2002 at €0.27, besides two exceptional and temporary decreases. The final price is
then derived by adding additional fees including service fees and other applicable extra costs (e.g. for processing patient
data, collecting information required for the tests, fast-tracking or certifications) to the test’s direct cost. Generally, more
specialized and newer tests are not initially included in the price list and thus not reimbursed. As a result, MLT companies
can set prices freely for these tests.

Since the introduction of the Triennial Plan in 2013, high volume growth has been consistently offset by price reductions.
According to the industry report, over the 2014 to 2019 period, test volumes increased by approximately 2.0% to 2.5% per
year, however, CNAM has contained its MLT expenses to a growth of only 0.25% per year over the same period. As per
the industry report, this resulted in test price reductions of approximately 1.5% over the period, affecting mainly high
volume-tests with prices reduced by approximately 5% per year for the top 15 high volume routine tests between 2016 and
2018.

The Current Triennial Plan for the period between 2020 and 2022 was signed on March 11, 2020 and allows an increase
of up to 0.40% in 2020, 0.50% in 2021 and 0.60% in 2022. This plan is more favorable than the previous plan, where
budget growth was limited to 0.25% per year over the 2014 to 2019 period. Although the Triennial Plan creates pricing
pressure, it also protects our industry from unforeseen external shocks by providing an additional budget to meet the
increased need for tests during an exceptional event. In this context, COVID-19 tests' are considered an exceptional event
and are therefore not included in CNAM’s annual capped budget, which for 2020, was fixed at €3.76 billion. In addition,
while routine tests’ volume has decreased significantly during the lockdown from March to May 2020, the CNAM
cancelled the revision of prices that generally takes place mid-year.

**Belgium**

According to the industry report, in 2018 the private MLT market in Belgium was primarily B2B, with approximately 80%
of test volumes originating from samples taken by doctors or specialist physicians and subsequently sent to testing facilities.
As a result of this model, medical practitioners are the ones that decide which lab will process the samples. Typically,
doctors work consistently with one lab and have high stickiness, valuing quick turnaround time, service (such as daily


-----

sample pick-up) and user-friendly IT platforms. Laboratories are legally prohibited from incentivizing doctors or specialist
physicians to work with them.

As per the industry report, in 2018, the private MLT market segment accounted for approximately 35% to 40% of the
broader Belgian MLT market by value. This trend has been stable in the past four years, with the remaining approximately
60% to 65% of tests carried out by public hospital labs. The value of the estimated accessible MLT market in Belgium in
2019 was €0.6 billion.

**Market size and trends**

According to the industry report, the Belgian MLT market generated revenues of approximately €1.6 billion in 2018, of
which private laboratories amounted for approximately €0.6 billion. We have a leading market presence in the largest
Belgian market, Flanders, which had a private MLT market value of approximately €360 million in 2018. The other two
leading regions in Belgium are comparatively smaller, valued at approximately €180 million in Wallonia and
approximately €50 million in Brussels.

Over the 2016 to 2018 period, according to the industry report, Belgian MLT market volume grew by 1.5% per year. This
rate is slightly lower than in France and is primarily explained by measures taken by the country’s medical social welfare
agency to reduce medical overconsumption, including lab tests. Despite relatively tepid volume growth, the market in
general has benefitted from pricing growth, with the fixed sum of national social welfare contributions growing at
approximately 1% to 3% per year between 2010 and 2020, according to the industry report.

Going forward, as predicted by the industry report, market growth is expected to slow due to potential price erosion of
conventional prices as well as pressures on the non-regulated portion of the price paid by consumers that could be impacted
by changes in regulation enforcing more transparency to the patient.

**Healthcare system**

In line with European neighbors, medical laboratory tests are largely reimbursed by the Belgian national social welfare
agency and, as such, prices are regulated. As in France, the Belgian government uses a B-Key methodology where a
standard fixed coefficient is multiplied by a test-specific value (the “B-Value”) to determine each test’s base price. The
fixed coefficient in 2020 for clinical biology was €0.032012. The B-Values have historically remained stable, with standard
routine test ranging typically between 500 to 4,000. However, the fixed coefficient changes yearly due to indexation and
has demonstrated marginal growth increasing from €0.0309 in 2017 to €0.032012 in 2020. The worth of one B-Value is
therefore €0.008 to date. In addition, a fixed sum (the “Fixed Sum”) can be added to the base price. Together, the sum of
the base price and the Fixed Sum represent the reimbursable portion of a test’s price. Historically, price growth of this
reimbursable portion has been driven by the Fixed Sum, whose growth broadly tracks inflation. CAGR for the
reimbursement rate of B-Values from 2010 to 2020 was 0.29% and the Fixed Sum per test ranged between €25 and €30,
with a CAGR from 2010 to 2020 of 2.55%. Notably, and in contrast with the French regime, in addition to the reimbursable
and regulated portion of a test’s cost, in Belgium MLT operators are also able to charge clients a non-reimbursable and
non-regulated price supplement. (provided that the medical laboratories are not “conventionalized”
(geconventioneerd/conventionnés).

As per the industry report, the national social welfare agency contribution generally ranges between 70% to 100% of the
ultimate test price, while patient contribution ranges between 0% and 30% of the total price. In addition, patients are
charged an additional nominal administrative fee, typically up to 10%, except for certain patient categories that are exempt.
Typically, supplements in addition to regulated prices are between €0 and €5 per prescription and help drive high levels of
profitability within the Belgian market when compared to other European countries.

**Key Market Drivers**

There are a number of key trends that we expect will impact the medical laboratory testing market in Europe, including
France and Belgium, and our business specifically. Overall, we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the
medium and long-term based on the key trends discussed below.


-----

**_Volumes Supported by Resilient Long Term Tailwinds_**

We believe that the medical laboratory testing market will continue to benefit from a number of positive tailwinds. One of
the key drivers of testing volumes is expected to be demographic trends and lifestyle changes, which are driven by both
increased life expectancy and positive net migration balances. For example, according to the _Institut National de la_
_Statistique et des Études Économiques (“INSEE”), the French population increased at a CAGR of 0.4% between 2007 and_
2019, while the number of individuals aged 60 and over also grew within the same period. INSEE reported that the French
population aged 60 and over accounted for approximately 26% of the total population in 2019, while in 2007 it accounted
for only approximately 21%. Further, recent years have seen the growth of chronic diseases that result from certain lifestyle
choices, such as low levels of physical activity, malnutrition and stress, as well as aging. We believe that these demographic
trends will lead to increased demand for healthcare services and, as a result, increase the volume of medical testing.

Similarly, according to Statistics Belgium (the public entity for population data in Belgium), the Belgium population
increased at a CAGR of 0.6% between 2009 and 2020, while the number of individuals aged 65 and over grew to represent
approximately 19% of the total population in 2020, compared to 17% in 2009. As for France, we believe that these
demographic trends will lead to increased demand for medical testing services.

**_Shift Towards Preventative Medical Care_**

According to the industry report, the average number of tests prescribed per medical consultation in grew at a rate of
between 3.0% to 3.5% between 2014 and 2019. Healthcare policies are increasingly focusing on preventive care as
politicians and doctors alike recognize the benefits of early detection and prevention of chronic and severe diseases, both
from a public budget and medical perspective. As a result, in France, guidelines prepared by the Haute Autorité de Santé
push for increased prevention and screening tests. In Belgium, although part of the cost of testing is borne by the patient,
there is a gradually increasing demand for preventative testing. We believe that this trend, which is already accelerated by
the prevalence of COVID-19 tests, is set to continue and will drive overall demand and volumes for laboratory testing
services.

**_Pricing Trends_**

In both France and Belgium, medical laboratory test prices are driven by public budgets. Although budget constraints have
historically limited pricing growth in both markets, such constraints have not constrained overall revenue growth.

In France, in order to contain healthcare spending, CNAM has historically decreased test prices to ensure that its
expenditures remain below volume growth. Over 2014 to 2019, CNAM agreed on a growth rate of 0.25% per year in the
medical laboratory testing budget, resulting in price erosion given the higher growth of test volumes. In the Current
Triennial Plan, CNAM has allowed for higher annual growth rate of CNAM expenses ranging from 0.40% to 0.60% over
the period. However, volume growth is expected to outpace this, thereby continuing to drive price erosion.

According to the industry report, historical prices of routine tests in the private medical laboratory testing market in
Belgium have increased by approximately 1% per annum from 2010 and 2020, with national social welfare agency
contributions roughly tracking inflation and patient contribution levels remaining stable. In the future, we believe the
market could face some price erosion due to a reduction in the national welfare agency contribution as Belgium has a high
and increasing social security deficit.

In general, pricing pressures remain part of operating in the medical laboratory test market and we expect such pressures
to continue in the future. We believe that our market leading position, dense laboratory network and economies of scale
put us at an advantage compared to smaller peers to withstand future pricing pressures.

**_Market Consolidation_**

Consolidation has been a key feature of the European laboratory testing market in the recent past. According to the industry
report, in France, the top six players in 2019 represented approximately 70% of total market value, compared to
approximately 30% in 2013. We believe that this trend towards consolidation will continue being a feature of the market


-----

due to a combination of factors, including pricing pressures from payers, enhanced quality and accreditation standards and
the increasing complexity and technical demands of tests. We expect that these higher fixed costs, coupled with continuous
pricing pressure, will make it more difficult for smaller players to maintain their current levels of profitability. As has been
seen in the past, we expect that this will drive M&A activity as consolidation allows laboratories to achieve the critical size
necessary to make up for diminishing marginal revenues from individual tests due to government-imposed price reductions.
We believe that this will create opportunities for larger players, including Biogroup, to make tuck-in acquisitions to increase
their economies of scale and lab density.

**_New Technologies_**

As new technologies develop, we believe laboratories will experience pressure to upgrade their testing portfolio and adopt
new standards. The costs of compliance with new quality standards and the continual need to invest in new testing
equipment favors larger participants with greater resources available for these expenditures. This has clearly been
demonstrated since the COVID-19 outbreak when larger operators, including Biogroup, were able to make the required
investments to capture a larger part of the newly-created market.

**Competition**

We are one of the leading players in our sector within our target geographies. On an individual basis, our clinical
laboratories compete with independent clinical laboratories, hospital-based laboratories (both privately and publicly
owned) and doctor office laboratories. At a Group level, our laboratories compete with other national, European and
international groups. In general, competition stems from existing laboratories and groups as competition from new entrants
is limited due to high start-up costs as a result of stringent regulations, complex supply chain requirements and clear scale
advantages which make it hard to credibly launch testing laboratories on a small scale.

In the routine medical laboratory testing market, laboratory selection can be determined by the healthcare provider or
directly by the patient. Healthcare providers tend to base their selection on accuracy, timeliness, consistency, breadth of
tests performed and convenience (such as valuing sample pick-up services or online results platforms). Patients that are
free to select where they are tested usually base their decision on a laboratory’s proximity to their home or workplace.
Other important considerations for patients include opening hours, service quality (including waiting time and delivery of
results in expected timeframe) and the availability of online results.

As convenience and proximity to clients are paramount in winning business, and due to the regulated fee structure of the
routine laboratory testing markets, the most successful and profitable industry participants require large absolute size and
dense regional networks. The combination of these two factors allows the largest, densest players to benefit from both
significant economies of scale and higher volume throughputs leading to high margins and an ability to absorb regulatory
changes better than smaller competitors. As a result, M&A is an important factor in successfully competing within the
medical laboratory testing market. We have a strong track record of successfully acquiring and integrating smaller
independent and regional laboratories, having acquired more than 600 labs over the last five years.

The competitive landscape for the private routine laboratory testing market is different in France and in Belgium, though
we compete with local independent laboratories, regional and national/international groups across both geographies.

In France, the private medical laboratory testing market has been rapidly consolidating due to regulatory changes that have
put pressure on the profitability of smaller operators. According to the industry report, the top six players in the industry
accounted for approximately 70% of the market by value in 2019, compared to approximately 30% in 2013. We have been
at the forefront of this trend and have made a number of targeted acquisitions over the recent past to grow our scale and
profitability. As a result, according to the industry report, we are the market leader in France with approximately 20% of
total market share by value followed by Cerba (approximately 15%), Inovie (approximately 11%) and Synlab
(approximately 10%). On a regional basis, we enjoy a market-leading position in seven French regions (Grand-Est, Pays
de la Loire, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Corse, Île-de-France, PACA and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté).

In Belgium, according to the industry report, the MLT market was relatively consolidated in 2018, with the top six players
accounting for approximately 65% to 70% of market by value with different players leading across each of these regions.


-----

At a national level, we are the largest player according to the industry report, with approximately a 26% market share by
value followed by Sonic Healthcare (approximately 15%) and Synlab (approximately 8%). Within Belgium, our target
region, we are by far the largest player with an approximate market share of 26% (according to the industry report),
followed by Sonic Healthcare (approximately 15%). Our presence is limited outside of the Flanders region. Going forward,
we expect market consolidation to increase on the back of pricing pressures, which will make it more difficult for smaller
independent players to maintain existing levels of profitability. We are well placed to act as a consolidator in the Belgian
market given our size and successful M&A experience.

**COVID-19 Pandemic**

The COVID-19 crisis has had a profound impact on the medical laboratory testing market across Europe, especially in the
context of governments’ increased requirement for COVID-19 testing. We have been at the forefront of these
developments, particularly in France, where our scale and agility allowed us to react quickly to the evolving market
landscape.

**_Impact on Routine Testing Volumes_**

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March 2020, governments across Europe, including in France and
Belgium, imposed lockdowns which had a profound impact on the MLT markets’ testing volumes. According to the
industry report, between March 17 and May 11, the first period of lockdown in France, testing volumes decreased by
roughly 40% to 50% when compared to the same period in 2019. During this period, while vital tests were not impacted
(for example, tests for patients under chemotherapy, people with severe kidney failure or pregnant women), less critical,
routine tests were largely cancelled or postponed. Nevertheless, according to the industry report, strong recovery of these
routine tests post-lockdown has limited the overall loss of volumes for traditional tests to 5% to 6% over 2020 for private
MLT players in France, representing roughly €160 million to €200 million of reduced spending by CNAM.

**_COVID-19 Testing has Provided Additional Growth_**

Despite having a negative impact on the volumes of traditional tests during the lockdown, the COVID-19 crisis has had a
net positive impact on the private MLT market due to additional business requirements driven by COVID-19 testing. Three
types of COVID-19 tests are currently on the market (PCR, full serological tests and quick serological test), of which two
are performed in laboratories (PCR tests and full serological tests), while the quick serological test can be performed at
home. While the two in-lab tests are fully reimbursed by the French state, the at-home test is not covered.

PCR tests detect the presence of COVID-19 in a sample and can determine whether a patient is contagious. The test, which
uses a nasopharyngeal sample, is able to detect the virus through amplification technology and is roughly 90% accurate.
According to the industry report, the price of the PCR test is set by CNAM at €73.59 per test and has been fully reimbursed
by CNAM in full since May 11, 2020. Reimbursement policies have since been updated to require certain conditions to be
met to qualify for full reimbursement. As of December 15, 2020, PCR testing services providers in France would be directly
reimbursed by the government in full only if the test results are provided within 12 hours from testing, For example, as of
December 15, 2020, PCR testing services providers in France would be reimbursed by the government for €54.00 for the
PCR test, plus €9.60 for the collection by medical staff, €4.59 for the pre-analytical package including anti-COVID-19
protection for all staff and €5.40 for the national information database (in total, €73.59 per test) only if the test results are
provided within 12 hours from testing. If test results are provided between 12 and 24 hours after testing, testing service
providers would be reimbursed for €43.20 per test; between 24 and 48 hours, €31 per test; and after 48 hours, €0 per test.

Serological tests detect antibodies to the virus in a sample and identify immunized individuals who were infected by
COVID-19 virus at some point in the past. It uses machine detection of the antigen-antibody pair by colorimetry /
fluorescence (“ELISA5”) or luminescence (“CLIA6”) and has 99% accuracy. As per the industry report, the price per test
is fixed by CNAM at approximately €30 and has been fully reimbursed by CNAM for patients with a prescription since
May 18.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the French government has deployed these tests in scale to help contain the development
of the outbreak in the country, in particular allowing people to be tested for free without medical prescriptions or any

advance payment. According to the Direction de la Recherche, des Études, de l'Évaluation et des Statistiques ("DREES"),
as of November 15, 2020, 26 million cumulative PCR tests had been performed in France, with roughly 70% of them
conducted and processed by private MLT players.

According to the Institut National d’Assurance Maladie-Invalidité ("RIZIV/INAMI”), the Belgian government is fully
financing all three types of COVID-19 tests where patients exhibit symptoms or have a medical prescription. Per Sciensano,
Belgium’s Scientific Institute for Public Health, as of November 22, roughly 6 million of COVID-19 tests had been
performed in Belgium.

We have been at the forefront of these developments in both France and Belgium and have been able to leverage our large
installed base and advantageous geographical footprint to capture a significant share of testing volumes related to COVID19. As of November 2020, Biogroup was assisting both the French and Belgian governments in the fight to contain the
pandemic by processing approximately 21% of total French testing volumes (higher than our market share in MLT) and
approximately 12% of total Belgian testing volumes. We played a key role in performing COVID-19 tests with our ability
to deliver results faster than our competitors, and the intense media coverage highlighting us as one of the major players
of MLT markets boosted our brand awareness.

In the mid to long-term, due to the central role medical lab operators have played through the pandemic, we expect to
benefit from stronger bargaining power in future price and regulation negotiations with health authorities. In addition,
while large operators such as ours were able to make requisite investments to meet testing requirements through the crisis,
smaller labs were more constrained given the upfront costs of COVID-19 testing equipment. As such, the overall health of
smaller labs has been more negatively impacted by the crisis, which could pave the way for additional consolidation
opportunities going forward.

**Business**

**Overview**

We are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in France and Belgium, providing medical
laboratory testing services through a large and dense network of 742 collection sites across seven regions in France and in
the Flanders region in Belgium as of the date of this offering memorandum. We focus mainly on routine lab testing which
is conducted exclusively in-house and also offer specialized tests which can be performed in-house or outsourced to our
outsourcing partner, Biomnis. Our in-house testing generally comprises approximately 98% of our test volume. We
outsource only a small portion of specialized tests with low demand (thereby less profitable to invest in resources to conduct
the tests in-house). In France, our customers are mainly patients, whereas our Belgian customers are generally both doctors
and patients. Our local technical platforms also assist nearby clinics with their medical testing demands.

We perform a range of over 372 medical lab tests with varying degrees of automation, complexity and volume (including
clinical biochemistry, molecular diagnostics, infertility diagnosis, tumor marker testing, microbiology, cytology and
pathology, allergy tests and genetic tests) for patients who have either generally been prescribed these tests by their doctors
or who elect to get tested for certain non-prescribed medical tests.

We have grown our market presence in France and Belgium through acquisitions of technical platforms and large networks
of nearby collection sites in regions with attractive demographic factors (such as high density populations, aging
populations and affluence), followed by smaller bolt-on acquisitions to create density around technical platforms and ensure
maximization of operating efficiency. Through over 45 acquisitions since 2015, we have demonstrated our ability to
consistently deliver on forecast synergies and cost savings, and extract best-in-class profitability. Our founder and
shareholder Dr. Stéphane Eimer’s strategic vision and successful track record of consolidation, expertise, industry
knowledge and network, further assisted by our investors and competent management at local laboratory levels, historically
have been an important differentiator during these acquisitions, and our culture as a scientifically-led organization (driven
by ownership by a medical biologist instead of a financial sponsor) uniquely sets us apart from our competitors.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, our pro forma net sales were €1,315.2 million and our Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) was €386.2 million. See “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other
_Information—Other Financial and Operating Data.”_

**Our History**

We were founded in 1998 by Dr. Stéphane Eimer, a medical biologist, as a single laboratory in Wittelsheim, Alsace, France.
Our operations were gradually developed in the Grand Est (Greater East) region through the creation and acquisition of
collection sites before expanding into other regions of France.

In 2015, we targeted the Ile-de-France (greater Paris) region because we identified this region as growing rapidly and with
a strong potential for optimization. We acquired Biolam-LCD, the then leading independent laboratory services company
in Ile-de-France. We also acquired EX in 2016, Bioépine in 2017 and BPO, BioSynergie, Biolaboplus, Biolabs and
Bioarcades in 2018 to further strengthen our market position in this region.

In 2016 and 2017, we expanded our business in Limousin through the acquisition of Astralab and LLA and to Grand Est
region through the acquisition of Biosanté and Laboratoire Saint Rémy.

In 2018, we acquired 2A2B, then the co-leading lab testing company in Corsica, Evolab and Medilab Est in Grand Est and
Bioesterel, the leading laboratory services company in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (“PACA”).

In 2019, we further strengthened our market position by acquiring a total of 11 laboratory services companies. Among
others, we acquired laboratory testing companies in PACA (Bioazur and Biolittoral), Ile-de-France (Biomag, LBC and
Biosaga) and Grand Est (ABO Labo and GBA). We also acquired Unilians Group which was a leading laboratory services
company in Auvergne Rhône-Alpes (“AURA”).


-----

In the first half of 2020, we secured a leading position in AURA with the acquisition of Dyomedea in the central and
western regions of France (“Centre and Grand Ouest”, including the Pays de la Loire, Centre Val de Loire and Bretagne
regions) with the acquisition of Réseau Bio, Sèvre Biologie, Biomélis and Laborizon. These investments were financed in
part by Caisse de Dépôt et de Placement du Québec (“CDPQ”), which is one of our institutional investors. See “Principal
_Shareholders, Investors and Related Party Transactions”._

In October 2020, we expanded our operations to Belgian market through acquisition of eight companies of Medina Group,
which is the leading laboratory operating group in Belgium. These investments were financed in part by Intermediate
Capital Group (“ICG”), which is one of our institutional investors. In addition, Straco, which previously owned the Medina
Group, has since become one of our institutional investors by reinvesting in our Group part of its proceeds from the Medina
Acquisition. See “Principal Shareholders, Investors and Related Party Transactions”.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we operate in seven regions in France and one region in Belgium totaling
approximately 742 collection sites and 100 technical platforms (which includes 43 principal technical platforms and 11
technical platforms that specialize in assisted reproductive technology). The table below set forth the number of collection
sites, number of technical platforms (including principal technical platforms) and the respective market shares are as set
forth below:

samples collected across various collection sites in the respective region, and (ii) local technical platforms, which have limited testing
capabilities catering to the needs of nearby sites or clinics only, including for any emergency testing nearby clinics may require.

(2) Our market share in France is calculated by the total number of collection sites in the region divided by the total number of our collection sites
in the region, and is calculated per region. Our market share in Belgium is based on net sales, and is calculated as a percentage out of Belgium
market as a whole.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Present in growing and resilient markets characterized by strong fundamentals and providing further growth_**
**_opportunities_**

Our core markets are the routine outpatient private laboratory testing markets in France and Belgium. These markets
generated approximately €4.7 billion and €0.6 billion in net sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and have experienced
steady underlying growth. We believe that we benefit from resilient, non-cyclical demand for clinical diagnostics services
that delivers reliable organic growth. This growth is due in part to favorable market drivers in France and Belgium, such
as an aging population, population growth, growth in the prevalence of chronic diseases, driven by lifestyle trends such as
low levels of physical activity, poor nutrition and stress, an increase in the number of consultations per inhabitant and


-----

number of tests per consultation and increasing focus on disease prevention. We believe these factors are conducive to
increased testing frequency, driving volume growth in the market, while the essential nature of the testing services we
provide contributes to demand resilience, as exhibited during the COVID-19 pandemic by the significant increase in
volume of medical tests due to the demand for COVID-19-related testing, as well as by the gradual return of routine testing
volume to normal levels as movement and other restrictions have been lifted.

Prompt and accurate diagnostic testing improves the quality of patient care and reduces the overall cost of healthcare. As
a result, the governments in France and Belgium (which fund approximately 70% and between 70% and 100%,
respectively, of tests conducted in France and Belgium by value) have promoted the use of medical testing as preventive
care, which has led to growth in demand for medical lab testing generally. Due to the high volume of testing needs and
limited testing capacity of the public sector, public hospital laboratories have increasingly outsourced testing to private
providers. The fiscal constraints of the public sector further contribute to the private sector’s continued growth to meet the
increasing demand.

Net sales of laboratory companies in France and Belgium are subject to annual budgets established in advance through
industry-wide agreements with regulatory authorities, which set the prices for routine medical testing in advance. For
example, in France, pursuant to a triennial agreement in March 2020 with medical biologists’ labor unions (the “Current
**Triennial Plan”), the annual budget growth for medical lab tests is set for three years, and allows an increase of up to**
0.40% in 2020, 0.50% in 2021 and 0.60% in 2022. In Belgium, prices of routine tests in the private medical laboratory
testing market in Belgium are set by the national healthcare regulatory body, RIZIV/INAMI, and are revised at least on an
annual basis and historically have increased by approximately 1% per annum since 2010, with national social welfare
agency contributions roughly tracking inflation and patient contribution levels remaining stable. As a result, our net sales
are easily predictable. These annual budgets set a baseline, with prices increasing or decreasing depending on how the
market value of laboratory testing compares to the annual budgets. In addition to the government-regulated price, in
Belgium we have the option to charge the patient an additional amount, typically up to 10% of the government-regulated
price. Although these agreements create significant pricing pressure, they also protect our industry from unforeseen
external shocks, because they provide an additional budget for a predetermined level of overall market growth and to meet
the increased need for tests during an exceptional event.

The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates how this system works. Regulatory authorities in France and Belgium have provided
an additional budget for COVID-19-related tests separate from its annual budget for lab testing. Moreover, the decrease in
routine medical lab testing during COVID-19 pandemic, which will likely place market value below the annual budget,
may in fact lead to a price increase for medical lab tests we perform, subject to negotiation with our regulators.

We expect that the increased demand for COVID-19-related testing activity (such as polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”)
and serology testing), which had not previously contributed to the market value of traditional medical laboratory testing
services, will continue to provide significant additional upside to lab operators in the short term. In the long-term, our
incremental PCR testing capacity can be used for tests to detect non-COVID-19-related infectious diseases, such as
microbiology tests, which we expect will mitigate future decreases in PCR testing volumes. We also expect routine testing
volumes to increase from greater public familiarity with diagnostic testing and its benefits, as well as the emergence of
new tests in the “routine” segment of the market. Moreover, the increased public awareness of the central importance of
medical laboratory testing services resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may benefit medical laboratory testing
providers in future price negotiations with the relevant regulatory authorities. We believe we are well placed to benefit
from these trends, because we are one of the few private testing providers in France and Belgium that are capable of
providing PCR testing, due to our advanced equipment used to perform PCR tests. We currently perform one of the largest
shares of PCR testing in France and Belgium.

For a further discussion of our markets and their underlying competitive dynamics, see “Industry”.

**_Leading market position driving strong historical growth and EBITDA margin_**

We are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in both of our core markets, France and
Belgium. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, we generated pro forma net sales of €1,315.2 million, including
net sales of €1,138.6 million in France (including CBM25) and €176.7 million of pro forma net sales in Belgium through


-----

Medina Group, which we acquired in October 2020. As a large incumbent operator in France and Belgium, we are able to
leverage significant economies of scale both (i) financially, benefitting from strong negotiating positions with key suppliers
and (ii) operationally, through our ability to react quickly and at scale to respond to regulatory or other changes, such as
our rapid roll-out of COVID-19-related PCR testing capabilities at the start of the pandemic. These attributes have allowed
us to deliver a best-in-class Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) margin of 33.4% for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2020.

Through our large-scale and successful consolidation of smaller operators, we have developed a network of approximately
742 collection sites across France and Belgium with the capacity to deliver up to 153,000 tests per day as of September
2020. Moreover, we have historically experienced very low churn among our medical biologists. Biologists at acquired
laboratories are incentivized to remain within our Group following the acquisition and integration of targets due to a
combination of financial, structural and cultural factors, such as our profit sharing system, the decentralized management
of each laboratory site, which leverages centralized regional technical platform capabilities to achieve cost savings, and
the fact that we are owned and managed by Dr. Stéphane Eimer, a medical biologist. This low churn has historically
provided us with substantial institutional knowledge at both the local and regional levels, promoting continuity and
operational efficiency as new targets are integrated into our Group’s network on an ongoing basis.

We have executed our consolidation strategy with discipline and speed, having successfully integrated over 45 acquisitions
since 2015. The chart below sets forth the growth in the number of our collection sites since Laboratoire Eimer was founded
in 1998.

Our consolidation strategy has allowed us to generate, on a compounded basis, an annual pro forma net sales growth rate
of over 60% and an annual pro forma EBITDA growth rate of over 70% from 2015 to 2019, demonstrating the effectiveness
of scale in enhancing our financial performance. A key factor in ensuring EBITDA margins are effectively extracted from
new acquisitions is our ability to quickly manage staff costs (mainly by substituting part of the cash compensation of
biologists at the newly acquired laboratory with equity), supplier costs (through application of the terms of our existing
framework agreements immediately after closing and post-acquisition reagent price renegotiations with suppliers
benefiting from the Group’s increased scale) and other operating costs of target labs in order to rapidly realize operating
synergies.

**_Integrated and efficient business model with a dense network of collection sites covering a wide range of diagnostic_**
**_applications in-house_**

We believe our integrated network model allows us to benefit from significant cost savings and a high utilization rate of
our technical platforms, which leads to greater profitability. We have focused on building a series of dense networks in
each of the geographic regions we have chosen to enter, leveraging a “hub-and-spoke” network model of distributed
collection sites clustered tightly around state-of-the-art, well-invested technical platforms with, in our view, the latest and
most efficient equipment. With an average of 65 collection sites per region in France (by categorizing our operating regions
into a total of 11 regions in France), as compared to a competitor average of 30, we are able to centralize sample analysis
of a large number of collection sites around each of our best-in-class technical platforms to achieve cost savings and
optimize the utilization rate for each platform.


-----

We have focused strategically on regions within France that exhibit attractive fundamental demographic characteristics,
such as rapidly growing or aging populations, metropolitan areas with above-average population density and relative
affluence. These areas, such as Ile-de-France, Auvergne Rhône-Alpes and the PACA regions, drive higher testing volumes
than more rural or less affluent regions and consequently enable us to operate at greater levels of efficiency with faster test
turnaround speeds and higher margins. In line with this strategy, we entered the Belgian market through our acquisition of
the Medina Group in October 2020, which is located in densely populated areas, thus enabling a high level of operational
efficiency.

We cover all of the routine laboratory testing phases in-house, from initial collection of samples from patients or healthcare
providers to post-analytical biological validation and results reporting. Approximately 93% of our pro forma net sales in
2019 were derived from our testing services that are conducted in-house. Our strong in-house analytical capabilities
(including our innovative testing automation capabilities enabled by best-in-class equipment), combined with our dense
network of collection sites located in close proximity to technical platforms, allow us to optimize our operations and achieve
a quick turnaround of testing results with fewer staff. We estimate that we revert with test results within 12 hours for a
majority of tests. We also offer a comprehensive service across a wide scope of medical tests, including clinical chemistry,
hematology, allergy, microbiology, immunochemistry, molecular diagnostics, cytology and fertility tests. See “Business—
_Our Business—Overview” for more information._

Furthermore, for our operations in France in particular, we believe that our strategic focus on the B2C routine lab segment
and limited exposure to outsourced testing drive our EBITDA margin outperformance. By concentrating on B2C routine
lab testing (which generally generates a higher margin than B2B) and maintaining limited outsourcing (which is generally
more expensive than in-house testing), we benefit from greater profitability than some of our peers that have a B2B business
model and/or outsource a greater proportion of tests. We generally perform approximately 98% of our analysis by volume
in-house, and outsource only a small portion of testing to our outsourcing partner, Biomnis, for certain specialized tests
with low demand (and therefore less profitable to invest in resources to conduct the tests in-house). If an outsourced test
becomes sufficiently recurrent, we may decide to make an investment and purchase or lease the necessary equipment and
hire the appropriate staff to be able to perform the test in-house. See “Business—Our Business” for more information.

Finally, our centralized procurement function and limited number of suppliers allow us to better absorb pricing pressures
and improve profitability. We generally engage only one or two suppliers per service and type of purchase, who provide
the relevant service and products nationally to our collection sites and technical platforms. This centralization helps our
group-level procurement team negotiate better terms with our reagent and equipment suppliers pursuant to master supply
agreements, which also benefit our acquired targets post-acquisition. This approach allows us to achieve a competitive net
sales margin while harmonizing best practices across our network. See “Business—Our Suppliers” for more information.

**_Incumbent leadership position strengthened by significant barriers to entry_**

We believe that our competitive position is bolstered by several significant barriers to entry for private medical lab testing
market in France and Belgium.

We operate in a highly regulated industry with stringent, complex mandatory operating license accreditation frameworks.
These requirements can be onerous for providers without a critical scale in the market to support the resources necessary
to achieve and maintain compliance, creating an environment naturally conducive to consolidation. We are subject to
onerous licensing and certification regimes, particularly in Belgium where there is a de facto stop on the granting of new
licenses, thus making it difficult to increase the number of new licenses. We collaborate closely with regulators to stay up–
to-date with the latest regulatory developments in the markets where we operate. For our French operations in particular,
our Quality Director is also a member of COFRAC (Comité français d’accréditation), which supervises French laboratories
to ensure that they are up–to-date on regulatory requirements. Our relationship with COFRAC provides us with a significant
advantage compared to new entrants, particularly with respect to obtaining accreditation under the new accreditation
requirement pursuant to the more rigorous ISO 15189 standard, under which we plan to apply for 100% accreditation by
the April 30, 2021 deadline; we aim to obtain accreditation under the ISO 9001 standard by 2023. In our Belgian operations,
all of our collection sites and technical platforms are accredited under the relevant quality standards issued by Sciensano,
Belgium’s Scientific Institute for Public Health. All but one of our collection sites in Belgium have obtained the BELAC
accreditation in line with the ISO 15189 standard. See “Business—Quality Standards” for more information.


-----

Moreover, the constraints on ownership of laboratory companies in France are burdensome to potential market entrants, in
particular overseas investors, making it more difficult to achieve scale or establish a new business. French law requires inhouse biologists to retain a majority of voting rights and, subject to certain exceptions, share capital of the subsidiaries they
own. Generally, our acquisition targets’ biologists will retain some equity interest post-acquisition. See “Business—Our
_Corporate Structure (SEL/SELAS)” and “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure” for more information._

Our “hub-and-spoke” network model further allows us to leverage economies of scale. We operate in several regions
through a combination of multiple collection sites serviced by a centralized technical platform where tests are actually
performed, which allows us to reduce our fixed costs (comprised largely of staff and facilities costs) and deliver a broad
range of testing services at a lower cost per unit than a new entrant is likely to be able to achieve. This scale also gives us
negotiating power to procure reagents and equipment on more advantageous terms, as well as in M&A processes.

Further, our industry know-how and deep scientific expertise, combined with our dense network of collection sites, allow
us to deliver diagnostic testing services quickly and accurately at the convenience of the customers. Convenience (including
proximity for individual patients, our main customers in France), fast turnaround and quality of testing results are important
factors for patients and doctors (our main customers in Belgium) in selecting laboratories. As an incumbent already
equipped with experienced biologists across multiple regions and state-of-the-art technical platforms with the latest
technology that can handle large testing volumes efficiently, we have been able to promptly deliver testing results for a
broad range of routine lab tests.

Our successful track record and our strong reputation also act as powerful barriers to entry. Developing a reputation for
convenience and quality takes time to build, and we believe Biogroup’s strong reputation (including the strength of our
subsidiaries’ reputations, such as Medina Group) in diagnostic services in France and Belgium enables us to attract
customers, staff and potential acquisition targets over competitors, ensuring that our testing volumes, skill and technical
capabilities are maintained and grow over time. The high-volume nature of the routine laboratory testing business requires
substantial managerial and organizational competence to implement high quality standards throughout the network. Our
decentralized management structure allows for best practices to be identified based on local experience, while our scale
and infrastructure allow for best practices to be shared and implemented across the Group. Our fast turnaround in delivering
test results and the convenience of the proximity of testing sites to patients, due to our existing dense network in the regions
we operate, also provide a significant advantage over new entrants. Moreover, for our Belgian operations, we believe that
our commitment to building and maintaining relationships with doctors, is also integral to continuing to grow our market
share. Doctors tend to return to their existing preferred laboratory services provider as a one-stop shop for all of the analyses
they need for their patients, and our existing relationship with these customers makes it more difficult for entrants to
penetrate. Lastly, our profile has increased significantly as a result of our COVID-19 testing response due in part to
increased media coverage, which will be difficult for other entrants to establish in the short-term.

**_Established consolidation strategy with disciplined acquisition criteria_**

We have a strong track record as a preeminent consolidator in the French diagnostic testing space. Through over 45
acquisitions since 2015, we have demonstrated an ability to consistently deliver on forecast synergies and effectively
integrate newly acquired laboratories with speed and efficiency. We maintain a proven and established M&A policy,
drawing on the experience and track record of our senior leadership team to facilitate rapid decision making through a
standardized M&A process.

The consolidation strategy that we have pursued since 2015 has been a balance of speed with discipline. We have deployed
a tactical roll-up approach on a region-by-region basis, focusing on establishing technical platform hubs in new,
strategically attractive geographic regions meeting certain criteria (including the demographic factors described above),
balanced with smaller bolt-on acquisitions to create density around the technical platform and ensure maximization of
operating efficiency. Our decentralized management model also allow us to leverage our local management’s knowledge
and relationships in the regions in which we operate to source potential acquisitions and optimize post-acquisition
integration measures, such as opening new collection sites in the best locations based on their local knowledge and
harmonization of network. We also benefit from their existing relationship with local governmental bodies and regional
health agencies.


-----

The potential for synergies and cost savings with our existing technical platform and laboratory network is an important
criteria for our selection of targets for future acquisitions. We have a successful track record of achieving synergies and
cost savings due in part to our systematic approach of promptly integrating targets into our centralized framework
agreements, the majority of which we are able to achieve between the first day following the closing of the acquisition and
within a few weeks thereafter. For example, our acquisitions of Bioesterel in December 2018 and Biolittoral in June 2019
both resulted in EBITDA margin increases which exceeded our initial target margin. See “Business—Our Growth through
_Acquisitions” for more information on the increases in EBITDA margin. We have our targets accede to our supplier master_
agreements as soon as possible post-acquisition, which allows the targets to benefit from our existing competitive price
and fee arrangements soon after an acquisition has been completed. We also selectively conduct certain tests previously
outsourced by the target in-house, outsourcing those that remain to Biomnis, benefitting from our existing contractual
outsourcing arrangements at a competitive margin. See “Business—Our Growth through Acquisitions” for more
information.

In addition, we believe that the French regulatory regime governing the ownership of laboratory companies aligns the
interests of our Group and our targets and minimizes churn of senior-level specialized biologists at the target level. The
biologists’ retention of an equity stake at the target level also prevents disruption of the target’s business post-acquisition
and facilitates the post-acquisition integration process.

In evaluating transactions, we seek to benchmark pricing against prevailing market conditions at the time, while taking into
account the size and strategic significance of any given acquisition. When assessing a potential target, we generally consider
those within a range of applicable EBITDA multiples which depends on the size of the target’s business. With smaller
targets, we pursue acquisitions at lower EBITDA multiples, whereas for larger targets, we would consider paying a higher
EBITDA multiple.

**_Strong, resilient financial performance bolstered by high margins and strong cash flow generation_**

We have a strong track record of growth, with our annual pro forma revenue growth growing over 60% from 2015 to 2019.
From 2018 to 2019, we have generated organic net sales growth of 2% in France and 3-4% in Belgium from 2010 to 2018,
exceeding that of the overall market (approximately 0.8% from 2014 to 2019 in France and 2-3% from 2010 to 2018 in
Belgium) due in part to our structural exposure to regions exhibiting greater organic growth in testing volumes. Our
historical organic growth in Ile-de-France, the largest market in France, was 2.8% from 2016 to 2019, which was well
above the market average of 1.1% from 2014 to 2019.

Our above-market organic growth trajectory has been supported by our strategy of selectively investing in geographic
regions that exhibit attractive demographic characteristics, such as rapidly growing or aging populations, metropolitan
areas with above-average population density and relative affluence. Within each of the geographic regions we have chosen
to enter, we have built a dense network of collection sites which leverage centralized regional technical platform
capabilities to achieve cost savings. Our scale and infrastructure allow us to achieve economies of scale in negotiating with
suppliers, while allowing us to survey a broad array of best practices which are adopted across the Group.

Our efficient operational approach has allowed us to generate Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact)
of €386.2 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 and a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID19 impact) margin of 33.4% during the same time period, which we believe to have outperformed our peers in our core
markets.

Our business has maintained stable margins and cash conversion over a number of years, despite significant growth. Our
Adjusted EBITDA margins were 31.0%, 27.7% and 29.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019,
respectively. Our adjusted free cash flow, which we calculate as Adjusted EBITDA less changes in net working capital
and net capital expenditure, was €61.4 million, €67.6 million, €165.9 million and €158.8 million for the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. Our cash flow
performance was also strong, with EBITDA representing 74% of our net cash flow from operating activities for the year
ended December 31, 2019, due to our structurally negative working capital profile and limited capital expenditure (2.2%
of net sales generated during 2019). Our cash flow conversion ratio, which we calculate as our adjusted free cash flow as


-----

a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA, was 87.5%, 70.0%, 92.2% and 63.7% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018
and 2019 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.

In addition, we typically do not acquire any diagnostic instrumentation (except for PCR testing equipment, which we
purchased in March 2020 in response to increasing demand due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic) and lease our
equipment from our reagent suppliers. See “Business—Our Suppliers” for more information. This approach benefits us by
limiting ongoing maintenance capital expenditures.

**_Highly experienced and agile management team with an entrepreneurial spirit supported by committed shareholders_**
**_and investors_**

We have an experienced management team with substantial scientific and commercial experience in the diagnostic testing
sector. Our majority shareholder, Chairman and CEO, Dr. Stéphane Eimer, is a trained pharmacist and medical biologist
who founded Laboratoire Eimer in 1998 and maintains control over our operations.

Our senior leadership and culture (driven by a medical biologist instead of a financial sponsor) distinguishes us from our
competitors. Dr. Eimer’s strategic vision and long and successful track record of consolidation have helped drive our
growth. His knowledge and reputation among other biologists in the industry have historically been an important
differentiator during our M&A processes, compared with certain sponsor-backed peers. Dr. Eimer’s deep and long-standing
relationships with suppliers allow us to benefit from competitive margins under our supply agreements. For more
information about our management, see “Management”. Dr. Eimer’s strategy is also to cultivate strong management teams
at the local level. Our network of regional management teams, incentivized with minority shareholdings in their respective
laboratories, further provide strength and depth of experience at each level of the Group and ensure high quality and
consistency of operational initiatives across our Group. We believe that our corporate infrastructure provides the necessary
framework for improving performance and sharing best practices across our network. Our senior and regional management
structure has allowed us to retain our culture as a scientifically-led organization and promote our reputation as the provider
of choice in the routine outpatient diagnostic testing market in France and Belgium.

Our de-centralized governance structure across our network also allows us to make agile investment decisions, thereby
enabling us to achieve a high rate of successful completed acquisitions. This agility has been recently demonstrated in our
response to the emergence of COVID-19, where our management team ramped up the installation of PCR testing
equipment, securing a cornerstone position in the provision of testing in France and an approximate 20% market share of
all COVID-19 tests in France (public and private) as of the week of November 2, 2020. As of January 10, 2021, we have
performed more than 6.9 million PCR tests and 0.7 million serology tests for COVID-19 in France (including tests
performed by companies acquired in 2020 prior to their acquisition date), and as of the end of December 2020, we had
performed approximately 0.8 million PCR tests and 0.1 million serology tests in Belgium.

Moreover, we are supported by blue-chip institutional investors who share the long-term strategic objectives of the
management team and bring substantial experience in operating in the healthcare sector. We maintain regular
communication with our key institutional investors, CDPQ, ICG and Straco, who have approval rights with respect to
external acquisitions and financings that exceed a certain level. See “Principal Shareholders, Investors and Related Party
_Transactions—Key Institutional Investors”._

**Our Strategy**

**_Selectively pursue acquisitions_**

We are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in France and, since the Medina Acquisition,
in Belgium, operating in seven regions in France and in the Flanders region in Belgium. The laboratory testing markets in
both France and Belgium remain fragmented, and we regularly identify numerous near and medium term potential
consolidation opportunities in both markets. We therefore plan to continue expanding our footprint within all of these
regions through acquisitions and increasing the density of collection sites serving existing and additional technical
platforms, reinforcing our “hub-and-spoke” network model.


-----

We expect acquisitions in the regions in which we are already present to be primarily small- and mid-sized bolt-on
acquisitions that can quickly and effectively be integrated into our existing network infrastructure to realize significant
operating synergies and cost savings at these sites. We will closely appraise potential targets based on their location relative
to our existing facilities, as well as other factors, including customer accessibility. We will prioritize sites that we believe
will help drive testing volume growth for our technical platforms and further increase our market share. We will also
leverage our local medical biologists’ knowledge of the market and their relationships with the management of potential
targets. We aim to finance such bolt-on acquisitions with our organic free cash flow.

We also intend to expand into new regions in France and Belgium which fit specific demographic criteria that we believe
will drive increasing testing volumes, such as regions with rapidly growing or aging populations, metropolitan areas with
above-average population density and relative affluence. Acquisitions in new regions are likely to focus on mid-sized to
larger targets that we believe will provide us with sufficient scale and both local collection sites and technical platforms.
Once such acquisitions are completed and our operations are integrated, we may seek to further consolidate our position
and enhance network density through smaller bolt-on acquisitions.

Moreover, we continue to selectively assess potential acquisition opportunities in other European markets which we believe
present attractive demographic characteristics and opportunities to develop a significant scale of lab testing operations by
leveraging our experience in France and Belgium. Acquisitions in new markets are likely to be mid- to large-size
transactions.

**_Drive organic volume growth across our markets and raise brand recognition_**

Our goal is to continue delivering organic growth superior to the growth of the markets in which we operate. We intend to
achieve this through our continued focus on operational excellence and improved customer experience and satisfaction. In
particular, we believe that the continued development of our established laboratory network will further foster successful
organic growth and help us to maintain and expand on the established relationships we hold with key stakeholders across
the industry.

We continue to monitor our geographic footprint closely to ensure that our portfolio is distributed in accordance with our
strategic criteria. Areas of higher density, aging population and affluence will be targeted for greater investment and
improvement, with a particular focus on sites offering enhanced customer convenience and other characteristics that will
help continue to drive volume growth.

We further intend to remain alert to changing trends in testing patterns and ready to respond quickly where these trends are
identified. We remain open to the selective expansion of our testing portfolio within our wider strategy of maintaining a
primary focus on routine B2C testing. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, there is potential for a step-change in public
attitudes toward diagnostic testing and, as demonstrated by our initial reaction to the emergence of the virus, we are able
to respond quickly as these trends are identified to ensure that we continue to provide a comprehensive end-to-end
diagnostic testing service.

Finally, our profile has increased significantly as a result of our COVID-19 testing response and we plan to use this as a
platform to further develop customer awareness, establish solid branding and reputation and promote public understanding
of us and our service offering to drive additional B2C volumes.

**_Continue to deliver operating efficiencies and maintain best-in-class margins_**

We will continue to maintain our established growth trajectory in line with our historical acquisitions, and leverage the
economies of scale that historical and future acquisitions can deliver. Our scale is our core differentiator in France and
Belgium and the source of our primary competitive advantage over smaller peers. Our size allows us to benefit from
operational and supply chain efficiencies and to survey a broad landscape for best practices, which we can then benchmark
and adopt across our network. Our market leadership and culture (driven by a medical biologist controlling ownership
instead of a financial investor) also helps us attract and retain high quality staff and serves as a competitive differentiator
in M&A processes.


-----

We will continue to enhance our internal logistical and procurement networks and aim to operate as efficiently as possible
in the delivery of our services. Our strategy is to use a limited number of suppliers per service and type of purchase for the
Group. This selection process allows us to choose the best supplier for each type of analysis and to obtain optimized
purchasing conditions through economies of scale. Our procurement partner framework agreements will be revisited from
time to time to ensure they continue bringing the best value for our Group as we continue to grow in scale, and our logistical
arrangements will respond to the increasing scope of our network to ensure that our operating and financial performance
is maintained.

We will continue our strategy of maximizing our operational efficiency, through our dense networks of collection sites
located in close proximity to technical platforms, which enable us to centralize our testing equipment and professionals at
technical platforms, reduce our overhead costs and, consequently, maintain our high EBITDA margin. Moreover, we will
maintain our focus on providing customers with convenience in terms of proximity to our collection sites, fast and accurate
testing results (we estimate that we revert with test results within 12 hours for a majority of tests) and flexible opening
hours. We will also continue to minimize our logistics costs through our hub-and-spoke model, which enables us to achieve
quick turnaround of testing results.

Although we anticipate our net sales to experience downward pressure in the near term as a result of regulatory pricing
pressure in our markets, we have a long track record and significant experience in managing pricing pressure and we remain
confident that our above-market organic volume growth trajectory and consistent operating cost control will continue to
mitigate this to deliver stable or near-stable EBITDA margins and free cash flow in the short to medium term. By leveraging
our dense network, strategically placed in metropolitan areas with higher demand for medical testing due to their
demographics, we expect to sustain sufficient volume growth with low staff costs, allowing us to resist against pricing
pressure in the future.

In line with our historical acquisitions, we will focus on adding scale without reducing post-synergy and cost savings
EBITDA margins for future acquisitions. We will aim to maintain a track record of meeting or exceeding forecast synergies
and cost savings with our future acquisitions, by implementing agile integration strategies and adopting efficiency measures
between the first day of integration and within a few weeks from closing.

**_Encourage the sharing of best practices internally to provide the highest quality service_**

As one of the market-leading providers of testing services, we have developed a reputation for operational excellence. One
of our key differentiators is that our ownership and management structure fosters our culture as a scientifically-led
organization that promotes the sharing of best practices within our Group. Our corporate infrastructure provides the
necessary framework for sharing best practices across our network, through “best practice” committees organized by topic
and supervised by our Quality department, to ensure such practices are benchmarked and adopted across our network. In
so doing, we aim to uniformly promote new investments in technologies and logistical innovation.

We constantly monitor and aim to improve our systems and processes, and plan to develop and upgrade our operating and
diagnostic systems to maintain high quality standards and deliver increased operational excellence and efficiency. For
example, we are actively exploring how increased automation can be incorporated into the end-to-end testing process and,
through our “best practice” committees, we plan to establish, benchmark and then implement new operating standards for
roll-out across our Group. These committees are also expected to build on the experience, including in crisis management
and operational optimization, we gained during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that we are best prepared
to respond to other potential challenges in the future. For example, we have benefited from sharing knowledge through
these committees on the best performing PCR testing equipment, as well as brand selection and alternative sourcing options
for reagents, masks and swabs, which has enhanced our ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and other future
pandemics or similar crises.

**Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic**

**_Overview_**

As a leading provider of medical laboratory testing, we believe we provide a vital service to the healthcare systems and
general public in France and Belgium during the COVID-19 pandemic to help fight against the virus.

We are working closely with French and Belgian government health authorities to use our PCR and serology testing
capabilities to help combat the virus. We have been granted the status of critical national infrastructure in France and
Belgium by their respective governments, which allows all of our key collection sites and technical platforms to remain
open and operational in order for us to meet the demand for our services during the lock-down periods.

The significant additional net sales from the large volume of PCR and serology tests we have performed since March 2020
in France and Belgium has resulted in strong cash generation and our increased ability to deleverage. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2020, we generated €184.6 million of pro forma net sales from COVID-19-related PCR and serology
tests, accounting for 21.4% of the Group’s pro forma net sales for the same period. This increase in our pro forma net sales
more than offset the decline of 4.7% in our pro forma net sales from our regular medical testing operations in France and
Belgium due to the government-mandated lockdowns and decrease in patients’ demand for routine testing as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. This also had a positive impact on our EBITDA, with our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 at €454.4 million and 35.1%,
respectively, compared to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
(excluding COVID-19 impact) margin of €386.2 million and 33.4% for the same period.

In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we have exceeded our 2020 budget for PCR tests forecasted in March 2020 from 2.5
million tests to 6.4 million tests performed. See “Summary—Other Financial Data” for more information.

We believe that, in the short term, market growth in COVID-19-related tests will significantly counterbalance the negative
impact of the temporary decrease in volumes of other routine testing. The French and Belgian private medical lab testing
industry has proven its resilience, and we are currently seeing a gradual return to normal levels of activity in the routine
testing market. We are optimistic that, in the medium to long term, the easing of population confinement measures and the
return of normal economic activity in France and Belgium will result in our business fully returning to its normal levels.
Moreover, the Current Triennial Plan by the French government for the period between 2020 through 2022 provides some
market growth and earnings visibility until December 2022. In Belgium, we expect the government budget allocated to
medical testing expenditures will increase as a result of an increase in the Fixed Sum of the medical test price by 1% and
an increase in the variable portion of the medical test price calculated with B-Value by 0.8% in 2021 compared to those
budgets for 2020. The exact allocation between the private medical laboratory testing market and the public market to be
published and implemented at a later date. See “Industry” for more information on Fixed Sum and B-Value.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, it is not possible to accurately predict the near-, medium- or long-term impact
of COVID-19 on our business and our industry, the timing and the extent, if any, of the changes in policies on
reimbursement of COVID-19 tests and government policies in connection with the testing requirements for employees for
COVID-19, and the availability of a vaccine against COVID-19 in France and Belgium remain uncertain. See “Risks
_Related to Our Industry—The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has caused severe disruptions in_
_the global economy and financial markets which could adversely affect our business”. We will continue monitoring and_
working closely with the authorities as necessary as the COVID-19 pandemic develops.

**_PCR and serology testing capabilities_**

We believe we have the largest PCR testing capacity in France and Belgium as of the date of this offering memorandum.
As of November 2020, we believe we are capable of performing approximately 20% of PCR tests nationally in France, and
approximately between 12% and 15% of PCR tests nationally in Belgium. As of November 2020, we perform
approximately 21% and 12% of the total weekly PCR tests in France and Belgium, respectively.


-----

As of January 10, 2021, we have performed more than 6.9 million PCR tests and 0.7 million serology tests for COVID-19
in France (including tests performed by companies acquired in 2020 prior to their acquisition date), and as of the end of
December 2020, we had performed 0.8 million PCR tests and 0.1 million serology tests in Belgium.

We invested in PCR testing equipment in March 2020, which allowed us to gain significant testing capacity early on. We
have installed relevant PCR testing capacity in the largest epidemic clusters in France, enabling us to meet the substantial
demand of COVID-19-related testing, in particular with respect to the “second wave” in the Île-de-France and AURA
regions, where Biogroup has a large market share. We have also installed drive-in locations and dedicated testing spaces
next to our labs, which have mostly been allowed by local authorities to organize massive COVID-19 testing and to increase
visibility for new customers in France. In France, patients are tested free of charge without a medical prescription, and we
are paid directly by the French national health insurance. Following the acquisition of the Medina Group, we have assisted
our Belgian laboratories to increase their weekly PCR testing capacity from approximately 15% of tests performed in
Belgium in October 2020 to approximately 20% of tests performed in Belgium to date, based on our management estimates.

We are able to utilize our existing equipment for COVID-19-related serology testing. We have increased capital
expenditure in 2020 in connection with the purchase of additional machines at our principal and secondary technical
platforms in order to perform high volumes of PCR tests while limiting patients’ wait time for results. Our capital
expenditure in connection with our new PCR testing capabilities was €18 million during the nine months ended September
30, 2020. Our costs for PCR test and serology test included the cost of reagent, logistics costs, other costs (such as additional
personal protective equipment (such as gloves and masks)), and staff-related costs (such as temporary hiring and COVID19 bonuses).

We have experienced a marginal increase in operational expenditures in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly
due to increased logistics costs in connection with the delivery of equipment and reagents during the initial lockdown and
additional protective equipment, as well as an increase in part-time employees for PCR and serology test sample collection
and analysis. We have implemented enhanced on-site safety measures and procedures applicable to our employees and
administrative staffs and expanded existing flexible work policies such as working from home and video conferencing.

**_Reimbursement Policies in France and Belgium_**

As of September 30, 2020, our cost of reimbursement per PCR test was €73.59 in France and €46.81 in Belgium. As of
September 30, 2020, our cost of reimbursement per serology test was approximately €30 in France and Belgium. While
the French and Belgian governments have reimbursed the testing services provider the costs of PCR tests in full in the past,
their reimbursement policies have since been updated to require certain conditions to be met to qualify for full
reimbursement, and their reimbursement policies may further change from time to time. For example, as of December 15,
2020, PCR testing services providers in France would be reimbursed by the government for €54.00 for the PCR test, plus
€9.60 for the collection by medical staff, €4.59 for the pre-analytical package including anti-COVID-19 protection for all
staff and €5.40 for the national information database (in total, €73.59 per test) only if the test results are provided within
12 hours from testing. If test results are provided between 12 and 24 hours after testing, testing service providers would be
reimbursed for €43.20 per test; between 24 and 48 hours, €31 per test; and after 48 hours, €0 per test. Moreover, the Belgian
government announced in October 2020 that reimbursement may only be made for patients with prescriptions, which has
and may continue to significantly reduce the number of tests per week in the country. Any further changes in the policies
that may reduce the demand or volume of the COVID-19-related tests would have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry—
_The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has caused severe disruptions in the global economy and_
_financial markets which could adversely affect our business.”_

**_Other COVID-19 Related Initiatives_**

We are also supporting businesses in France by providing “back to workplace” testing for their employees. For example,
we have been engaged by several large corporate clients to provide PCR and serology tests for their employees and for
family members of employees who have been exposed to COVID-19. Our services in this context form part of larger
corporate strategies to facilitate employees’ return to the workplace.

**Our Corporate Structure (SEL/SELAS)**

As of December 31, 2020, Holdco is an SAS incorporated under French law that holds 10.87% of the share capital, 10.88%
of the voting rights and 89.06% of the financial rights of Laboratoire Eimer.

Dr. Stéphane Eimer, our founder and a medical biologist, together with his child, holds (i) 100% of the share capital, voting
rights and financial rights of Holdco; (ii) 100% of the share capital, voting rights and financial rights of SE Finance; and
(iii) directly and indirectly through Holdco and SE Finance, and together with Dr. Eimer’s spouse’s direct shareholding,
81.60% of the share capital, 81.69% of the voting rights and 5.95% of the financial rights of Laboratoire Eimer. As a result,
Dr. Eimer and his family members hold most of the voting rights, directly or through Holdco and SE Finance, in Laboratoire
Eimer, while in-house medical biologists and other minority shareholders hold the remaining shareholding in Laboratoire
Eimer. For more information on financial rights, voting rights, the share capital structure of our Group and our shareholders,
see “Principal Shareholders, Investors and Related Party Transactions” and “Summary Corporate and Financing
_Structure”._ Upon conversion and redemption of all bonds redeemable into preferred shares of Holdco outstanding and held
by our investors as of the date of this offering memorandum, Dr. Eimer, together with his family members and through SE
Finance, would hold 52.33% of the share capital and voting rights and 42.70% of the financial rights of Holdco (with the
remainder of the share capital, voting rights and financial rights of Holdco held by our institutional investors), and would
hold 87.30% of the share capital and 87.38% of the voting rights and 43.98% of the financial rights of Laboratoire Eimer.

Laboratoire Eimer, which is incorporated as a SELAS under French law, owns 99.99% of the share capital, 49.63% of the
voting rights and 99.99% of financial rights in CAB, with the remainder being held by medical biologists and other minority
shareholders. Certain members of senior management may also invest in CAB pursuant to the existing, or any future,
management incentive plan. See “Management” for more information.

We primarily conduct our business through our subsidiaries in France and Belgium, which we own through CAB, which
is incorporated as a SELAS under French law. Our laboratory companies in France are subject to ownership restrictions
under the relevant French law. French law limits persons who are not medical biologists and entities that are not laboratory
companies from holding, in aggregate, more than 25% of a laboratory company’s share capital and voting rights. Moreover,
external medical biologist and entities that are laboratory companies cannot hold, in aggregate, more than 49.99% of the
share capital and 49.99% of the voting rights in a laboratory company, unless they are incorporated as “5.1” laboratory
companies pursuant to an exception. “5.1” laboratory companies in France (including CAB and certain subsidiaries of our
Group) are allowed to have (i) external medical biologist and entities that are laboratory companies to hold, in aggregate,
up to 99.99% of the share capital and 49.99% of the voting rights in such laboratory company and (ii) transfers of the
securities of such laboratory company to be subject to a legal right of first refusal from the in-house medical biologists.
Officers of French laboratory companies must be in-house medical biologists and at least two-thirds of the members of an
executive board or a supervisory board of French laboratory companies must be practicing in-house medical biologists.
French law also requires that medical laboratories must take the corporate form of a SEL (unless they are organized as a
non-profit organization, or a _société civile professionnelle (“SCP”), a cooperative undertaking or operated by an_
individual). As a result, although practicing medical biologists typically own less than 10% of the financial rights in our
respective laboratories (except in certain situations where founders still have significant stakes), they always hold at least
50.01% of the voting rights. Moreover, medical biologists must, under French law, be allowed to exercise their independent
judgment in the conduct of their day-to-day operations. For more information on the regulations affecting the corporate
form and ownership of French medical laboratories, see “Regulation—France—Laboratory Ownership and Corporate
_Structure.”_

As a result, we do not have de jure control over our French subsidiaries and we are dependent on the consents from the
medical biologists who hold the majority of the voting rights in, and those that are officers entitled to act on behalf of, our
French subsidiaries, for decisions affecting these laboratory subsidiaries’ operations. However, our existing shareholders
agreement, bylaws and articles of associations with each of our laboratory companies allow us to implement key
management decisions decided at the Group level, while maintaining the independence of our medical biologists for dayto-day operational decisions in compliance with French law. Pursuant to the respective bylaws, main shareholders of each
company of the Group are entitled to receive from the representative of such company prior notice of all major operating
decisions of our laboratory companies, including the incurrence of debt over a specified threshold, corporate mergers,
yearly budgeting, entering into contracts with a term over one year or a value greater than a specified amount. In case there


-----

is a disagreement among our local management and our Group management in relation to major operating decisions, we
are entitled to subject such decisions to a shareholder vote. As we hold a significant (though non-controlling) stake in the
voting rights of our laboratory subsidiaries, we believe that we are able to secure a majority with the support from a portion
of in-house medical biologists to ensure that key management decisions decided by the Group management are accepted,
or operating decisions that are not seen as favorable to the Group are not adopted. As of the date of this offering
memorandum, we have not experienced any disagreement with local management or officers with respect to
implementation of the Group’s strategy and decisions and we have not exercised our shareholder rights in such context.
We enter into a similar shareholders agreement with each of our newly acquired laboratory company. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to Our Business—We may not exercise full control over the operations of our French subsidiaries in which_
_we have a minority voting interest, including the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and are dependent on the biologists who_
_own a majority voting interest in them to conduct the operations of such subsidiaries.”_

Regulatory restrictions on the ownership of our subsidiaries in Belgium are much less stringent than those imposed by
French law. We operate our business in Belgium through subsidiaries fully owned directly and indirectly through CAB.

We believe that we are in compliance with all regulatory structuring requirements. However, regulations are subject to
change and we could incur significant expense if a regulatory authority were to take issue with our structure. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry –_ _We operate in a highly regulated sector. Compliance with regulations applicable_
_to our activities may increase our costs or restrict our activities. Failure to comply with such regulations may lead to_
_penalties of various types. Future alterations to regulations applicable to us may have a material adverse impact on our_

**Our Business**

**_Overview_**

We provide medical laboratory testing services in France and Belgium. Our business mainly consists of routine medical
laboratory testing operations that are performed in-house for patients in France and doctors or patients in Belgium and a
small portion of specialized tests that are either conducted in-house or outsourced. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic, we have also started providing COVID-19-related PCR and serology testing services in France and Belgium.
See “—Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic” for more information on the operation and financial impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on our business.

We are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in France and Belgium. For the twelve months
ended September 30, 2020, we generated pro forma net sales of €1,315.2 million, including net sales of €1,138.6 million
in France (including CBM25) and €176.7 million of pro forma net sales in Belgium through Medina Group, which we
acquired in October 2020.

We perform tests in-house that are either prescribed by doctors and medical institutions in connection with general patient
care to establish or support a diagnosis, to monitor treatment, to search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition or to prevent
a disease, or requested by the patients who elect to get tested for certain non-prescribed medical tests. The types of tests
we perform to date include:

� _Clinical biochemistry and chemistry testing, for analysis of bodily fluid samples;_

� _Hematology testing, including blood cell counts and analysis, for monitoring during surgery or blood disorders;_

� _Immunochemistry testing, including analysis of proteins to diagnose immune system such cancer, fertility_
problems, thyroid, anemia and cardiac testing;

� _Allergy testing, for allergic reactions against various substances;_

� _Molecular diagnostics and molecular biology testing, which involve gene-based tests for purposes of the early_
detection and monitoring of, and therapy selection for, infectious diseases;


-----

� _Microbiology testing, including for identification of infection-causing bacteria and detection of emerging_
antimicrobial resistance;

� _Cytology and pathology testing, for detection, analysis and typing of cancer;_

� _Infertility diagnosis, for testing of fertility of patients;_

� _Artificial intrauterine insemination, for infertility treatment (including both in vitro fertilization and assisted_
reproduction);

� _Non-invasive prenatal testing, for determination of genetic abnormalities of the fetus;_

� _Screening for fetal trisomy, for genetic screening of fetuses;_

� _Immunohematology, including pretransfusion and prenatal tests;_

� _Tumor marker testing, for identification of substances in the blood, urine, or tissues as cancer screening;_

� _Hormonology, for testing of hormone levels;_

� _Specialized hemostasis, for screening of coagulation defects; and_

� _Genetics testing, including for identification of mutated genes._

We also plan to invest in new tests by the end of 2021, including in tests relating to detecting Down’s syndrome during the
first quarter of pregnancy and detection of helicobacter pylori.

In France, we operate in several regional areas through a combination of multiple collection sites serviced by one or more
technical platforms where tests are actually performed. We believe this hub-and-spoke model provides an efficient use of
our resources. By collecting samples within close proximity to patients’ homes and workplaces, while centralizing testing
equipment and professionals at technical platforms, we are able to reduce equipment and personnel overhead costs
associated with carrying out testing at each collection site. Samples are collected by an internal logistics service (except
for our operations in Ile-de-France, which uses an external logistics services provider) several times a day for analysis, and
transported to one of the technical platforms to be analyzed. See “—Our Logistics”. In Belgium, we operate eight central
testing facilities and collect samples from general practitioners’ offices or, less frequently, from collection centers. By
collecting samples directly from practitioners, who typically also collect samples themselves, rather than from other
facilities, we are able to limit recurring costs in connection with sample collection and maximize efficiency. While we
perform most of our tests exclusively in-house through our technical platforms equipped with advanced testing technology,
we outsource a small portion of specialized tests with low demand (and where it is less profitable to invest in resources to
conduct the tests in-house), mostly in France where we outsource to our outsourcing partner, Biomnis, pursuant to a longterm outsourcing framework agreement. We re-evaluate our outsourcing policy from time to time in light of demand for
the tests we outsource. If we conclude that a test that we outsource becomes sufficiently recurrent, or there is an increase
in demand for such a test, we may decide to make an investment and purchase or lease the necessary equipment and hire
the appropriate staff to be able to perform the test in-house. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 2% of our tests in
France (in terms of volume) are outsourced. In Belgium, we similarly outsource only a small percentage of our tests,
typically to university laboratories. We try to minimize the quantity of outsourced tests because, under Belgian law, we are
responsible for 100% of the B-Value attributed to the test while we are only able to recover 25% of the B-Value. For a
limited time period during the initial lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had to outsource a small portion
of our COVID-19 testing in Belgium to certain hospitals, due to the limited availability of testing equipment and reagents.
For COVID-19 tests, the above-mentioned law on partial reimbursement was disapplied.

When we acquire a company that offers outsourced tests that we believe are not sufficiently profitable, the relevant
outsourcing contracts are either terminated immediately or soon after closing and replaced with an extension of our master


-----

agreement with our outsourcing partners, or renegotiated to align the prices and conditions offered by the acquired
company’s outsourcing partner with our standard outsourcing arrangements (usually immediately after closing).

We also provide medical lab tests requested by local clinics for a limited range of tests and provide emergency testing
assistance via our local technical platforms. In Belgium, we serve as an outsourcing party for certain other laboratories and
hospitals.

Our business is highly regulated in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including in terms of pricing for our
services. See “Industry” and “Regulation”.

**_Testing_**

We have made considerable investments in our testing capacity in order to have additional capacity to integrate new
laboratories into our existing testing infrastructure. As a result, we sustain a high utilization rate of our technical platforms
while maintaining sufficient back-up capacity as part of our contingency planning, in case we experience any technical
problems or disruptions in our operations.

Testing is generally organized into three phases: (i) the pre-analytical phase, which includes collecting samples and
transporting them to technical platforms, (ii) the analytical phase, during which the actual test is performed, and (iii) the
post-analytical phase, where results are delivered to the patient and/or prescribing doctor physically or digitally.

� _Pre-analytical phase. Before medical testing is performed, samples are collected from the patient, identified and_
delivered to our technical platforms for analysis. In France, patient samples are collected directly by the collection
sites, although in more remote areas, samples are collected by nurses who then submit samples to the technical
platforms. In Belgium, samples are primarily collected at doctors’ offices and transported to our technical
platforms for testing.

� _Analytical phase. Once we have logged in the test request and collected the samples, we perform the necessary_
tests. Most of the tests we perform are automated, while others must be performed manually by our medical
biologists or technicians. We perform most of our tests internally through a technical platform that centralizes
tests for several collection sites. During the analytical phase, we outsource a small portion of our specialized tests
(approximately 2% of our total tests by volume) that are less recurrent to external specialty testing provider.

� _Post-analytical phase. Our medical biologists analyze the test results once they become available._ A majority of
our testing is completed within 12 hours. Results are transmitted either in hard copy or made available
electronically to patients and/or doctors over the internet.

**_Our Operations_**

_France_

We are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in France, based on our pro forma net sales
in 2019. As of June 2020, we owned the largest network of laboratories in France, with 718 collection sites across seven
regions. We also have the most comprehensive regional footprint, with the highest number of collection sites in each region
in which we operate compared to other French laboratory companies. According to the industry report, which categorized
our operating regions into a total of 11 regions in France, we have an average of 65 collection sites per region, as compared
to a competitor average of 30.

Our Group is structured in dense networks of collection points located in close proximity to state-of-the-art and wellinvested technical platform hubs. Our average number of 17 sites per technical platform is above the market average,
allowing us to optimize utilization of technical platforms and achieve cost savings.

Medical doctors in France are prohibited by law from conducting laboratory tests themselves. As a result, patients who are
prescribed with medical tests or elect to get tested for non-prescribed tests are required to find a walk-in laboratory or


-----

arrange for a nurse or technician to collect a sample from their home. Patients who travel to a laboratory to have their
samples taken for testing typically choose a laboratory close to their place of residence, workplace or transport hub due to
convenience. We have accordingly made, and will continue to make, selective acquisitions of collection sites in the
respective regions targeted to maximize the number of visitations and testing. Each of our collection sites in France has
on-site medical biologists as required by law. Samples collected are then sent to one of our nearest regional technical
platforms for testing (or in the case of a small portion of specialized tests with low demand, are sent to our outsourcing
partner).

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, we conducted tests for approximately18.9 million files (created based
on visitation of patients) in France or approximately 74,500 files per working day.

Our business in France generated €1,138.6 million of pro forma net sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020,
representing 86.6% of our total pro forma net sales for the same period.

_Belgium_

In October 2020, we acquired the Medina Group (a total of eight laboratories) to expand our operations to the Belgian
laboratory testing market. We are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in Belgium, based
on our pro forma net sales in 2018. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we own 24 collection sites in the Flanders
region served by eight technical platforms, performing analyses for public hospitals, doctors and patients. As of September
30, 2020, our Belgian business operates almost exclusively in the Flanders region, while also serving a few general
practitioners in the Brussels and Walloon regions.

We believe that there are several small- to mid-sized independent laboratory groups in Belgium that could represent growth
opportunities for us, both in Flanders and in other regions in Belgium from time to time.

Our laboratories in Belgium offer a broad range of medical lab tests. The samples are collected at the collection sites that
we operate or at doctors’ offices, and sent to our regional technical platforms for testing.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, we conducted medical lab tests for approximately 3.3 million files
(created based on visitation of patients) in Belgium, or approximately 13,000 per working day.

Our business in Belgium generated collectively €176.7 million of net sales for the twelve months ended September 30,
2020, representing 13.4% of our pro forma total net sales for our business for the same period.

**Our Growth through Acquisitions**

We have grown our business mainly through strategic and bolt-on acquisitions and we expect our acquisition strategy to
continue to be an important driver of our future growth. We are a leading consolidator in the French medical laboratory
services market with a significant number of acquisitions completed to date and a demonstrated ability to extract. Since
January 1, 2015, we have completed more than 45 acquisitions of laboratory groups. As of June 2020, we owned the largest
network of laboratories in France and one of the largest networks of laboratories in Belgium. See _“—Our History” for_
more information on our previous acquisitions.

Our goal is to build a dense network of collection sites around each technical platform in order to optimize the utilization
of our technical platforms and therefore maximize synergies and cost savings. Our acquisition strategy is two-fold: when
we enter a new market, we establish a leading position in a targeted region by making a strategic acquisition of technical
platforms together with multiple collection sites, followed by smaller bolt-on acquisitions. Acquisitions in the regions in
which we are already present are primarily small- and mid-sized bolt-on acquisitions that can quickly and effectively be
integrated into our existing network infrastructure to realize significant operating synergies and cost savings at these sites.
We will closely appraise potential targets based on their location relative to our existing facilities, as well as other factors,
including customer accessibility. We will prioritize sites that we believe will help drive testing volume growth for our
technical platforms and further increase our market share. We will also leverage our local medical biologists’ knowledge
of the market and their relationships with the management of potential targets.


-----

We have an agile investment decision-making process which enables us to achieve a high rate of converting selected targets
into completed acquisitions. Our investment decisions are made primarily by a small team of senior management led by
our chief executive officer Stéphane Eimer, which is supported by a dedicated team of financial and legal advisors that
have extensive experience assisting us with our acquisition projects. We screen a limited number of potential targets and
focus on regions where we are already present to leverage our market knowledge gained from our medical biologists
working in the relevant region and their relationship with management of the potential target. We also from time to time
target significant businesses in order to expand into a region where we are not present, provided that the target has a leading
position and can serve as a consolidation platform. Key criteria for our acquisition decision are (i) we must own at least a
certain percentage of financial rights in the target post-closing, (ii) significant growth potential in the region, (iii) potential
to align EBITDA margin of the target with our existing EBITDA margin and (iv) expected synergies and cost savings with
our existing technical platform and network of collection sites.

Once we identify a target, we enter into a preliminary analysis phase, during which we review supply contracts, conduct a
financial analysis in order to determine synergy opportunities and conduct a legal analysis. The results of this preliminary
analysis are then submitted for approval by senior management as well as other managers who oversee key business areas
including IT, quality, supply chain, staff planning and human resources. Following approval, we then proceed to the nonbinding offer phase. While in exclusivity with the relevant sellers, we appoint audit and legal professionals to conduct
robust due diligence on the target and negotiate contractual savings with the target’s biologists and/or with external
suppliers to achieve synergies.

We have a successful track record of achieving cost savings and synergies from acquisitions due to our systematic approach
of (i) negotiating contractual savings, such as a decrease in the salaries of the target’s biologists who are otherwise
incentivized by becoming shareholders after the acquisition, (ii) replacing supplier contracts at the target with our master
agreements (or, where possible, renegotiating contracts to align prices with ours) so as to achieve economies of scale
through lower prices and (iii) centralizing testing in one regional technical platform, enabling us to streamline the overall
number of employees or replace a biologist with a lower-cost technician. For example, our acquisitions of Bioesterel in
December 2018 and Biolittoral in June 2019 both resulted in EBITDA margin increases which exceeded our initial target
margin. For the Bioesterel acquisition, we were able to improve Bioesterel’s pre-acquisition EBITDA margin of
approximately 23.4% as of December 2018 for the year ended December 31, 2018 to a post-acquisition EBITDA margin
of 33.4% as of December 2019 for the year ended December 31, 2019, exceeding our initial target EBITDA margin of
31.5% within 13 months. Similarly for the Biolittoral acquisition, we were able to improve Biolittoral’s pre-acquisition
EBITDA margin of approximately 14.1% as of June 2019 to a post-acquisition EBITDA margin of 36.5% as of December
2019 for the six months ended December 31, 2019, exceeding our initial target EBITDA of 35.1% within six months. We
work closely with the target to implement the cost savings and synergies at or shortly after the acquisition closing, as most
of the synergies are composed of contractual savings that are secured at the time of the signing of the acquisition agreement.

**Quality Standards**

We operate in a highly regulated market with stringent regulations and strict accreditation procedures governing the
granting or the renewal of a license to operate a laboratory and the standards by which any such laboratory is operated. Our
quality assurance efforts mainly focus on reporting accuracy, proficiency testing, process audits and training for all of our
medical biologists and technical staff for all laboratories and collection sites.

The laboratory services industry is subject to national level regulation that sets quality standards for operations. These
standards vary from country to country. See “Regulation”. Biogroup is committed to compliance with all applicable
accreditation and certification standards from governmental regulators such as _Comite français d’accreditation_
(“COFRAC”) in France and _de Belgische Accreditatie-instelling/l’Organisme belge d’Accreditation (“BELAC”) in_
Belgium. Both COFRAC and BELAC are members of several international accreditation recognition organizations,
including the ILAC (International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation), the IAF (“International Accreditation
**Forum”) and the EA (European co-operation for Accreditation). Accreditation by one member of any of these accreditation**
organizations will be recognized by other members. For more detail on the regulatory standards to which our operations
are subject, see “Regulation.”


-----

We track accreditation rate, which measures the number of tests (in volume and as a percentage of the total) carried out at
accredited sites and technical platforms and realized according to strictly defined standards (excluding subcontracting). As
of August 2020, the average accreditation rate was approximately 93%. We plan to apply for 100% accreditation under the
more rigorous ISO 15189 standard by April 30, 2021 and aim to obtain accreditation under the ISO 9001 standard by 2023.

To ensure robust quality control throughout the Group, our Quality Committee oversees and monitors all laboratories of
the Group. Dr. Michael Buser, our Quality Director, is a member of COFRAC in France and supervises our laboratories to
ensure they are up–to-date on regulatory requirements. Our facilities are subject to periodic external reviews for quality
assurance. Our facilities in France are subject to inspection by COFRAC every 18 months. Our facilities in Belgium are
also subject to review and inspection for adherence to BELAC norms on a periodic basis. Our Quality Committee includes
a representative from each of our laboratory companies and reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer.

**Our Customers**

Our main customers in France are patients who require medical tests in connection with the diagnosis, prevention,
monitoring and treatment of different diseases, and in Belgium, doctors who assign such tests to patients. Generally,
doctors, including both general practitioners and specialist physicians, prescribe the relevant tests to their patients.
However, there is also an increasing demand for non-prescribed and voluntary tests from our patients.

In France, patients choose their laboratory services provider, and proximity is a key deciding factor in that selection, in
addition to customer experience and quick turnaround of test results. In Belgium, general practitioners and specialist
physicians select their laboratory services provider. They will usually coordinate with one designated lab which acts as a
one-stop shop for all of the analyses they need for their patients. As a result the quality of the service, quick turnaround
and the scope of testing the lab provides are important in customer retention in Belgium. As we are paid directly by the
government and the patient and are prohibited from incentivizing the prescribing physicians, they do not have financial
incentive to favor one lab over another.

We believe our laboratories are perceived as convenient and capable of delivering quality test results with a quick
turnaround time, and consequently benefit from strong competitive advantages, especially against any potential new
entrants in the market. The convenience of our laboratories is underpinned by our dense network and the proximity of
available testing locations. We also maintain a close relationship with a network of general practitioners and specialist
physicians in Belgium. In particular, we believe our up-to-date IT systems and user-friendly platforms make our services
easy to access for general practitioners and specialist physicians in Belgium, giving us a competitive advantage. We also
publish newsletters and informational flyers from time to time made available at clinics and engage in prevention
campaigns/provide prevention workshops to the nurses and physicians, such as organizing HIV/AIDS preventative testing
campaigns or national awareness days for the prevention of HPV, to increase the visibility of our services. We have also
started providing testing to companies to facilitate employees returning to work. See “—Impact of the COVID-19
_Pandemic—Other COVID-19 Related Initiatives.”_

**Our Suppliers**

We have established a purchasing committee (which includes a purchasing officer from each laboratory company and is
chaired by our President and Chief Executive Officer) to coordinate and harmonize procurement practices across our
laboratory companies. Except for limited cases, we engage one or two suppliers per service and type of purchase under
respective long-term framework agreements, who then provide the relevant service and/or products nationally to our
collection sites and technical platforms. We believe that this selection process allows us to choose the best supplier for
each type of analysis and provides us with greater bargaining power to negotiate optimized purchasing conditions and
achieve attractive pricing on high quality products through economies of scale. For example, our framework agreements
with our suppliers provide for volume discounts which result in further costs saving with each acquisition that is integrated
into our central framework agreements. All of our laboratory companies utilize a single online platform, KaliLab, for the
procurement of supplies.

Once we have completed an acquisition, reagent supply contracts are either (i) terminated in case the target’s supplier is
not the same as ours and replaced with our master agreement, or (ii) renegotiated, where possible, to align prices with our


-----

more beneficial conditions. We aim to align the reagent costs and sub-contracting costs per group-wide contract conditions
so that the aligned costs can be implemented at the target immediately after the closing of the acquisition. Our consistent
growth in the market through acquisitions has allowed us to increase our ordered volumes and continuously re-negotiate
competitive prices under our master arrangements with our suppliers. We regularly re-negotiate our supplier framework
agreements following an increase in our market share and volumes to ensure they continue bringing the best value for our
Group as we continue to grow in scale.

The primary equipment and material required to conduct our business are testing equipment and reagents, which are both
provided by our reagent suppliers. Our main suppliers are reagent producers (including Roche and Siemens) as well as
specialized laboratories (such as Biomnis). We “lease” the majority of the equipment necessary to conduct our in-house
testing operations, as our reagent suppliers also supply the testing equipment at no upfront cost (except for the PCR testing
equipment which we purchased in March 2020 in connection with the increased demand for COVID-19-related tests) under
a single invoice. In other words, the cost of equipment is included in the cost we pay to the reagents. We regularly evaluate
the equipment (analytical systems and robotic, pre and post-analytical devices) used by our collection sites and technical
platforms. As we continue to grow in scale, prices are set from time to time through agreements with volume discounts
which we enter into with our suppliers.

**Our Logistics**

Our internal logistics service includes approximately 534 full-time employee drivers in France, which covers all regions in
which we operate except for Ile-de-France (where we use logistics service providers for delivery of test samples) and
approximately 161 full-time employee drivers in Belgium.

Our drivers are responsible for ensuring the timely delivery of test samples from collection sites to our network of technical
platforms. In Belgium, our drivers are responsible for picking-up samples at general practitioners’ or specialists’ offices
once or twice a day and delivering them to our network of technical platforms and thus maintain frequent direct contact
with general practitioners’ or specialists’ back office staff. We believe this helps us maintain the quality and reliability of
our service. We primarily lease the vehicles that comprise our logistics fleet. As part of our collective ESG policy, we have
started to replace our logistics fleets with electric vehicles in 2020.

Our drivers are trained in the proper handling of samples during collection and transportation, including in the use of
appropriate transport containers, the labelling of containers, the manner in which samples and containers are stored in the
vehicle, the temperature at which samples must be transported and the duration of the journey. Our drivers are trained to
handle biological samples in accordance with best practices and applicable laws and regulations, as mishandling samples
in the collection and transportation process can increase the likelihood of errors in laboratory testing. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to Our Business—Disruption, failure or unsuitable delivery of sample transportation services could_
_adversely affect our business and financial results._

Furthermore, our logistics operations allow us to more easily integrate new acquisitions of laboratories into our existing
operations and network of collection sites, without having to re-negotiate the terms with the external logistics provider.
Our logistics team is also supported by external logistics providers in Ile-de-France where we do not operate our own
logistics activities and in France for the delivery of test samples to specialized laboratories and back to our technical
platform for testing that are outsourced to specialized labs.

**Billing and Payment**

In France, medical laboratory testing expenses are largely covered by public funding with CNAM (70.7%) or private
insurance (23.8%), with patient out-of-pocket expenses representing a small proportion of expenses (5.5%). In Belgium,
medical laboratory testing expenses are largely covered by the national social welfare agency (between 70% and 100%),
with out-of-pocket patient expenses amounting up to 30% of the total price of the medical test, on average.

Billing for our businesses is a complex process involving several payers. Depending on the billing arrangement and the
applicable law of the country in which we operate, the payer may be a third party responsible for providing health insurance


-----

coverage to patients (such as national public health insurance or a private medical insurance plan), a patient or other party
(such as a hospital, another laboratory or an employer) who has outsourced testing to us, or a combination of these parties.

We generally bill for medical testing services on a fee for service basis. In France, the rates we can legally charge for the
laboratory tests we perform are set by the Ministry of Health (Ministère des Affaires sociales et de la Santé) and CNAM.
Based on the size of the private lab market in the industry report and the proportion of spending in the French private
medical testing market according to “Les dépenses de santé 2019” published by DREES in 2020, approximately 70.7% of
spending in the French medical laboratory testing market in 2019 was financed by the French Health Insurance and the
remainder was covered by private insurance companies (approximately 23.8%) and by the patient directly out-of-pocket
(approximately 5.5%).

In Belgium, the social security system reimburses approximately between 70% and 100% of the price of the tests performed
by medical biology laboratories, with patients responsible for the remainder. Belgian regulations also permit laboratories
to charge patients a nominal administrative fee on a per patient basis.

In France and Belgium, the patients pay the portion of the fee for which they are responsible (if any) at the time of service
and the remainder is paid to us by a third-party payer (such as CPAM, private health organizations and complementary
private health insurance) generally within 30 days. In France, when the test is covered by the list of tests that are eligible
for reimbursement, the French Health Insurance will cover from 70% up to 100% of the set fee. Fees are covered at 100%
for pregnant women and patients with long-term illnesses. Otherwise the remainder that is not reimbursed by the French
Health Insurance must be paid by the patient out of pocket or by the patient’s private complementary insurance. However,
if the test is not on the list of medical tests that are eligible for reimbursement, the patient must pay the lab administering
the test directly. In Belgium, if a certain test is eligible for government reimbursement, the Belgian Health Insurance will
cover from 70% up to 100% of the price for a test directly to us, with the remainder being paid directly by the patient. We
have the option to also charge an optional supplement fee paid by the patient (typically up to 10%), which is customary for
lab testing operations in Belgium. These supplement fees are never applied to certain categories of patients, for example
widows, orphans, retired patients, disabled patients and patients for whom there would otherwise not be an invoice.

We transfer a patient file for reimbursement to health insurance companies in France and Belgium typically within five
days after the testing results become available, and are reimbursed within 15 days after the submission of the files. We
have experienced a temporary delay in submitting patient files due to the COVID-19 pandemic and re-allocation of
administrative personnel to support COVID-19-related testing demand at our collection sites between July and November
2020, which temporarily adversely affected our working capital. Reimbursement cycles have since returned to normal. For
more information on our working capital, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
_of Operations”._

Although we believe we have no material issues related to collecting fees for our services, we are subject to the risk of
non-payment by patients and other clients. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Financial difficulties of
_certain of our clients or third party payers may require us to write off debts.” We maintain reserves for doubtful accounts_
and amounts past due.

**Health and Safety and Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG)**

Our business is subject to licensing and other requirements under EU, national and local laws and regulations relating to
the protection of the environment and human and occupational health and safety, including those requirements governing
the handling, transportation and disposal of medical samples and biological, infectious and hazardous waste. All our
facilities are subject to requirements for the disposal of medical samples at authorized facilities and we generally utilize
outside vendors for the disposal of such samples. Nevertheless, we could be held responsible for cleanup of contamination
at such sites attributable to our wastes.

As part of the ISO 15189 standard accreditation, we have identified our main health and safety risks, which are linked to
exposures to blood, chemicals and road accidents for courier deliveries. Each of our laboratories maintains its own risk
directory as required by law, and we track frequency and severity of occupational accidents for monitoring purposes. We
pay a separate bonus to our selected employees on a quarterly basis based on their diligence to discourage absenteeism.


-----

In addition, our business is subject to extensive requirements relating to workplace safety in medical laboratories,
particularly for employees who could be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. These
regulations, among other things, require strict work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical
follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and the transmission of, blood-borne
pathogens.

As a result of the outbreak of COVID-19, we have implemented a series of additional safety measures and procedures to
ensure the health and safety of all of our employees in accordance with French and Belgian regulations. These measures
have included implementing shift systems, including weekends, promoting flexible working arrangements, regular
COVID-19 testing of our employees, social distancing (especially in the respective head offices) and wearing masks.

As part of our collective ESG policy, we have set a target to achieve “zero-paper” and have adopted measures to reduce
paper waste from our operations, including encouraging our patients to retrieve their results online. We have also hired an
external service provider to collect and recycle paper and cardboard wastes.

Moreover, we monitor our risks in connection with applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations, including but not
limited to, the French law of December 9, 2016 relating to transparency, fighting corruption and modernizing economic
life (“Sapin II”), and plan to adopt additional measures to enhance compliance across our laboratory network. As part of
ISO 15189 standard accreditation and COFRAC and BELAC certification process, we have established internal protocols
in selection and annual assessment of our suppliers. We have updated our code of conduct in January 2021, and are in the
process of developing and deploying a rigorous anti-corruption compliance employee training program.

According to the sustainability report, our performance on health and safety is comparable to our industry peers. Although
we are not aware of any current material non-compliance with our obligations under environmental, health and safety laws
and regulations in connection with our operations, failure to comply with such laws and regulations in the future could
subject us to civil and criminal fines and penalties, remediation costs, enforcement actions, the suspension or termination
of our licenses to operate or third party claims. See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Industry – _We operate in a highly_
_regulated sector. Compliance with regulations applicable to our activities may increase our costs or restrict our activities._
_Failure to comply with such regulations may lead to penalties of various types. Future alterations to regulations applicable_
_to us may have a material adverse impact on our activities.”_

**Information Technology Systems**

We use information technology systems (or “IT systems”) in virtually all aspects of our business, including medical
laboratory testing, billing, customer service and the management of medical data. The successful delivery of our services
depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems, especially when time is of the essence
for a laboratory test result.

We utilize an automated tracking system and sample picking at the time of delivery, and we manage the collected laboratory
data and test results by utilizing a centralized, in-house developed laboratory information management system, which
connects various operating laboratories, patient and physicians portals, and our other departments such as communication,
account and human resources. As a result, our operational entities have centralized and harmonized access to the relevant
laboratory data and other information about the tests that are offered by our network, including the cost of the relevant
medical tests, and facilitates the prompt return of testing results. Patients and physicians portals also allow us to attract new
customers and receive and track customer feedback efficiently.

We operate two main IT systems teams to oversee our IT systems-related operations: our applications development team,
which engages in application development and maintenance of our core IT systems, and our operations team, which is in
charge of infrastructure management and maintenance, such as networks equipment, servers, telephony, IT security and
monitoring.

Our IT systems are hosted in two main data centers, with the first data center operating as the main server for core business
and support functions as well as the first back-up server, and the second data center hosting a mirrored system and a second
back-up server. Our collection sites and technical platforms are connected to data centers through a multiprotocol label


-----

switching network, which are provided by Telenet (as a network telecom provider) and Symac (for network equipment and
related maintenance). The underlying network is protected via firewalls for public network access, which we expect to
further update in 2021.

We understand that security is essential to our operations, and we aim to maintain appropriate technical and organizational
security measures across the network in order to ensure the security of our patients’ data and to prevent cybersecurity
incidents. In particular, we maintain internal procedures for data management in compliance with the latest regulations,
protection of sensitive and medical data (in terms of classification, data breach identification and resolution, identity
verification prior to accessing medical data) and protection of personal data, including in connection with GDPR. In order
to comply with the requirements under GDPR, we have implemented several measures, such as the following: (i) appointed
a data protection officer; (ii) established records of processing activities; (iii) implemented information notices to data
subjects and procedures to handle data subjects’ access requests; and (iv) reviewed and amended data processing
agreements entered into with third party providers where such providers were involved in the processing of personal data.
We are in the process of adopting additional measures to implement the remaining modules of our GDPR compliance
program. As of the date of this offering memorandum we have no ongoing disputes, complaints or proceedings in relation
to the processing of personal data.

We conduct periodic monitoring and network partitioning, and have implemented various prevention measures (such as
logs tracking and automated vulnerabilities detection). In collaboration with our human resources department, we conduct
periodic reviews of VPNs and access logs to monitor user access to sensitive information on our server. We also limit
access to server rooms to authorized personnel only, which are secured by door codes and security cameras. If a breach is
identified, our internal procedures allow our operations to react quickly and implement appropriate resolutions. Supported
by our detailed business continuity plan and data recovery plan, we continue assessing our infrastructure equipment and
network system to ensure sufficient backup, duplicated systems and redundant equipment are in place, including in case of
a disaster or any other unforeseen interruptions.

We also perform penetration tests and security audits on a regular basis to simulate cyberattacks and identify any potential
vulnerabilities in our IT systems. As of the date of this offering memorandum, no major security breaches or vulnerabilities
have been identified based on our latest penetration test.

We have implemented, and will continue to implement, various cybersecurity improvement programs across our laboratory
network. For example, we organize cybersecurity awareness programs and training campaigns on the relevant ISO
standards every one to two years, with the latest held in 2020. We have also appointed a Chief Information Security Officer
(“CISO”) in August 2020 to supervise our cybersecurity roadmap and improvement plan.

Historically, we have grown through acquisitions and as part of our integrated business model, and to maintain the quality
of our IT system and relevant staff members, we ensure that our IT supply contracts are implemented at the target and that
our IT systems are integrated in a short timeframe following closing.

**Facilities**

Our facilities consist primarily of collection sites, technical platforms and office space for the employees. As of the date of
this offering memorandum, we had approximately 718 collection sites and 43 principal technical platforms in France and
24 collection sites and eight technical platforms in Belgium. We rent the majority of our premises pursuant to commercial
leases, which are long-term leases subject to tacit renewal (tacite prolongation). In addition, for certain COVID-19-related
testing, we have expanded our operations to temporary dedicated testing premises which are provided by the relevant
owners for free (such as at schools that are located near our collection sites). We believe that our facilities are generally
adequate for our present needs and that suitable additional or replacement space would be available to the extent required.
Our headquarter office is located in Saint Denis, France.

**Employees**

As of September 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis, we had approximately 8,459 full-time equivalent employees, including
approximately 936 medical biologists, including 910 in France and 26 in Belgium. Our operation was also supported by


-----

794 non-salaried medical biologists. We hire mostly full-time employees but because of COVID-19; we have hired parttime employees to help with our increased workload and provide necessary working flexibility during the crisis.

In both France and Belgium, we are subject to collective bargaining agreements negotiated between unions and employers’
representatives at the national level and made mandatory pursuant to national labor law. Following an acquisition, medical
biologists employed by the target company tend to continue working within the Group to avoid triggering the non-compete
clauses in their employment contracts. The turnover of employees within the Group varies depending on the region, and
we believe it is comparable to turnover in other industries and to that of our competitors. Our employees in France benefit
from profit sharing agreements (which mandatory under French law), which incentivize their involvement and retention in
the Group.

While we have not experienced any material labor disputes within the last three years, we may experience labor disputes
that could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs. See “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to our Business – Labor
_disputes could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs.”_

For the year ended December 31, 2019, our payroll and related expenses amounted to €231.5 million.

**Intellectual Property**

Generally, we do not regard intellectual property to be a material part of our assets or essential to our operations. Besides
intellectual property protections on our business and trade names, we do not hold any material intellectual property assets.

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance, both on the Group as a whole, and at each individual laboratory we own, against various risks
related to our business and operations, including mandatory professional civil liability (for which amendments are made
from time to time for laboratories conducting specific activities within the scope of our business, such as tests related to
fertility treatments or prenatal diagnosis), fire insurance combined property damage and, in respect of certain of our
laboratories, business interruption policies. We have taken out directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for executives
within our Group. We also maintain applicable compulsory workers’ compensation and motor liability coverage. We also
maintain general excess liability policies that provide coverage in situation where the limit under the applicable primary
policy is insufficient to satisfy the claim.

We believe that our existing insurance policies are adequate in terms of both amounts covered and conditions of coverage
to cover the major risks of our business, taking into account the cost of insurance coverage and the potential risks to
business operations. However, there can be no assurance that no losses will be incurred or that this coverage will be
sufficient to cover the cost of defense or damages in the event of a significant claim. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_Our Business—We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance.”_

**Legal Proceedings**

We have been involved, and may be involved in the future, in various legal or governmental proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business, including disputes concerning our acquisitions, professional liability and employee-related
matters, regulatory matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and health insurance carriers regarding, among
other things, billing issues. Because we operate in a regulated industry, we are, in the ordinary course of business, subject
to national and local regulatory scrutiny, supervision and controls. For more information on the regulations governing our
business, see “Regulation.”

**_CBM25_**

On July 7, 2019, SPFPL Widmer (which was subsequently merged into CAB) acquired shares in CBM25 from 12 biologists
(or their personal holding vehicles) (the “CBM25 Sellers”) for consideration of €71.9 million (the “CBM25
**Consideration”). On December 19, 2019, at the request of LBI Développement, the Tribunal de Grande Instance of**
Besançon found that the acquisition had breached the pre-emption right of LBI Développement that arose from an


-----

affiliation agreement dated September 1, 2016 entered into between CBM25 and LBI Développement (the “Affiliation
**Agreement”) and annulled the acquisition. SPFPL Widmer and the CBM25 Sellers initially appealed this decision, but in**
May 2020, in compliance with this judgment, SPFPL Widmer reassigned the shares of CBM25 back to the CBM25 Sellers.
CAB and the CBM25 Sellers subsequently signed a second sale and purchase agreement dated May 14, 2020 (the “Second
**SPA”) and relaunched the pre-emption procedure vis-à-vis LBI Développement in accordance with the Affiliation**
Agreement.

On November 24, 2020, the Tribunal Judiciaire of Besançon ordered the suspension of the time limit for LBI
Développement to pre-empt pending the disclosure of certain information. None of the Biogroup companies are parties to
this second litigation. Further to this second litigation, CAB decided to let the Second SPA lapse on December 1, 2020,
and on December 4, 2020, the CBM25 Sellers notified LBI Développement that they no longer intend to sell the CBM25
shares (the “December 2020 Notice”). Instead, CAB offered under a put option agreement to, once the Affiliation
Agreement has lapsed (which is expected to occur on September 30, 2021), acquire the CBM25 shares from the CBM25
Sellers for an amount of €71.9 million. The CBM25 Sellers, as the beneficiary of this put option, have the option to sell
their shares in CBM25 to CAB between October 1, 2021 and March 31, 2022.

Laboratoire Eimer consolidated the operations of CBM25 in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on the basis of de facto control over CBM25 exercised
by Laboratoire Eimer, the then ongoing appeal and on the basis of the Second SPA. For the year ended December 31, 2019,
the CBM25 contribution to our 2019 consolidated pro forma EBITDA amounted to €5.3 million. However, as of
December 1, 2020, given the termination of the Second SPA and the December 2020 Notice, Biogroup no longer exercises
_de facto control over CBM25 and Laboratoire Eimer will therefore deconsolidate the operations of CBM25 from its_
consolidated financial statements. As a result, the CBM25 Consideration will be recorded as a claim against the CBM25
Sellers on our consolidated balance sheet going forward. Since July 7, 2019, there have been no financial transactions or
arrangements between CBM25 and Biogroup (such as cash pooling, distribution of dividends or the payment of
management fees) other than those in the ordinary course of trading and on arms' length terms.

**_Cerba Litigation_**

On December 14, 2020, Cerba Selafa, Cefid and Cerba Healthcare (the “Cerba Group”) initiated legal proceedings
against, among others, Laborizon, CAB and Laborizon Centre (the “Cerba Litigation”).

On March 29, 2017, three trade unions (Syndicat des Jeunes Biologistes Médicaux (“SJBM”), Syndicat des Biologistes
(“SdB”) and Syndicat des Laboratoires de Biologie Clinique (“SLBC”) and collectively, the “Trade Unions”) initiated
legal proceedings against, among others, the Cerba Group, based on unfair competition, alleging that the legal structure
and ownership of, among others, Cerba Group, albeit compliant with the letter of French law, would violate its spirit (the
“March 2017 Litigation”). Under the March 2017 Litigation, the Trade Unions are seeking a judgment against the Cerba
Group that would nullify or render inoperable certain provisions in the articles of incorporation and shareholder agreements
in certain of the Cerba Group’s subsidiaries that are subject to French legal restrictions on the legal structure and ownership
of medical laboratories.

Pursuant to the Cerba Litigation, the Cerba Group is seeking that the Tribunal de Grande Instance of Pontoise apply any
judgment rendered in favor of the Trade Unions under the March 2017 Litigation to, among others, Laborizon, CAB and
Laborizon Centre, as well.

Both the Cerba Litigation and the March 2017 Litigation are ongoing. Should a judgment be rendered in favor of the Trade
Unions under the March 2017 Litigation and in favor of Cerba Group under the Cerba Litigation, and appeals against such
judgments prove unsuccessful, we would be subject to the decision of the court under the March 2017 Litigation. While
the legal and practical consequences of such judgment on Biogroup, our subsidiaries and the medical laboratory industry
in which we operate are currently unclear, we may be required to amend the existing ownership and legal structure of our
French operations and to implement a new structure for any future acquisitions in France. See “Regulation—France” and
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not exercise full control over the operations of our French
_subsidiaries in which we have a minority voting interest, including the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and are dependent on_
_the biologists who own a majority voting interest in them to conduct the operations of such subsidiaries.”_


-----

**Regulation**

_We are subject to extensive government regulation in each of the countries in which we operate across our lines of business._
_Regulations that pertain to operating requirements, professional qualifications of laboratory personnel, constraints on the_
_ownership of medical laboratories (which are especially strict in France), and pricing and reimbursement levels of medical_
_laboratory tests affect our business._

_We are also affected by numerous other laws and regulations that impose restrictions and requirements on the handling_
_and storing of certain chemicals and reagents as well as the disposal of biological refuse, govern the handling and storing_
_of personal data and aim to prevent fraud to social security systems._

**France**

**_Pricing and Reimbursement_**

With respect to pricing and reimbursement for medical lab testing in France, medical laboratories are bound by the prices
set by the Ministry of Health and CNAM. Prices are revised annually through negotiations among the Ministry of Health,
the National Health Insurance Fund and medical biologists’ labor unions. For the recent changes in the government
regulated lab testing prices, see “Industry—Medical Laboratory Testing,” and “Industry—France”. Based on the size of
the private lab market in the industry report and the proportion of spending in the French private medical testing market
according to “Les dépenses de santé en 2019 —Résultats des comptes de la santé,” a report published in 2020 by Panorama
de La Drees Santé, approximately 70.7% (or €3.3 billion) of spending in the French private medical testing market was
financed by the French social security system and the remainder was covered by private insurance companies
(approximately 23.8%, or €1.1 billion) and by the patient directly out-of-pocket (approximately 5.5%, or €0.3 billion) in
2019.

The reimbursement of tests by the French National Health Insurance is subject to a regulatory procedure before the French
High Health Authority (“HAS”) and its specialised Medical Device and Health Technology Evaluation Committee
(“CNEDIMTS”) followed by an agreement with the National Health Insurance Fund, which must be entered into by
medical laboratories and each of the pathologists practicing within the laboratory. Any failure of one of the pathologists or
of the laboratory to comply with the terms of the aforementioned agreement may lead to the suspension of reimbursement
by the National Health Insurance Fund (déconventionnement).

**_Quality and Accreditation Standards for testing activities_**

French law used to require an administrative authorization (autorisation administrative) for the establishment and operation
of medical laboratories. As part of the authorization process, local health authorities reviewed a filing detailing the
laboratory’s corporate form and governance, premises, equipment, tests, and operating procedures, as well as the
professional qualifications of the laboratory’s personnel, including medical biologists. The law sets minimal standards to
be met in each of these areas. A laboratory had to inform local health authorities of changes affecting any of the above
matters.

Pursuant to an ordinance dated January 13, 2010 (ordonnance n° 2010-49 relative à la biologie médicale), which was
ratified by law n° 2013-442 dated May 30, 2013 related to the reform of medical biology, the existing administrative
authorization process has been gradually replaced after November 1, 2020 (with an intermediary step in 2016, concerning
50% of the tests performed by a laboratory) by an accreditation procedure to be carried out by COFRAC. The accreditation
procedure introduces new, stricter requirements for medical laboratories pursuant to standards promulgated by the ISO
(namely, the ISO 15189 standard). The ordinance provides for a transitional regime, whereby:

� until October 31, 2020, a non-accredited medical laboratory may not operate on the basis of its administrative
authorization without complying with the regulatory requirements described above relating to, notably, premises,
equipment and mandatory minimums on the number of medical biologists. However, the administrative
authorization could be withdrawn if by November 1, 2016, the laboratory had not been accredited for 50% of the
tests it performs; yet, medical laboratories were allowed to continue to operate until December 31, 2017 if they


-----

fulfilled two criteria: being accredited for (i) each of the three families of examinations practiced (biochemistrygenetics, immunology-hematology-reproductive biology, microbiology) and for (ii) at least 50% of their activity;

� since November 1, 2013, a non-accredited medical laboratory is required to demonstrate that it has effectively
begun the new accreditation process; and

� as from May 1, 2021, a medical laboratory may no longer perform medical biology examinations corresponding
to the scope lines (lignes de portée) for which it is not accredited without having submitted to COFRAC an
application for accreditation relating to these scope lines. A scope line corresponds to a set of medical biology
examinations with common characteristics requiring a common accreditation methodology;

The accreditation is issued for a maximum period of four years. During this first four-year period, COFRAC conducts its
first on-site surveillance audit at 12-months after the initial accreditation takes effect and then in such way that the
laboratory is evaluated on site every 15 months at most. The accreditation is renewable for periods of up to 5 years following
an on-site assessment. After the renewal of the accreditation, on-site surveillance audits of the laboratory by COFRAC take
place every 23 months at most.

COFRAC may suspend or revoke a laboratory’s accreditation for all or part of the laboratory’s business if such laboratory
fails to comply with the requisite health, safety and quality standards. Furthermore, French law provides for substantial
fines and penalties if the regulatory requirements for the grant of administrative authorizations and/or accreditation are
breached.

If a medical laboratory, incorporated as a company, is accredited for 100% of the tests it performs, there is no limit under
French law as to the number of branch offices (sites) that it may operate. If a medical laboratory, incorporated as a company,
is not accredited for 100% of the tests it performs, it cannot increase the total number of branch offices open to the public
and is restricted to relocating existing sites. However, regardless of its level of accreditation, a laboratory company may
not open sites in more than three contiguous regional zones as delimited by each regional health authority (zone déterminée
_en application du b du 2° de l’article L. 1434-9 du Code de la santé publique) and for each branch office, at least one_
medical biologist shall be appointed to enable a speedy medical support to each branch office (meaning that a laboratory
company must have at least as many medical biologists as branch offices). Furthermore, regional health authorities
(agences régionales de santé) may further deny opening of new medical laboratories (or new branch offices of existing
laboratories) within a given geographic area as delimited by each regional health authority (zone déterminée en application
_du b du 2° de l’article L. 1434-9 du Code de la santé publique) if the proposed laboratory’s testing operations would cause_
the offer of testing operations to exceed by 25% the relevant zone’s testing needs. Health authorities may also veto
acquisitions of laboratory companies or branch offices, or mergers of laboratory companies if the share of the tests
performed by the consolidated laboratory would exceed 25% of the total number of tests performed in the relevant zone.
Furthermore, the acquisition of shares of a laboratory company is prohibited if such acquisition would result in the acquirer
controlling, directly or indirectly, the performance of more than 33% of the tests performed in the relevant zone.

French law also limits the number of tests that can be outsourced by a medical laboratory to other laboratories every year
to 15% of the total number of tests it conducts. This limitation does not apply to the outsourcing of tests between branch
offices of a single medical laboratory company. The outsourcing of tests is monitored by the regional health authorities
and the absence of representation or misrepresentation concerning outsourced activities may give rise to administrative
sanctions.

**_Additional Requirements for laboratories involved in medically assisted procreation activities_**

Pursuant to the Public Health Code, biological activities of medically assisted procreation may be performed only in
accredited medical biology laboratories.

In addition, medically assisted procreation activities, both medical and biological, must be authorized by the DirectorGeneral of the regional health authority (Agence Régionale de santé or ARS) after obtaining the opinion of (i) the
specialized commission of the Regional Conference on Health and Autonomy responsible for the health sector (commission


-----

_spécialisée de la conférence régionale de la santé et de l'autonomie compétente pour le secteur sanitaire) and of the_
Biomedicine Agency (Agence de biomédecine).

The authorization covers one or more of the following biological activities:

� the preparation and preservation of semen for artificial insemination;

� activities relating to in vitro fertilization without or with micromanipulation, including in particular:

� the collection, preparation and storage of semen;

� oocyte preparation and in vitro fertilization with or without micromanipulation;

� the collection, preparation, storage and availability of sperm for donation;

� the preparation, storage and availability of oocytes for donation;

� the storage of gametes and germ tissue for autologous use in application of Article L. 2141-11 of the Public Health
Code;

� the storage of embryos for parental projects;

� the storage of embryos for the purpose of their reception.

The authorization is granted to a laboratory with reference to the affiliated medical pathologist who is qualified to practice
in the field of medically assisted procreation.

The authorization is issued for a period of seven years (five years for authorizations issued before January 5, 2018) and
may be renewed.

Medical laboratories must perform their medically assisted procreation activities on premises separate from the main
premises of the laboratory. In addition, biomedical laboratories authorized to perform medically assisted procreation
activities (i) must submit an annual activity report to the ARS and the Biomedicine Agency and (ii) are subject to
administrative control at least every two years.

Performing medically assisted reproduction activities without obtaining authorization or without complying with its
requirements is punishable by two years' imprisonment and a fine of €30,000.

Any violation found in an establishment or laboratory of the requirements laid down in the authorization to perform
medically assisted procreation activities leads to the suspension or withdrawal of the authorization.

**_Professional Licensing and Ethics_**

Medical biologists, technicians and laboratory personnel collecting patient samples must meet certain minimum
professional qualifications.

In France, each medical laboratory must be supervised during business hours by at least one medical biologist who acts as
the legal representative of the laboratory company and is responsible for its operations, including the processing of tests
outsourced to other laboratories. In each branch office, at least one medical biologist of the laboratory company must be
able to meet the needs of the branch office and, if necessary, to intervene in a time frame compatible with patient safety
requirements.

Medical biologists must be registered with the pharmacists’ professional association (Ordre des Pharmaciens) or the
medical doctors’ professional association (Ordre des Médecins, together, the “Ordres”), depending on whether they are
qualified as pharmacists or medical doctors. Through their membership in an Ordre, medical biologists working in medical


-----

laboratories are subject to the same rules of professional conduct as medical doctors and pharmacists set by the relevant
_Ordre. Laboratory companies must also be registered with one or both Ordres, based on the professional affiliation of the_
medical biologists practicing within such laboratories.

The Ordre des Pharmaciens and the Ordre des Médecins are self-regulatory bodies with administrative and disciplinary
powers over practicing professionals. They also represent, respectively, the collective interests of pharmacists and medical
doctors (including in both cases, medical biologists) before French public authorities and may be called upon to issue
opinions (avis) on certain matters involving their profession, including proposed laws and regulations. The Ordres also
monitor compliance by practicing professionals with applicable laws and regulations.

Among the professional conduct rules enforced by the Ordre des Pharmaciens is the principle of independence defined in
Article R.4235-18 of the French Public Health Code. Pursuant to this principle, a pharmacist may not be subject to any
financial, commercial, technical or moral constraint, if such constraint could impair his or her professional independence.
A similar provision affecting medical doctors, Article R.4127-5 of the French Public Health Code, provides that a medical
doctor cannot, in any manner or form, compromise his or her professional independence.

The _Ordre des Pharmaciens_ and the _Ordre des Médecins_ regulate access to the profession by maintaining respective
national registries of practicing professionals (each, a _Tableau de l’Ordre), on which every practicing pharmacist or_
medical doctor, as well as every medical laboratory company, must be registered. New medical laboratories, including
entities formed by the merger of pre-existing laboratories, must apply for registration on the relevant Tableau de l’Ordre
as a prerequisite to obtaining administrative authorization. An Ordre may withhold or suspend registration due to violation
of the relevant professional conduct rules.

Medical laboratories are subject to ongoing regulatory supervision by each of the Ordres and, as a consequence, must
submit to the relevant _Ordre for review any proposed change in their capital ownership or articles of association, any_
cooperation contracts entered into with other medical laboratories and, more generally, any agreements relating to their
operations or governing the relations between their shareholders. Upon its review, the Ordre may inform regional health
authorities of any perceived regulatory violations. The regional health authorities are not bound by the findings of the
relevant Ordre in this respect. As part of its disciplinary powers, each professional association may impose disciplinary
sanctions on medical biologists, including the temporary or permanent suspension of practicing professionals who have
breached professional conduct rules.

It is worth mentioning that, following a complaint lodged by Labco, it has been found by the General Court of the European
Union that the Ordre des Pharmaciens had restricted competition on the medical biology analysis market by adopting a
restrictive interpretation of French regulations in order to prevent groups of laboratories from developing in France
(Judgment of 10th December 2014, Case T-90/11, Ordre national des pharmaciens and Others v Commission).

Regional health authorities in France monitor compliance by medical laboratories with health and safety regulations
through on-site inspections. In addition, certain tests or categories of tests are controlled by specialized agencies as part of
a yearly quality control program. Regional health authorities may impose administrative sanctions on medical laboratories
and, in certain instances, medical biologists, for violations of certain regulatory requirements, including health, safety and
quality regulations. These sanctions range from fines to the temporary or permanent closing of the laboratory, in the case
of particularly serious or repeated violations. Certain illegal activities, including the illegal practice of medical biology
(exercice illégal des fonctions de biologiste médical) and the misleading use of the title of medical biologist by a person
without the legal right to do so (usage sans droit de la qualité de biologiste médical), carry criminal penalties that range
from the prohibition to practice medical biology or operate a medical laboratory to imprisonment for individuals.

In addition, medical laboratories may not advertise their services, directly or indirectly, to the general public. Certain
information provided to medical doctors is, however, excluded from this prohibition, notably information of a medical or
scientific nature, and upon opening of a new laboratory, the public announcement of the laboratory’s existence, location,
and test offerings.

Further, medical laboratories and their practicing medical doctors are subject to transparency requirements under the socalled “French Sunshine Act”. Law no. 2011-2012 of December 29, 2011 on the Strengthening of Health Protection for


-----

Medicinal and Health Products (loi relative au renforcement de la sécurité sanitaire du médicament et des produits de
_santé), also known as the “Loi Bertrand”, as amended, introduced specific transparency obligations for all companies_
manufacturing or commercializing health products or providing associated services.

Companies providing associated services include companies providing technical services (e.g., installation, maintenance,
user training) related to the use of health products, companies providing health products or services subject to the
reimbursement by the social security system, and companies involved in the communication and advertising thereof.

The aforementioned companies must disclose the existence of agreements (excluding agreements regarding the purchase
of goods or the provision of services) entered into with, remunerations and fringe benefits greater or equal to €10 (taxes
included) provided to, ten categories of health care actors listed in Article L. 1453-1 of the Public Health Code:

� Health care professionals (e.g. physicians, pharmacists, nurses, mid-wives, etc.);

� Associations of health care professionals;

� Students intending to become health care professionals and representative groups and associations of these
students;

� Patient associations;

� Health establishments refered to in the Part 6 of the French Public Health Code (including, notably, hospitals and
medical laboratories);

� Non-profit associations (e.g. foundations) and advisory boards in the healthcare sector;

� Publishing companies, radio and television publishers, and publishers of online (public) communication services
(in particular scientific and medical press);

� Media and social media influencers;

� Designers of software for prescription and delivery of health products; and

� Legal entities providing or participating in the initial and continuing training of healthcare professionals (e.g.
universities or university hospitals).

The Information that is required to be disclosed under the transparency requirements must be submitted to the Ministry of
Health. The information is then published on the public transparency website, www.transparence.sante.gouv.fr.

Companies that “knowingly” violate the transparency requirements may be subject to a criminal fine of up to €225,000.
Additional sanctions, such as a ban on participation in public tenders, suspension of business activities, and temporary or
permanent closing of facilities may also apply. Individuals may also face sanctions such as the public communication of
the sentence, being barred from exercising a public function or a commercial or industrial profession, and a prohibition to
commercialize, import and market health products.

Ultimately, in parallel to the transparency obligations, medical laboratories and healthcare profesionnals running and
providing services in such a laboratory are also subject to the French anti-gift rules, as recently revised. The anti-gift
framework is now governed by Articles L. 1453-3 et seq. and Articles R. 1453-2 to R. 1453-19 of the French Public Health
Code. The principle is that of a large prohibition of any transfer of value (in kind or in cash), direct or indirect, between
the companies (referred to in Article L. 1453-5 of the Public Health Code) and the beneficiaries (listed in Article L. 14534 of the Public Health Code) covered by the anti-gift framework, subject to specific exemptions).

The ban to grant benefits applies to all companies producing or marketing products covered by compulsory social security
schemes or health products mentioned in Article L. 5311-1 II of the Public Health Code such as medicines, medical devices,


-----

cosmetic products etc. The ban is further aimed at all “companies/persons providing health services”, which notably include
natural or legal persons carrying out an activity covered by an authorization, approval or declaration scheme provided for
in Part 6 of the Public Health Code (i.e. Health Establishments and Services). This covers medical laboratories which are
therefore subject to the anti-gift rules.

Consequently, medical laboratories are not allowed to offer benefits, and healthcare profesionals running / providing
services in such laboratories (eg medical biologists) are not allowed to receive them, subject to the exceptions set forth in
the anti-gift regulations.

By way of derogation, only certain benefits can be offered subject to strict conditions and formalities (Article L. 1453-7 of
the Public Health Code):

� Fees or payments in relation to research, consulting and, more generally, service agreements, provided that the
fees are proportional to the service rendered;

� Gifts, in cash or in kind, for research, research valuation or scientific assessment activities;

� Prizes or competitions to reward scientific research;

� Research grants;

� Gifts to healthcare professional associations, except in case the main purpose is unrelated to the professional
activity;

� Hospitality provided during promotional, professional or scientific events, provided that the hospitality is
reasonable, limited to the main professional and scientific objective of the event, and is not extended to persons
other than recipients listed in Article L. 1453-4 of the Public Health Code;

� Funding to promote continuing medical education;

Non-compliance with the anti-gift regulations may be sanctioned by up to two years of imprisonment and be subject to a
criminal fine of up to €750,000. This amount can be increased to 50% of the value of the benefits constituting the offence.
Ancillary sanctions may also apply, such as a ban on participating in public tenders, the suspension of business activities,
or the closing of facilities.

**_Laboratory Ownership and Corporate Structure_**

French law also contains specific provisions dealing with the corporate form through which a medical laboratory can be
operated and imposes limitations on who can hold the capital stock and exercise the voting rights within such corporations.
These provisions and limitations reflect the traditional view in France that medical laboratories are engaged in medical
activity conducted through small, privately owned entities by independent professionals (profession libérale).

Owners of a medical laboratory who do not want to operate their laboratory directly can incorporate their business through
a non-profit organization, a société civile professionnelle (“SCP”) or a cooperative undertaking or SEL. SELs can take
several forms: société d’exercice libéral à responsabilité limitée (“SELARL”), société d’exercice libéral à forme anonyme
(“SELAFA”), société d’exercice libéral en commandite par actions (“SELCA”) or SELAS Another specific corporate
form is the _société de participations financières de professions libérales_ (“SPFPL”), which cannot directly operate a
medical laboratory but may serve as a holding company for SELs. All our French medical laboratories are incorporated as
SELAS or SELAFA.

The following principles apply to SELs in general:

� a medical biologist can only act as a responsible medical biologist for, and therefore manage, one SEL;


-----

� more than half of the share capital and the voting rights must be held by medical biologists practicing within the
SEL or by an SPFPL constituted by the medical biologists practicing within the SEL. French law used to provide
for an exception whereby more than 50% of the share capital of a laboratory company could be held by individuals
or legal entities which were external medical biologists or laboratory companies if these individuals or entities
had an activity within the corporate purpose of the laboratory company considered or were SPFPL. However, law
n° 2013-442 dated May 30, 2013 related to the reform of medical biology has removed this exception, such change
only affecting laboratory companies set up after its enactment, _i.e._ after May 31, 2013. Consequently, any
laboratory company set up after that date is subject to the following limitation regarding its ownership: more than
50% of its share capital and voting rights must be held, directly or indirectly through an SPFPL, by medical
biologists working within the laboratory company considered. With regards to laboratory companies set up prior
to May 31, 2013, which, at that date, did not comply with this requirement, they can still benefit from the former
exception regarding ownership by external medical biologists and laboratory companies (grandfather clause).
However, in case of transfer of their shares, priority shall be given to medical biologists working within the
laboratory company considered. If the latter are unable to buy such shares, said shares can be sold to any external
medical biologist or laboratory company or SPFPL, or—within the limitations provided by law for the
shareholding of laboratory companies by non-biologists—to persons who are not medical biologists and legal
entities that are not laboratory companies;

� persons who are not medical biologists and legal entities that are not laboratory companies cannot directly hold
more than 25% of the share capital and voting rights of a SEL (except for SELCAs, for which this proportion shall
be more than 25% but must be less than 50%); to prevent conflicts of interest, certain types of professionals or
entities (including other health professionals, medical suppliers, pension funds and insurance companies, and
persons or entities holding a stake of more than 10% of certain of these restricted professions or businesses) are
prevented from holding shares in an SEL directly or indirectly;

� the number of medical biologists practicing within a medical laboratory, holding a fraction of the share capital
and working at least half-time in this medical laboratory must be equal to or greater than the number of branch
offices in that laboratory company;

� at least once a year, the company must provide the Ordre des Pharmaciens and/or the Ordre des Médecins with
a statement regarding the composition of its share capital;

� a shareholder may not provide the laboratory company with a sum that exceeds three times the amount of its
participation in the capital (in case of a professional shareholder practicing within the laboratory company or its
entitled persons); one time the amount of its participation in the capital (for other shareholders), being specified
that, in case of breach, there is no specific sanction;

� the transfer of shares is subject to the specific majorities (in a SELARL: majority of three-quarters of the practicing
shareholders; in a SELAFA (according to the articles of association): majority of two-thirds for the practicing
shareholders or of two-thirds of the members of the supervisory board/board of directors practicing within the
SEL; in a SELCA: majority of two-thirds of the associés commandités; in a SELAS: majority of two-thirds of the
practicing shareholders).

� the articles of association of laboratory companies may provide for the inalienability of shares for a period not
exceeding ten years; and

� finally, in order to be enforceable (opposable), all arrangements concerning laboratory companies or their
shareholders that are not contained in the bylaws must be disclosed to, as the case may be, the _Ordre des_
_Pharmaciens and/or the Ordre des Médecins._

Certain aspects of the legal framework described above have been considered by the European Court of Justice. In March
2009, the European Commission commenced a proceeding against France, challenging two provisions of French law. First,
the Commission argued that the 25% ownership limitations placed on third-party non-professionals imposed an undue
burden on the freedom of establishment provided for in the Treaty Establishing the European Community. Second, the


-----

Commission criticized as overly restrictive the rule by which qualified entities or individuals could not own shares in more
than two SELs. In its December 16, 2010 decision (Case C-89/09, European Commission v French Republic), the European
Court of Justice found in favor of France on the first count, holding that the ownership limitations placed on nonprofessionals were reasonable in view of the state’s legitimate public health and safety concerns. The Court noted the threat
to such independence that might arise from financial pressures placed on medical biologists by third-party investors and
found that a Member State might validly conclude that the professional independence of medical biologists would not be
adequately preserved in structures where such professionals would only hold a minority of the share capital, regardless of
whether they were granted majority voting rights. The Court found against France on the second count, however, holding
that the ownership restriction placed by existing regulations on qualified professionals was unnecessary and
disproportionate to the public health objectives sought to be achieved. Pursuant to decree n° 2013-117 dated February 5,
2013 related to the conditions of operation of a laboratory by an SEL, individuals or legal entities who have an activity
within the corporate purpose of the SEL are no longer subject to the limitation according to which they could not own
shares in more than two SELs

**Belgium**

**_Pricing and Reimbursement_**

With respect to pricing and reimbursement for medical lab testing in Belgium, medical laboratories are bound by the prices
and reimbursement tariffs set by the Belgian government and RIZIV/INAMI. Prices are revised annually through
negotiations between healthcare providers and health insurance providers, organized in various committees within
RIZIV/INAMI, and finally approved by the Minister of Health. For the recent changes in the government regulated lab
testing prices, see “Industry—Medical Laboratory Testing,” “Industry—Market Overview” and “Industry—Belgium”.

Reimbursements by RIZIV/INAMI are only granted to medical laboratories that have been accredited by the Belgian
government (in accordance with the Royal Decree of December 3, 1999 on the accreditation of medical biology laboratories
and the Royal Decree of December 5, 2011 on the accreditation of pathological anatomy laboratories). Currently, the
pricing system includes a “claw-back” mechanism which allows the Belgian government to recover budgetary overspend
in future periods. Reimbursement levels for tests included in the RIZIV/INAMI catalog are set by the RIZIV/INAMI. In
certain cases (i.e., only when the laboratories are not “conventionalized” (geconventioneerd/conventionné)), laboratories
are allowed to bill a small supplemental administrative fee per patient in addition to the set price for a test. Laboratory tests
that are prescribed for non-therapeutic reasons may be excluded from the RIZIV/INAMI’s price regulation and are set
freely by individual laboratories.

**_Quality and Accreditation Standards_**

RIZIV/INAMI also requires that medical laboratories of pathological anatomy operating in Belgium must meet certain
operational standards set forth by BELAC, the Belgian national accreditation organization. Laboratories are subject to an
inspection every year during the first 3-year period of accreditation. During the third year of the initial 3-year accreditation
period, BELAC will conduct an inspection to verify whether the medical laboratory complies with the requirements for a
5-year renewal period of the accreditation. During each such 5-year renewal period, BELAC will conduct minimum three
inspections (every 18 months at the latest) to verify compliance with BELAC’s standards.

**_Laboratory Ownership and Corporate Structure_**

The conditions with respect to ownership and corporate structure which medical laboratories must comply with are set
forth in Royal Decree No. 143 of December 30, 1982. In the case of medical laboratories operated by individuals, there is
an explicit prohibition on the operation of such laboratories by doctors who dispense prescriptions. Such doctors are also
barred from acting as directors, associates (vennoten/associés), members, managers (zaakvoerders/gérants) or designated
representatives of medical laboratory companies.

Legal form of ownership represents the primary regulatory constraint on the establishment and operation of medical
laboratories. These regulatory constraints are provided by the Royal Decree of April 26, 2007. The Royal Decree of April
26, 2007, which implements Article 3 §1(2) of Royal Decree No. 143 of December 30, 1982, lists the legal forms that


-----

medical laboratory companies should take in order to be eligible for reimbursement by the Belgian public health insurance
system. The duration of this Royal Decree, which was initially due to expire on December 31, 2009, has been extended
until December 31, 2012 by a Royal Decree of January 27, 2010. To date, no new extension has been enacted. The relevant
agencies have not shown any indication that reimbursements would cease. The current legal gap should be filled by a new
Decree which, to date, is still in a draft form and should be submitted to the Belgian government for approval. According
to oral sources at Sciensano (the former Scientific Institute of Public Health), this new Decree should (i) leave unchanged
the four legal forms that medical laboratories should take in order to be eligible for reimbursement by the Belgian public
health insurance system and (ii) will provide that these rules are no longer subject to expiration. Note that this information
has been obtained by unofficial sources at Sciensano and it is currently unclear whether and when a new Decree will be
adopted and, if so, what its content will be. The absence of any form of extension of the duration of the Royal Decree of
April 26, 2007 could have a significant impact on all Belgian laboratories run under the same corporate form as ours,
including us. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry – _We operate in a highly regulated_
_sector. Compliance with regulations applicable to our activities may increase our costs or restrict our activities. Failure_
_to comply with such regulations may lead to penalties of various types. Future alterations to regulations applicable to us_
_may have a material adverse impact on our activities.”_

The Royal Decree of April 26, 2007, specifies that, in addition to hospitals, universities and other public bodies, only
certain legal entities may operate medical laboratories, namely civil companies incorporated in the form of a BV/SRL
(besloten vennootschap _/société à responsabilité limitée), a general partnership (vennootschap onder firma/société en nom_
_collectif), a cooperative company (coöperatieve vennootschap/société coopérative) or a non-profit legal entity_
_(rechtspersoon zonder winstoogmerk/personne morale sans but lucratif)._

The provisions of Belgian company law applicable to Belgian companies that are eligible to operate medical laboratories
in accordance with the Royal Decree impose certain restrictions on the transferability of the shares of such companies. For
example, any contemplated transfer of shares in a BV/SRL must be consented to by half of the shareholders holding shares
representing 75% of the capital of the company (minus the value of the shares which are being transferred). There are no
requirements as to the legal form of an entity purchasing shares of a BV/SRL. Belgian law does not provide for any specific
rules with respect to the voting rights attached to the shares of a laboratory company.

In addition to restrictions on corporate form and share transferability, the Royal Decree of December 30, 1982, and the
Royal Decree of April 26, 2007, set forth additional general regulations affecting a laboratory company’s conduct. Among
other things, such rules stipulate that:

� the laboratory company must not have a corporate or statutory purpose other than the operation of medical
laboratories;

� the articles of association of a laboratory company must include a provision to the effect that the company is
required to strive for a standard of quality that avoids any act entailing complementary expenses which are not
justified by the compulsory healthcare insurer, by the patient or by the persons who insure the payment of these
services (to the extent that the Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 remains applicable after January 1, 2013);

� the laboratory company is required to conclude a written agreement (subject to approval by the Minister of Health)
with any persons performing services on its behalf which should minimally include (i) the financial provisions
applicable to the laboratory activity and (ii) the working conditions under which the providers carry out their
activities in the laboratory, including their free choice to perform such services as they wish and their access to
all means necessary to guarantee the quality of the services rendered (in particular the equipment, the personnel
and the method to be applied);

� the laboratory company is required to organize a central collection of fees and other compensations paid by
patients or third parties;

� the laboratory company may not (i) accord any benefits, directly or indirectly, to medical professionals who
dispense prescriptions, and (ii) influence these professionals in any way; and


-----

� the laboratory company must provide the Minister of Health with an annual list of its members or associates
(vennoten/associés) and must maintain separate accounting records, prepared in accordance with accounting
standards set by the Royal Decree of November 18, 1983.

**_Professional Licensing and Ethics_**

Similarly to France, medical biologists, technicians and laboratory personnel collecting patient samples in Belgium must
meet certain minimum professional qualifications. The Coordinated Law of May 10, 2015 regarding the practice of health
professions includes the essential requirements governing the practice of paramedical professions. Since 2019 new
requirements for medical laboratory technologists have been set forth in a Royal Decree of January 17, 2019.

**Description of Other Indebtedness**

_The following summary of certain provisions of the documents listed below governing certain of our indebtedness does not_
_purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents._

**Senior Facilities Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

In connection with the Refinancing, the Issuers will, on or prior to the Issue Date, enter into the Senior Facilities Agreement
with, among others, the Senior Notes Issuer as original guarantor, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer as company, original
borrower and original guarantor; J.P. Morgan AG, BNP Paribas and Natixis as global active coordinators and mandated
lead arrangers, Citibank London NA, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft,

which in each case will be subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio.

After a period of nine months following the Issue Date, the margin applicable to the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving
Credit Facility will be subject to adjustment by reference to the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as shown
in the then most recent compliance certificate, to equal the respective rate per annum set out in the following table:

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving Credit Facility
from the Issue Date to the end of the availability period applicable of the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 30% of the
applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. Commitment fees will be payable in the last day of each successive
period of three months starting from the Issue Date to (i) the end of the availability period or (ii) the day on which the
commitment of the relevant Revolving Credit Facility Lender is cancelled.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

**_Repayments_**

The Term Loan Facility will be repaid in full on the date which is seven years from the Issue Date. In respect of the
Revolving Credit Facility, each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto, subject to an
ability to roll over cash drawings. All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the date
falling 6.5 years after the Issue Date. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility
may be reborrowed, subject to certain conditions.

**_Mandatory Prepayment_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement will permit voluntary prepayments to be made (subject to de minimis amounts) and will
require mandatory prepayment in full or in part in certain circumstances, including:

_Full prepayment:_

� on a change of control of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (it being specified that the specified change of control
exception will not be applicable in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility) or disposal (whether in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all the assets or business of the TLB Group
(in each case such mandatory prepayment shall only apply upon a lender exercising its individual right to be repaid
within the prescribed time period); and

� on an admission to trading of all or any part of the securities issued by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any
member of the TLB Group or of any holding company thereof on any regulated market or an initial public offering
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any member of the TLB Group or any holding company thereof.

_Partial prepayment:_

� for each financial year (commencing with the financial year ending on 31 December 2022 and a first payment
thereunder to be made during the financial year ending on 31 December 2023), a percentage of excess cash flow
exceeding the higher of (i) €59,000,000, and (ii)15% of the Consolidated EBITDA which percentage decreases
as the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio decreases.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Facilities are guaranteed by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the
other Original TLB Borrowers (the “Senior Credit Facilities Guarantors”) and are secured by first ranking pledges over

Credit Facilities Guarantors or Biogold (as applicable) on the Issue Date; (ii) the bank accounts of Biogold, (iii) the bank
accounts of each Senior Credit Facilities Guarantor; (iv) the intra-group receivables owed to Biogold and (v) the intragroup receivables owed to each Senior Credit Facilities Guarantor.

Agreement will require (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to ensure that (x) each member of the TLB Group which is a
Material Company (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) accedes as a guarantor under the Senior Facilities
Agreement and (y) other members of the TLB Group be guarantors under the Senior Facilities Agreement so that the
aggregate EBITDA and gross assets of the guarantors under the Senior Facilities Agreement be at least equal to 80% of
Consolidated EBITDA and total gross assets of the TLB Group (the “Guarantor Coverage Test’’). The Guarantor
Coverage Test will be tested (i) for the first time on the date which is 90 days after the Issue Date; and (ii) then annually
on the date falling 90 days after the date when the annual audited financial statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer

governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

In connection with the entry into the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indentures, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and certain other members of the Group, will enter into an intercreditor agreement to govern the
relationships on certain matters and relative priorities, among, inter alios, the holders of Senior Secured Debt (as defined
below), the holders of Second Lien Debt (as defined below), the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt (as defined below),
certain intra group lenders and subordinated creditors (as all such capitalized terms are defined below) (the “Intercreditor
**Agreement”) with, amongst others, Natixis as Senior Facilities agent, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as original Senior Notes**
Trustee, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as original Senior Secured Notes Trustee, Elavon Financial Services DAC as Security
Agent and the Senior Facilities lenders.

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things:

� the relative ranking of certain debt (including debt incurred under the Senior Facilities and the Notes) of the
debtors;

� the relative ranking of Transaction Security (defined below) granted by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its
restricted subsidiaries (the "SSN Group") and the Senior Notes Issuer in its capacity as security provier;

� when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the SSN Group;

� when enforcement action (including acceleration and/or demand for payment and certain similar actions) can be
taken in respect of certain indebtedness of the SSN Group;

� the terms pursuant to which certain indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency
events;

� the order for applying proceeds from the enforcement of security, including the Transaction Security (defined
below), and other amounts received by the Security Agent; and

turnover provisions.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions related to future indebtedness permitted by the Indenture that may be
incurred by (a) the Senior Notes Issuer and (b) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries which are
guarantors (in relation to indebtedness under paragraph (i) below) which may be secured by the Collateral securing the
Senior Secured Notes, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any finance documentation then existing
(including the Indentures). Such indebtedness will (i) have equivalent rights to (A) the holders of the Senior Secured Notes,
(B) the holders of the Senior Facilities liabilities and (C) hedge counterparties holding certain hedging liabilities (which


-----

are permitted to benefit from pari passu ranking as set out in the Description of the Senior Secured Notes contained herein)
(such hedge counterparties being “Hedge Counterparties”), under the Intercreditor Agreement and may vote in the same
class of creditors as the holders of the Senior Secured Notes liabilities, the holders of the Senior Facilities and the Hedge
Counterparties in respect of enforcement (such indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Senior Secured Notes,
indebtedness under the Senior Facilities and indebtedness owed to the Hedge Counterparties, being the “Senior Secured
**Debt”), (ii) have rights in respect of such indebtedness that will be limited as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (such**
indebtedness being the “Second Lien Debt”) including in respect of (A) when payments in respect of such indebtedness
are permitted to be made, including the circumstances when payments in respect of Second Lien Debt can be suspended
(including through the issuance of a stop notice (and cure provisions in respect thereof)), (B) restrictions on when the
holders of Second Lien Debt can take enforcement action (including standstill provisions in respect of Second Lien Debt)
and (C) the ability of the holders of Second Lien Debt to purchase Senior Secured Debt in certain circumstances or (iii) have
equivalent rights to the holders of the Senior Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement and may vote in the same class of
creditors as the holders of the Senior Notes liabilities in respect of enforcement (such indebtedness, including indebtedness
under the Senior Notes, being the “Senior Subordinated Debt”), it being specified that such Senior Subordinated Debt
will have rights in respect of such indebtedness incurred by members of the SSN Group as guarantee obligations that will
be limited as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement including in respect of (A) when payments by members of the SSN
Group in respect of such indebtedness are permitted to be made, including the circumstances when payments in respect of
Senior Subordinated Debt can be suspended (including through the issuance of a stop notice (and cure provisions in respect
thereof)), (B) restrictions on when the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt can take enforcement action (including
standstill provisions in respect of Senior Subordinated Debt); provided that the Intercreditor Agreement does not purport
to restrict holders of Senior Subordinated Debt to take enforcement action against the Senior Notes Issuer or any person
which is not a member of the SSN Group and (C) the ability of the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt to purchase Senior
Secured Debt and Second Lien Debt in certain circumstances.

As set forth in “—Ranking and priority” below, any Second Lien Debt will be subordinated to any Senior Secured Debt
and any Senior Subordinated Debt guarantees granted by members of the SSN Group will be subordinated to the Senior
Secured Debt and the Second Lien Debt on the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. Any Second Lien Debt must be bullet
and its maturity date must be at least six months after the latest maturity date of any Senior Secured Debt (excluding under
any hedging agreement) and the issuer or borrower of Second Lien Debt must be the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Any
Senior Subordinated Debt must be bullet and its maturity date must be at least six months after the latest maturity date of
any Second Lien Debt, or if no such Second Lien Debt is in existence at that time, any Senior Secured Debt (excluding
under any hedging agreement) and the issuer or borrower of any Senior Subordinated Debt must be the Senior Notes Issuer.

By accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate
the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it, and not the discussion that
follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes.

_Ranking and priority_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that (1) the liabilities owing to the holders of Senior Secured Debt rank pari passu
in right and priority of payment between themselves and in priority to (A) the holders of Second Lien Debt, (B) the holders
of Senior Subordinated Debt (including all liabilities under any loan that would be made by any entity which is not a
member of the SSN Group for the purposes of on-lending the proceeds of any Senior Subordinated Debt to the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer (the “Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan”)) and (C) all intra-SSN Group liabilities required to be
subordinated as per the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Intra-SSN Group Liabilities”) and liabilities owed by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to any Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subordinated creditor (including to the Senior Notes
Issuer (other under any Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan)), (2) the liabilities owing to the holders of Second Lien Debt
rank _pari passu in right and priority of payment between themselves and in priority to the Senior Subordinated Debt_
(including all liabilities under any Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan) and all Intra-SSN Group Liabilities and liabilities
owed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to any Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subordinated creditor (including to the
Senior Notes Issuer (other under any Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan)) and (3) the liabilities owing to the holders of


-----

Senior Subordinated Debt (including all liabilities under any Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan) rank pari passu in right
and priority of payment between themselves and in priority to all Intra-SSN Group Liabilities and liabilities owed by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer to any Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subordinated creditor (including to the Senior Notes
Issuer (other under any Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan)).

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities owing to the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt rank
in priority to all liabilities owed by the Senior Notes Issuer to any Senior Notes Issuer’s subordinated creditor.

The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank the Intra-SSN Group Liabilities or the liabilities owed by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer to any Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subordinated creditor (including to the Senior Notes Issuer
(other under any Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan)) as between themselves.

The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank the liabilities owed by the Senior Notes Issuer to any Senior Notes
Issuer’s subordinated creditor as between themselves.

The Intercreditor Agreement does not rank or restrict the payment by the Senior Notes Issuer of any liabilities arising under
or in connection with any agreement or instrument in respect of Senior Secured Debt or Second Lien Debt.

_Guarantees and security_

The lenders under the Senior Facilities, the hedge counterparties, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and other holders
of Senior Secured Debt, any holders of the Second Lien Debt and the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt may subject to
certain limits benefit from a common guarantee and security package (the “Transaction Security”). The liabilities owing
to the Senior Facilities lenders, the hedge counterparties, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the other holders of
Senior Secured Debt, the holders of Second Lien Debt and the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt may, to the extent
permitted under applicable law and subject to certain limits be guaranteed by the same debtors and will be secured by the
same Transaction Security. To the extent permitted by the Indenture, holders of Senior Secured Debt, Second Lien Debt
and/or Senior Subordinated Debt (together, the “Secured Parties”) are entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to
receive the benefit of such Transaction Security on the basis set forth in “—Ranking and priority” above.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains covenants restricting holders of Senior Secured Debt, Second Lien Debt and/or
Senior Subordinated Debt from taking any additional guarantees or security from the SSN Group unless given for the
benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes subject to the Agreed Security Principles. Unless there is a legal
restriction on doing so, the Security Agent shall hold the Transaction Security for the benefit of the Secured Parties to the
extent each has the benefit of the relevant Transaction Security.

The holders of Senior Subordinated Debt may benefit from (i) security over the shares held in the Senior Notes Issuer and
its respective affiliates and over the rights owed under any shareholder loan to any holding company of the Senior Notes
Issuer and (ii) the assets, rights and related proceeds owned by the Senior Notes Issuer which are not subject to Transaction
Security granted in favour of the Security Agent as trustee and/or agent for the account of the holders of Senior Secured
Debt and the holders of Second Lien Debt in their capacities as Secured Parties, and excluding for the avoidance of doubt,
in each case, any Transaction Security (the “Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security”). In addition, the holders of Senior
Subordinated Debt may benefit from guarantees granted by affiliates of the Senior Notes Issuer other than the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries.

_Priority of security_

The Transaction Security shall rank and secure the liabilities in respect of Senior Secured Debt, Second Lien Debt and/or
Senior Subordinated Debt (but only to the extent such Transaction Security is expressed to secure those liabilities and
irrespective of the date on which such Transaction Security was created and/or perfected) in the following order: firstly the
liabilities in respect of Senior Secured Debt pari passu and without any preference between them; secondly the liabilities
in respect of the Second Lien Debt pari passu and without any preference between them; and thirdly the liabilities in respect
of the Senior Subordinated Debt pari passu and without any preference between them, with the proceeds of the Transaction
Security to be applied as described under “—Application of recoveries” below.


-----

The Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security shall rank and secure the liabilities in respect of Senior Subordinated Debt
_pari passu in right and priority of payment and without any preference between them (but only to the extent such Senior_
Subordinated Debt Only Security is expressed to secured such Senior Subordinated Debt).

_Restrictions on payments_

Prior to the final discharge date of all Senior Secured Debt, there shall be no restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement
on payments to be made to holders of Senior Secured Debt, save that the Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions
regulating payments in respect of hedging liabilities due to Hedge Counterparties following the occurrence of an
acceleration event in respect of the senior secured liabilities or an insolvency event in relation to a member of the SSN
Group.

Payments of liabilities to holders of Second Lien Debt by debtors and third party security providers shall be permitted (i) to

Lien Debt relating to cancellation and repayment in relation to a single lender or noteholder, cancellation in relation to a
defaulting lender or noteholder, tax gross up and indemnities or increased costs, (y) is of any amount due under any fee
letter or syndication strategy letter relating to any Second Lien Debt in each case payable on the issue date or utilization
date of the relevant Second Lien Debt or (z) cash interest (including default interest) in accordance with the terms of the
relevant agreement or instrument in respect of Second Lien Debt, (B) there is no payment event of default outstanding in
respect of any Senior Secured Debt and (C) a period of 120 days has elapsed or, as the case may be, such other applicable
period set out in the Intercreditor Agreement has elapsed following the occurrence of certain other material events of default
in respect of any Senior Secured Debt (the occurrence of which has been notified by the relevant representative, agent
and/or trustee of any Senior Secured Debt on or before the discharge of the Senior Secured Debt to the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, the Security Agent and the agent and/or trustee of any Second Lien Debt); (ii) the payment is of any of the
Second Lien Debt liabilities in accordance with any provision relating to illegality in respect of a lender/noteholder in the
relevant agreement or instrument in respect of Second Lien Debt; (iii) the payment is by way of capitalization of interest
or by the issuance of a non-cash pay financial instrument evidencing the same which is subordinated to the Senior Secured
Debt liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement on the same terms as the relevant Second Lien Debt liabilities;
(iv) if the payment is of an amount which is outstanding as a result of the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the
Second Lien Debt during the time period referred to in (i)(C) above, (v) if the payment is made following the occurrence

Debt liabilities as a result of those Second Lien Debt liabilities being released or otherwise discharged solely in
consideration for the issue of shares in the Senior Notes Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes (as applicable), to the extent
that (A) no cash or cash equivalent is made in respect of these liabilities, (B) if at the level of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, any liability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to the holders of any Second Lien Debt arising as a result of such
payment constitute equity investment or Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subordinated liabilities and are subordinated to the
Senior Secured Debt in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, (C) no member of the SSN Group
becomes liable for or incur any material tax liability as a result of such payment and a tax report from a reputable accountant
is provided to the Security Agent confirming that no such material tax lability has arisen or will arise; (D) no Change of
Control would arise as a result of such payment and (E) at the time that payment becomes effective, no distressed disposal
is due to occur which may be impeded by the occurrence of such payment, (vi) if the 50% majority of the holders of any
Senior Secured Debt have provided their prior consent, (vii) if the payment is of any amounts in respect of fees, costs and
expenses (including legal fees) payable to agent and/or trustee of any Second Lien Debt (or any adviser, receiver, delegate,
attorney, agent or appointee thereof) pursuant to the terms of the relevant agreement or instrument in respect of Second
Lien Debt; (viii) the payment is of necessary costs and expenses of any holder of Transaction Security in relation to the
protection, preservation or enforcement of such Transaction Security in respect of Second Lien Debt, (ix) if the payment
is of necessary consent and/or waiver fees in respect of any consent granted under, or waiver or amendment of any provision

paid to the holders of any Senior Secured Debt), (x) if the payment is of commercially reasonable advisory or other work
and professional fees, costs and expenses for restructuring advice and valuations (including legal advice and the advice of
other appropriate financial and/or restructuring advisors) in an aggregate amount not exceeding €2,000,000 (or its


-----

equivalent in any other currency or currencies), but excluding any fees incurred in connection with any current, threatened
or pending litigation against any holder of Senior Secured Debt (or any of their affiliate); and (xi) on or after final discharge
of the Senior Secured Debt.

Until final discharge of the Senior Secured Debt, the Senior Secured Issuer shall procure that no member of the Group shall
make, and no holder of Second Lien Debt may receive from any member of the Group, any payment in respect of Second
Lien Debt liabilities which would be permitted as per the above paragraph (other than any such Second Lien Debt permitted
payments referred to in paragraphs (ii) and/or (iii) above if: (i) a payment event of default in respect of any Senior Secured
Debt has occurred and is continuing or (ii) following the occurrence of certain other material event of default in respect of
any Senior Secured Debt which is continuing (other than a payment event of default in respect of any Senior Secured Debt)

Secured Debt (for the purpose of this paragraph, the "Relevant Representative") delivers a notice (a "Second Lien Debt
**Payment Stop Notice") specifying the event or circumstance in relation to that the relevant material event of default in**
respect of any Senior Secured Debt (other than a payment event of default in respect of any Senior Secured Debt) to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Security Agent and (to the extent that there is any Second Lien Debt outstanding at that
time) the agent or trustee under the relevant Second Lien Debt until the earliest of (A) the date falling 120 days after receipt
by the Relevant Representative of that Second Lien Debt Payment Stop Notice; (B) in relation to payments of Second Lien

_Consultation and enforcement of Transaction Security_

Subject to the paragraph below, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or
take any other enforcement action, the agents and/or trustee of the creditors represented in the instructing group concerned
shall consult with each other via their respective agent or directly in the case of any hedge counterparty (other than any
applicable agent and/or trustee in respect of Senior Subordinated Debt) and the Security Agent in good faith about the
instructions to be given by the instructing group for a period of up to 10 business days (or such shorter period as each other
creditor represented in the instructing group shall agree) (the “Consultation Period”), and only following the expiry of a
Consultation Period, shall the instructing group be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
Transaction Security or take any other enforcement action.

The creditors represented in the instructing group shall not be obliged to consult in accordance with the above paragraph
and the instructing group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security
or take any other enforcement action prior to the end of a Consultation Period if:

(a) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event; or

(b) the creditors constituting the instructing group (or the agent(s) and/or trustee of the creditors represented in the
instructing group) determine in good faith (and notify each agent and/or trustee and the Security Agent) that to
enter into such consultation and delay the commencement of enforcement of the Transaction Security could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(i) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Transaction Security; or

(ii) the realisation proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security.

_Consultation and enforcement of Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security_

If the Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security is being enforced pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Agent shall enforce the Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security in such manner as the majority of the holders of
Senior Subordinated Debt shall instruct or, in the absence of such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may
include taking no action).

_Payment of the Soulte_

If, following any Foreclosure:

(a) in connection with the enforcement of any French law governed Transaction Security, a Soulte is owed by the
Secured Parties to any debtor or third party security provider, that debtor or third party security provider agrees
that such Soulte shall only become due and payable by the Secured Parties (which have participated in the relevant
Foreclosure pro rata to the amount of liabilities owing to such Secured Parties which have been extinguished); or


-----

(b) in connection with the enforcement of any French law governed Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security, a Soulte
is owed by the relevant holder of Senior Subordinated Debt to any Senior Subordinated Debt independent obligor,
that Senior Subordinated Debt independent obligor agrees that such Soulte shall only become due and payable
by such holders of Senior Subordinated Debt (which have participated in the relevant Foreclosure pro rata to the
amount of liabilities owing to them have been extinguished),

on the earlier of (i) the date which is 12 months after the date on which such Foreclosure occurs and (ii) the final discharge
date.

Any payment of the Soulte to any debtor, third party security provider or Senior Subordinated Debt independent obligor,
as the case may be, which shall occur prior to the final discharge date, shall be made by the Security Agent in a bank
account in the name of such debtor, third party security provider or Senior Subordinated Debt independent obligor (as the
case may be) over which Transaction Security or Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security (as applicable) has been granted.
Such Transaction Security document or Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security (as applicable) shall include an mandate
in favour of the Security Agent from the relevant debtor, third party security provider or Senior Subordinated Debt
independent obligor (as applicable) to make from such pledged bank accounts any payment required to be under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any other secured Debt document.

_Marshalling_

Subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the holders of Senior Secured Debt undertake for the benefit of the
holders of Second Lien Debt and the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt not to enforce any pledge over a financial
instrument account or any other security interest granted in their favor but not in favor of the holders of Second Lien Debt
and the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt by any subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (the “Lower Senior
Securities”).

The senior secured creditors may enforce all or part of the Lower Senior Securities in the following cases:

(a) breach by a holder of Second Lien Debt or a holder of Senior Subordinated Debt of any obligation under the
Intercreditor Agreement resulting in the enforcement of any pledge over a financial instrument account granted
in favor of the holders of Senior Secured Debt, the holders Second Lien Debt and the holders of Senior
Subordinated Debt becoming impossible;

(b) breach by a holder of Second Lien Debt or a holder of Senior Subordinated Debt of any obligation towards the
holders of Senior Secured Debt under the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(c) enforcement of Transaction Security must be carried out in respect of shares of such entities and/or in respect of
such businesses of members of the SSN Group if in the opinion of the Security Agent (acting on behalf of all the
Secured Parties and in accordance with instructions from the Instructing Group) (as confirmed by an opinion from
an independent internationally recognized investment bank appointed by the Security Agent in accordance with
instructions from the Instructing Group (including the holders of Second Lien Debt and the holders of Senior
Subordinated Debt) which should consider the enforcement methods to be used), enforcement of the Lower Senior
Securities is reasonably expected to realize more value within a comparable timeframe for the Secured Parties as
a whole than enforcement of security granted in favor of the holders Senior Secured Debt, the holders of Second
Lien Debt and the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt (taking into account the expected enforcement costs, the
timing of enforcement and sale and the recovery rights of the Secured Parties (including the holders of Second
Lien Debt and the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt)).

_Additional and refinancing indebtedness_

In the event that any debtor incurs any additional indebtedness, or refinances existing indebtedness, that is permitted to be
designated as Senior Secured Debt, Second Lien Debt or Senior Subordinated Debt under the terms of Senior Secured Debt
finance documents, Second Lien Debt finance documents or Senior Subordinated Debt finance documents and entitled to
be secured by the Collateral securing the Notes, the liabilities in respect of such additional or refinancing liabilities, as the


-----

case may be, will share in the proceeds of any enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes on a pro rata or lower
ranking basis (as applicable) with the applicable group of creditors, provided that such creditor accedes to the Intercreditor
Agreement (if not already a party thereto), and provided further that the Security Agent other relevant creditors’
representatives shall be empowered to enter into promptly any new security document or promptly amend or waive any
terms of an existing Transaction Security document or Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security document (as the case may
be) and/or promptly release any asset from Transaction Security or Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security (as the case
may be) for this purpose, provided that (i) in relation to the grant of new Transaction Security or Senior Subordinated Debt
Only Security (as the case may be) (over assets, rights or interests, or classes or types of assets, rights or interests not
already the subject of an existing Transaction Security document or Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security document)
only, the obligations set out in this paragraph shall only extend to such Transaction Security or Senior Subordinated Debt
Only Security (as the case may be) that the Security Agent and relevant creditors’ representative are permitted to take and
hold under applicable law and/or the policies and rules of the Security Agent and relevant creditors’ representative in effect
at the time, and (ii) in relation to the release of existing Transaction Security or Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security
(as the case may be), (if legally possible and in the opinion of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (acting reasonably) it is
commercially feasible to do so and without breach of any term or condition of the relevant additional financing or
refinancing, additional or lower ranking Transaction Security or Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security (as the case may
be) shall be sought instead of release being given in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

_Option to purchase_

Following an acceleration event in respect of the Senior Secured Debt or the enforcement of any Transaction Security, any
holder of Second Lien Debt shall have an option (subject to the conditions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement) to
purchase all (and not only part) of Senior Secured Debt at par.

Following an acceleration event in respect of the Senior Secured Debt or in respect of the Second Lien Debt or the
enforcement of any Transaction Security, the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt holding more than 50% of Senior
Subordinated Debt credit participations shall have an option (subject to the conditions set out in the Intercreditor
Agreement) to purchase all (and not only part) of Senior Secured Debt and the Second Lien Debt at par.

**Finance Leases**

Certain of our subsidiaries are party to finance leases, which are entered mainly in connection with our testing equipment.
Our finance lease amounted to €18.4 million as of September 30, 2020. The finance leases are not subject to the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Hedging Obligations**

We have entered, and may continue from time to time to enter, into interest rate swap arrangements in order to hedge
against interest rate risk associated with our borrowings subject to floating rates of interest, including the Senior Facilities.
As the Notes have a fixed rate of interest, we do not anticipate entering into any interest rate hedges in connection therewith.

**Description of the Senior Secured Notes**

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”
under the heading “Certain Definitions”. For purposes of this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”, references to
the “Senior Secured Notes Issuer” are to CAB and not to any of its Subsidiaries, if any. References to “we” or “us” or
“our” are to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will issue €750 million aggregate principal amount of      % Senior Secured
Notes due 2028 (the “Initial Senior Secured Notes”). The Senior Secured Notes will be issued under an indenture to be
dated as of       , 2021 (the “Senior Secured Notes Indenture”), between the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, Biogold, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Elavon Financial
Services DAC, as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”), Elavon Financial Services DAC, as transfer agent (the “Transfer
**Agent”), Elavon Financial Services DAC, as registrar (the “Registrar”) and Elavon Financial Services DAC, as security**
agent (the “Security Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
the Senior Secured Notes and refers to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those
agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as Holders
of the Senior Secured Notes. Copies of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the forms of Senior Secured Notes, the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the
caption “Listing and General Information”.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to
understanding relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness,
procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of
security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent.

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered Holders will have rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect
to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have not been, and will not be, registered
under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—
_Unrestricted Subsidiary”, we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”._
Any future Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

**The** **Senior Secured Notes**

The Senior Secured Notes will:

      - be general senior obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

      - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including
Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations;

      - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including its Guarantee of
the Senior Notes;

      - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and its Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Senior Secured
Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation;


-----

      - be guaranteed by the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors as described under “—The _Senior Secured Note_
_Guarantees”;_

      - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer that are not Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, including obligations owed to trade creditors;

      - mature on        , 2028; and

      - be represented by one or more registered notes in global registered form, but in certain circumstances may
be represented by the relevant Senior Secured Definitive Registered Notes (see “Book-Entry, Delivery and
_Form”)._

**The Senior Secured Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

The Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed:

      - on the Issue Date by the Senior Notes Issuer, LBM Bioesterel, BPO-Bioépine, Bio Lam LCD, Unilians and
Biomer (collectively, the “Initial Guarantors”); and

      - within 60 days following the Issue Date by Medisch Labo Medina BV, Macsys NV, Centrum voor
Medische Analyse BV, Dyomedea-Neolab, Laborizon Maine Anjou, Biosynergie, Laborizon Centre,
Laborizon Bretagne and Astralab (collectively, the “Post-Closing Guarantors”),

each of which will be an obligor under the Senior Facilities within the same timeframes as described above. In
addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees,”
subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may
provide a Senior Secured Note Guarantee in the future. The Senior Secured Note Guarantees will be joint and several
obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors

The Senior Secured Note Guarantee of each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor will:

      - be a general senior obligation of that Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—
_Security”;_

      - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Senior Secured Note Guarantee,
including (a) Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations and (b) in
the case of the Senior Notes Issuer, Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Notes;

      - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Senior Secured Note Guarantee,
including its Guarantee of the Senior Notes;

      - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Senior Secured Note
Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation;
and

      - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor that are not Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, including obligations owed to trade
creditors.

The obligations of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor under its Senior Secured Note Guarantee will be limited as
necessary to prevent the relevant Senior Secured Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference,
transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit
rules, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of
corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law


-----

which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital
of the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor. Additionally, the Senior Secured Note Guarantees will be subject to
certain corporate law procedures being complied with. The Senior Secured Note Guarantees will be further limited as
required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply to and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favor
of obligations under the Senior Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes where, among other things, any such grant would
be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the cost of such grant
is disproportionate to the benefit to the creditors, including the Holders, of obtaining the applicable guarantee. By virtue
of these limitations, a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Secured Note Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor
may have effectively no obligation under its Senior Secured Note Guarantee.

As of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors in aggregate
represented approximately 64.4% of the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) and
74.7% of our pro forma total assets (including goodwill).

Claims of creditors of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, including trade
creditors and creditors holding debt and Guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred
stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Senior Secured Notes Guarantors generally will have priority
with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior
Secured Notes and each Senior Secured Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including
trade creditors) and preferred stockholders of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Senior Secured Notes Guarantors (if
any). Although the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities
that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.
See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”.

**_Senior Secured Note Guarantees Release_**

The Senior Secured Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will terminate and release:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the
relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company of such Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other
disposition;

(2) upon the sale or disposition (including by way of consolidation, amalgamation, combination or merger) of all or
substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor (other than to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer

Indenture;

(3) upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture of the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

triggered such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s obligation to guarantee the Senior Secured Notes under the
covenant described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”;

(6) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
relating to the release of a Senior Secured Note Guarantee upon an enforcement sale or other disposal of such
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor;

(7) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;


-----

(8) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization; or

(9) with respect to an entity that is not the successor Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, as a result of a transaction
permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”.

occurrence of an event described in clauses (4), (6), (7) and (9) above.

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions reasonably requested in writing by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Senior Secured Note Guarantee in accordance with
these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected by the Trustee and the Security Agent without the consent of or liability to the Holders or any other action or
consent on the part of the Trustee or the Security Agent.

Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes will mature on      , 2028. The Senior Secured Notes will be issued
in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

interest payment date it was most recently paid;

      - be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on        and        , commencing on        , 2021;

the related interest payment date;

      - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months; and

      - be calculated on the nominal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.

Interest on overdue principal, interest, premium or Additional Amounts will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher
than the rate of interest otherwise applicable to the Senior Secured Notes.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the place at
which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next
succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any
such delay.

“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer is permitted to issue additional Senior Secured Notes of the same or different series, which shall

(9) any relevant limitation language with respect to Senior Secured Note Guarantees and Security Documents.

All series of Additional Senior Secured Notes will be treated, along with all other Senior Secured Notes, as a
single class for the purposes of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other
matters which are not specifically distinguished for any applicable series; provided, that if the Additional Senior Secured
Notes are not fungible with the Senior Secured Notes originally issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such
Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities
identification number, as applicable, from the Senior Secured Notes originally issued. Unless the context otherwise
requires, for all purposes of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”,
references to “Senior Secured **Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Senior Secured Notes initially issued**
on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Senior Secured Notes. Additional Senior Secured Notes may be designated to
be of the same series as the Senior Secured Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms
substantially identical in all material respects to the Senior Secured Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, and shall be
deemed to form one series therewith, and references to the Senior Secured Notes shall be deemed to include the Senior
Secured Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any such Additional Senior Secured Notes.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Global Notes (as defined
below) will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by the registered Holder thereof (being the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Senior
**Secured Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents.**
In addition, interest on the Senior Secured Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, by bank transfer to the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Senior Secured Notes
for the Senior Secured Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes”
below.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Secured Notes
(including the initial Paying Agent). The initial Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC (the “Paying
**Agent”).The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the**
“Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC and the initial Transfer Agent will be
Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Senior Secured Notes
outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Senior Secured
Notes on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. A register of the Senior Secured Notes shall also be maintained at the
registered office of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. In case of inconsistency between the register of the Senior Secured
Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer at its registered office, the register kept
by the Registrar shall prevail.


-----

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Senior
Secured Notes without prior notice to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. However, for so long as the Senior
Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest
coupons, as follows:

   - each series of Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “Senior Secured **144A Global Notes”). The Senior Secured 144A Global**
Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream; and

   - each series of Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities
Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Senior Secured **Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Senior Secured 144A Global Notes,**
the “Senior Secured Global Notes”). The Senior Secured Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be
deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Senior Secured Global Notes (“Senior Secured Book-Entry Interests”) will be
limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such
participants.

Ownership of Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors”. In addition, transfers
of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear
and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by
Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of Senior Secured Book-Entry Interests in the Senior Secured Regulation S Global
Notes (the “Senior Secured Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon
delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Subject to the foregoing, Senior Secured Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of Senior Secured 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to
a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in
a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described
under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Senior Secured Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding
paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Senior Secured Book-Entry Interest in the Senior Secured Global Note from
which it was transferred and will become a Senior Secured Book-Entry Interest in the Senior Secured Global Note to
which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if
any, and other procedures applicable to Senior Secured Book-Entry Interests in the Senior Secured Global Note to which
it was transferred.

If Senior Secured Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Transfer Agent and the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Senior Secured Notes


-----

Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Senior Secured Book-Entry Interests. Senior Secured Definitive
Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Senior Secured Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in compliance with applicable
law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described
more fully under “Notice to Investors”.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Senior Secured
Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or
Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such
transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes
payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not required to register the transfer or
exchange of any Senior Secured Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the applicable Senior Secured Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of the applicable Senior Secured Notes
to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer
or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be
entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured by first priority security interests ranking pari passu with the security
interests securing the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations (subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement) over:

      - on the Issue Date, (i) share capital and other securities of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer held by the Senior
Notes Issuer; (ii) share capital and other securities of Biogold held by the Senior Notes Issuer; (iii) share
capital and other securities of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer held by Biogold; (iv) intercompany
receivables owed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; (v) bank accounts of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer;
(vi) share capital and other securities of Astralab, Bio Lam LCD, Biomer, LBM Bioesterel, Unilians,
Laborizon Maine Anjou, Laborizon Bretagne, Laborizon Centre, BPO-Bioépine, Biosynergie and
Dyomedea-Neolab; (vii) bank accounts of the Initial Guarantors; and (viii) intercompany receivables owed
to the Initial Guarantors; and

      - within 60 days following the Issue Date and subject to certain Agreed Security Principles, (i) share capital
of Medisch Labo Medina BV, Macsys NV and Centrum voor Medische Analyse BV; (ii) intercompany
receivables owed to the Post Closing-Guarantors; and (iii) bank accounts of the Post-Closing Guarantors.

The Collateral will also secure the liabilities of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors under the Senior Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations and any Additional Senior Secured Notes and may
also secure certain future Indebtedness, in each case on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Note Guarantees. Any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied pro
_rata in repayment of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior_
Facilities and any other Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred and secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured
Notes and Senior Secured Note Guarantees pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor


-----

Agreement. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to
the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this issuance
of Senior Secured Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Liens”, certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be_
limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles as described under “Description of
_Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement”._

For further information regarding limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally
available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting
the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law, see “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the Senior
Facilities, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders
of the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and (d) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness
permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents, which provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Senior Facilities, certain Hedging
Obligations and the Senior Secured Notes are secured equally and ratably by first priority Security Interests. In addition,
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the
Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement”, “—Release of Liens”, “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain_
_Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens”._

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors have
granted, or will grant, security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due and payable of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior
Secured Note Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Security Documents have been, or will be,
entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties or under the parallel
debt as the case may be. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent has acted in its own name, but
for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders of Senior Secured Notes from time to
time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as a security agent of the lenders under the
Senior Facilities, the trustee and the holders of Senior Notes and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that, to the extent permitted by the
applicable laws, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee
and the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured
Notes, except through the Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the enforcement of the
Collateral. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and Security Documents will permit the Trustee and/or the agent for any
Senior Facilities to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action under the Security Documents (following the
occurrence of an event of default under such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness being declared due and payable and the
Trustee having received, where required, the requisite approval or consent of the holders of such Indebtedness). See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees, as
applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the
Senior Secured Note Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security
Interests with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may be released under certain
circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens”.


-----

Subject to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Senior
Secured Notes, to freely operate the property and assets constituting Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any
income therefrom (including any and all dividends, distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments in respect of
Capital Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors that is part of the Collateral).

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or the
Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security
Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Senior Facilities or by certain hedge
counterparties. The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness
that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”.

The Security Agent will be appointed under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement to act as agent for certain
secured parties, including the creditors under the Senior Facilities, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by
the Collateral and the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents
securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents. The creditors under the Senior Facilities and the
counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have authorized the Security Agent to
(i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental
rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or
replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

In order to establish the relative rights of certain creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors under certain financing arrangements, including the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, the
Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Guarantors, the agent under the Senior Facilities, the Security Agent, the Trustee
and the trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture will enter into the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied pro rata
in repayment of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior
Facilities and any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred and secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes
and Senior Secured Note Guarantees pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that it will be subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement
and that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the Holders
of the Senior Secured Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and to give effect to its provisions.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Senior Secured Notes, by
accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements
and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security
Documents.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements”._


-----

**_Release of Liens_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to release the Security Interests
in respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to a Person that is not the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(2) upon a release of the Lien (the “Initial Lien”) that resulted in the creation of the Lien (the “Notes Lien”) under
the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” so long as
immediately after the release of the Notes Lien there is no other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the property
and assets that were the subject of the Initial Lien and Notes Lien that would result in the requirement for the
Senior Secured Notes to be secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, such Lien;

(3) in the case of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor that is released from its Senior Secured Note Guarantee
pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital
Stock, of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor;

(4) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(5) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as provided in “—
_Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(6) if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and
assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(7) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization;

(8) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include Collateral, or the sale or
transfer of such property or assets, which may include Collateral, in each case pursuant to a Qualified
Securitization Financing, CIR Financing or Receivables Facility; or

(9) in connection with any disposal of Collateral to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that such release is followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the_
same assets in a manner consistent with, and pursuant to applicable formalities under, the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”.

The Senior Notes Issuer and Biogold will be entitled to release the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral
directly owned by it pursuant to the provisions of clauses (4) and (5) above.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”.

The Security Agent and the Trustee will take all necessary action reasonably requested in writing by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured
Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document subject to customary protections and
indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the
Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release).

**Optional Redemption**

On and after         , 2024, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of
the Senior Secured Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice (except as permitted under “—Selection
_and Notice” below), at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus accrued and_
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right


-----

of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed
during the twelve-month period beginning on         of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**

2024 .................................................................................................................................................. %

2025 .................................................................................................................................................. %

2026 and thereafter ........................................................................................................................... 100.000%

Except as described below and except as described under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons” the Senior
Secured Notes are not redeemable until      , 2024.

Prior to      , 2024, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem in the
aggregate up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including the original principal
amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes of the same series), upon not less than 10 or more than 60 days’ notice,
with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption
price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of        % as of the date of the applicable redemption notice,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including the original principal
amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes of the same series) issued under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture remain outstanding after each such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

Prior to       , 2024, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a portion of the
Senior Secured Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice (except as permitted under “—Selection and
_Notice” below), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus the_
Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the
applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date).

In addition, at any time prior to        , 2024, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer may redeem, during each twelve-month period commencing on the Issue Date, up to 10% of the
original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional Senior
Secured Notes of the same series) at a redemption price equal to 103.0% of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the
right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers_**

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, all of the Senior Secured Notes, if holders of
not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes validly tender and do
not validly withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or any third
party making such tender offer in lieu of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such holders, then all holders will have been deemed to have consented to
such tender or other offer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ notice following such purchase date, to redeem all Senior Secured Notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other holder in such tender offer (excluding
any early tender or incentive fee), plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_General_**

We may repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or
otherwise. Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice”.


-----

If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer effects an optional redemption of Senior Secured Notes, it will, for so long as
Notes are listed on any securities exchange and the rules of such an exchange so require, inform the exchange of such
optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes that will remain outstanding
immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Senior Secured Note is registered at
the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Senior Secured
Notes will be subject to redemption by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Senior Secured Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity
Offering), any such redemption may, at the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more
conditions precedent. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may provide in any notice of redemption that payment
of the redemption price and the performance of its obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by
another Person; provided, however, that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will remain obligated to pay the redemption
price and perform its obligations with respect to such redemption in the event such other Person fails to do so. Notice of
any redemption in respect of an Equity Offering may be given prior to completion thereof.

If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects to redeem the Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof and, in
connection with a satisfaction and discharge or defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture in accordance with the
provisions set forth under “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge”, requests that the Trustee distribute to the
Holders amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include accrued and unpaid
interest to the date fixed for redemption) prior to the date fixed for redemption, the applicable redemption notice will
state that Holders will receive such amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee (i) on or promptly after the date fixed for
redemption or (ii) on such earlier payment date as selected by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

**_Mandatory Redemption_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund
payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Selection and Notice_**

If less than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the
Registrar will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis or in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or
Clearstream (as applicable), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements.
None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with
this paragraph.

For so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall publish notice of redemption in accordance with the prevailing rules of the Exchange
and in addition to such publication, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date (except as
permitted below), mail such notice to Holders of the Senior Secured Notes by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their
respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying
Agent. In the case of Global Notes, such notice of redemption may also be sent in accordance with the rules and
procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable). On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on the
Senior Secured Notes or the part of the Senior Secured Notes called for redemption.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Senior
Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Senior Secured
Definitive Registered Note, a new Senior Secured Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of any Senior Secured Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the
Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Senior Secured Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Senior
Secured Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Senior Secured Global Note to decrease the principal
amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption
notice, Senior Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. If such redemption is
subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the related notice may, for the avoidance of doubt, state
that, in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all
such conditions shall be satisfied or waived (provided that in no event shall such date of redemption be delayed to a date
later than 60 days after the date on which such notice was sent, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than


-----

60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or a
satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture), or such redemption may not occur and such notice
may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the redemption
date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time
upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under
“—Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date
as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer determines in good faith that, as a
result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change, or amendment to, the existing official written position or the introduction of an official written
position regarding in the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or
rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in
published practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the
next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes (but, in the case of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise
to such requirement cannot be made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such
payment without the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking
reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying
Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on
or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date
after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person,
after such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, with respect to a change or
amendment occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

A notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“—Selection and Notice”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than
90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts if
a payment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such
obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of
redemption of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver to the
Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of
facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that the Payor cannot avoid
its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an
independent tax counsel of recognized standing and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a
result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and
opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in
which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor
(including any successor entity) (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Senior
Secured Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on
account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:


-----

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured Note
Guarantee is made by or on behalf of the Payor or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or
therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or
otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax

(each of clauses (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required by law to be made
from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured
Note Guarantee, as applicable, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor
will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding
from such additional amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on
any such Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured Note Guarantee, as applicable, in the absence of such withholding or
deduction (the “Additional Amounts”); provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on
account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner of a Senior Secured Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial
owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability
company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but for the avoidance of doubt not
limited to, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business
or maintaining a permanent establishment in or being physically present in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but
excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership, holding or sale of such
Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior
Secured Note, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, a Senior Secured Note Guarantee, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or a Security Document;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner
of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a reasonable written request by the Payor addressed to the Holder,
after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be made), to provide
certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence, or identity of the
Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting
requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice
of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction of,
all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such
certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Senior Secured Note for
payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available
for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts
had the Senior Secured Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment under or with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, use, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment
or other governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to such Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured Note Guarantee to any
Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership (including any entity that is treated as a partnership for applicable tax
purposes) or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that the
beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership (or entity treated as a
partnership for applicable tax purposes) or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional
Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Note directly;

(7) any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, (the “Code”), as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version of such sections that


-----

are substantively comparable), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any official interpretations thereof, any
intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the
foregoing and any law, regulation, or official interpretation thereof implementing such intergovernmental
agreement, or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies
of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld to each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such
payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon
reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the relevant Paying Agent.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any
payment made on any Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of
such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will
be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent
to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts
arises or the Payor becomes aware less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may
deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on
such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:_

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a redemption of Senior Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured Note
Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any
other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect
thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (and in the case of enforcement, any jurisdiction) from the execution,
delivery, registration, issuance, or enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to, the Senior Secured Notes, any
Senior Secured Note Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or
instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Senior Secured Notes after the
initial resales by the Initial Purchasers pursuant to this Offering and limited, solely in the case of Taxes attributable to the
receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such Taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not
excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (7) above or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which
any successor to a Payor is organized or incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax
purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (or any Senior
Secured Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “Change of
_Control”, each Holder will have the right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal_


-----

to €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, if applicable; provided that Senior Secured Notes of
€100,000 or less, as the case may be, may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Senior Secured
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes repurchased, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);
_provided, however, that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase Senior Secured Notes as_
described under this heading, “Change of Control”, in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its
right to redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional
_Redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived._

Unless the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured
Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption
have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of the Senior Secured Notes, with a
copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase
price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of
Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of
**Control Payment”);**

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such
notice is mailed (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Senior Secured Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to
accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and
that any Senior Secured Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the
Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, consistent with the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Secured Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer
is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior
Secured Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of
Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior Secured Notes being purchased by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer in the Change of Control Offer.

A Holder willing to tender Senior Secured Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account
manager of its election, who shall in turn notify the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once such
tender has been accepted by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and notified to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall
promptly credit the bank account of such Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes so
tendered and deduct the corresponding amount of such Senior Secured Notes from such Holder’s Euroclear or
Clearstream (as applicable) account.


-----

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the
Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a
third party from seeking to acquire the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would
constitute a Change of Control.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of
Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with
the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such
Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be
made in advance of a Change of Control and conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a
Definitive Agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of
the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes
pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions
of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change
of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change
of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness at the option of each lender under the Senior
Facilities.

In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities may not constitute
a Change of Control under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require
such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to
require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a
repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such
repurchase on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Finally, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the
Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There
can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The definition of Change of Control includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to
specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is
no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of
“all or substantially all” of the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligation to
make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with
the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur any
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and any
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if, on the date of such Incurrence, after
giving pro forma effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof):

(a) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; and


-----

(b) to the extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured
Net Leverage Ratio would have been no greater than 5.75 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (“Permitted
**Debt”):**

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary under any Credit Facility
(including in respect of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder) in an
aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the sum of:

(a) (i) €1,500 million plus (ii) the greater of €386 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA (provided
that any amount of Permitted Debt Incurred by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary pursuant to this subclause (a)(ii) shall only be available under any revolving facility
(including under the Revolving Credit Facility and any increase in commitments under the Revolving
Credit Facility); plus

(b) an amount equal to the greater of €386 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA; plus

(c) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion
thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, accrued and unpaid interest, underwriting discounts, premiums
(including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such
refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted
to be Incurred by another provision of this covenant; provided that, if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is
subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes or a Senior Secured Note Guarantee, then the Guarantee must be
subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes or such Senior Secured Note Guarantee to the same extent as the
Indebtedness being guaranteed; or (b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens”,
Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is
permitted under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness
of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided, however, that:_

(a) if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor is the obligor on any such Indebtedness
and the obligee is a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, such
Indebtedness is unsecured and ((i) except in respect of intercompany current liabilities Incurred in
connection with the cash pooling and other cash management operations of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, (ii) to the extent legally
permitted (the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all
procedures required in the reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to
protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the subordination
of such Indebtedness) and (iii) if the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness (other than
Indebtedness that is outstanding for a period of less than 60 days) of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
such Subsidiary Guarantor owed to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor exceeds the greater of €20 million and 0.50% of Total Assets) expressly subordinated
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to the prior payment
in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, in the case of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, or the applicable Senior Secured Note Guarantee, in the case of a Subsidiary
Guarantor; and

(b) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such
Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary and any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an
Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;


-----

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Senior Secured Notes (other than any Additional Senior Secured
Notes) and the related Senior Secured Note Guarantees and any related “parallel debt” obligations
created under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents;

(b) any Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than
Indebtedness described in clauses (1), (2) or (4)(a) of this paragraph) outstanding on the Issue Date,
after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions (including any Guarantee by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Notes issued on the Issue Date and any Parent Debt
Contribution relating to such Senior Notes); and

(c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in clauses (4) and (5) of
this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant;

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (i) outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or
is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of
assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or
(ii) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to consummate the transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which any Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that, with respect to this clause (5), at the time
of such acquisition or other transaction and after giving pro forma effect to such acquisition or other transaction
and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness,

(a) either (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to clause (a) of the first paragraph of this covenant or (ii) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or
other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness; and

(b) to the extent that Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause 5(ii) constitutes Senior Secured
Indebtedness, either (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (b) of the first paragraph of this covenant or (ii) the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio would not be more than it was immediately prior to
giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness;

(6) Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary under Hedging Obligations not for
speculative purposes (including with respect to the Senior Notes and any Parent Debt) (as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consisting of (a) Capital Lease

lease, rental or cost of design, construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or
equipment that is used or useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the
Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds
such Indebtedness, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal
amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) and then outstanding, will not exceed at
any time the greater of €154 million and 3.86% of Total Assets;

(8) Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in respect of (a) workers’

for customary guarantees, indemnification, obligations in respect of earnouts or other adjustments of purchase
price or, in each case, similar obligations, in each case, Incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition
or disposition of any business or assets or Person or any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than Guarantees of

(14) Guarantees of Indebtedness of Persons other than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

time outstanding.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the
first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify,
and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and
type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) notwithstanding clause (1) above, all Indebtedness outstanding under (i) the Term Loan Facility on the Issue
Date and (ii) the Revolving Credit Facility at any time (and, in the case of both (i) and (ii), any refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof) shall be deemed Incurred under clause (1)(a) of the second paragraph of this
covenant and may not be reclassified;

(3) with respect to clauses (1) through (18) (other than clauses (1)(a) and (5)) of the second paragraph of this
covenant, if at any time that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to
have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, such
item of Indebtedness shall (unless otherwise elected by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) be automatically
reclassified into an item of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant;

(4) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular
amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (13) or (15) of
the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;


-----

(6) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption
or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(7) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting
such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other
provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(8) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” or “Total Assets” in relation to the second paragraph
of this covenant, Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets, as the case may be, shall be measured at the option of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on the most recent date on which new commitments are obtained or the date on
which new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case of revolving facilities) or the date on which new Indebtedness is
Incurred (in the case of term facilities) and, in the case of Consolidated EBITDA, for the period of the most
recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to such date for which such internal consolidated financial
statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer are available;

(9) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance
Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by
reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets (as applicable) at the time of Incurrence, if
such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets (as applicable)
restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets on the
date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets (as applicable) restriction, as
the case may be, shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums
(including tender premiums), defeasance costs and fees in connection with such refinancing;

(10) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the
amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP;

(11) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit
Facility or other revolving credit line, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a “cash sweep” or
“clean down” provision or any provisions that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically
shall only be deemed for the purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was
first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof; and

(12) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such Indebtedness,
such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and
expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs
and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the
form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations
not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for
purposes of this covenant. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value
thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation
preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be
Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Euro
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in
the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro Equivalent), in the
case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Euro, and such refinancing would cause the


-----

applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of
Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the
Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any
such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the
Euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in Euro will
be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

In the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases
commitments under a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to
Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (28) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all
purposes under the Indenture, including for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of clauses (1)
through (18) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above for borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder
(and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined (i) on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or
increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof (or, at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a
portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness (in each case, pursuant to any letter, agreement
or instrument, which may be conditional, including as to documentation) and/or (ii) on the date on which such facility or
commitments become available, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount
permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a
date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for
purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured
Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of the usage of clauses (1) through (18) above shall be deemed to be
Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any
such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may revoke such determination
at any time and from time to time.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is
denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor any Subsidiary Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including
Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment
to the Senior Secured Notes and the applicable Senior Secured Note Guarantee, if any, on substantially identical terms;
_provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other_
Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by
virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the
application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly,
to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s or

maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption,

second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”);

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made subsequent to the

Income is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit);

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined in accordance with

employees to the extent funded by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the Issue Date of any
Indebtedness that has been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or Subordinated Shareholder
Funding (plus the amount of any cash, and the fair market value of property or assets or marketable

clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s option) included in any of the foregoing
clause (iv), (v) or (vi); provided further that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts (such amounts, the
“Excluded Amounts”) that would otherwise be included in the calculation of the amount available for
Restricted Payments pursuant to the preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts result
from the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities received in contemplation

such Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities and (3) no Change of Control Offer is
made in connection with such Change of Control in accordance with the requirements of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture.

Senior Secured Notes Issuer in good faith.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

conversion right or privilege in connection with which cash is paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares)

Senior Secured Notes Issuer) of, Capital Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock
or Designated Preference Shares), Subordinated Shareholder Funding or a substantially concurrent contribution
to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares or through
an Excluded Contribution) of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; provided, however, that to the extent so applied,

Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Funding or such contribution will be excluded from clause (c)(ii) of
the first paragraph of this covenant;

any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment shall
be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or portion
thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Restricted Payments described in clauses (1) through (22)
above, or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the clauses in the definition
of “Permitted Investment”, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be entitled to divide or classify
such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date made or later divide or reclassify such Restricted
Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant (including as a Permitted
Investment).

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
create, Incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits
therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property
or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted
Liens if the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or a Senior Secured Note Guarantee in the
case of Liens of Senior Secured Notes Guarantors) are directly secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles (but
without regard to any Agreed Security Principles limiting the types of assets that may be pledged to secure the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture), equally and ratably
with, or senior in priority to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by
such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that
constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Holders of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding
paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the
Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens”.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness.
The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection
with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of
interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation
preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate
of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness need
not be permitted solely by reference to one category of Permitted Liens described in the definition of “Permitted Liens”
or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant but may be permitted in part under any combination thereof and (B) in
the event that a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of the
categories of Permitted Liens described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or
reclassify, such Lien securing each item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this
covenant and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Lien or such item of Indebtedness secured by
such Lien in one of the clauses of the definition of “Permitted Liens” and such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness
will be treated as being incurred or existing pursuant to only one of such clauses or pursuant to the first paragraph hereof.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise
cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any Indebtedness
or other obligations owed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) make any loans or advances to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(c) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application
of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, shall not be
deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities) and any other
agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date, (b) the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Documents, the Senior Notes Security Documents or any related security documents or

Subsidiaries in each case, in effect on the Issue Date;

Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was acquired by or
merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets
(other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the
funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or was merged, consolidated
or otherwise combined with or into the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or
in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date, which encumbrance or restriction is not
applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person and its Subsidiaries, or
the property or assets of the Person and its Subsidiaries, so acquired; provided that, for the purposes of this
clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer (as defined under “—Merger and
_Consolidation”), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall_
be deemed acquired or assumed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such
Person becomes the Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument that extends, renews, refinances or
replaces any of the encumbrances or restrictions referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this
clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an
agreement referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the
encumbrances and restrictions with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken
as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to
which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:


-----

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that
is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or
other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or
restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or
other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capital Lease Obligations
permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on
the property so acquired in the nature of clause (c) of the preceding paragraph, or any encumbrance or restriction
pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the assets or
Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets) imposed
pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or
substantially all the Capital Stock or property or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets
that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and instruments
entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or
order, or required by any regulatory authority or any governmental licenses, concessions, franchises or permits,
including restrictions or encumbrances on cash or deposits (including assets in escrow accounts) paid on
property;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers, suppliers or

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any Indebtedness
permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” if (A) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or
instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes than
(i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
together with the security documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in
effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors or an Officer of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) or (B) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
determines at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or restrictions will not
adversely affect, in any material respect, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest
payments on the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantors’ ability
to comply with their respective obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Note
Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(12) restrictions created in connection with a Qualified Securitization Financing, CIR Financing or Receivables

ordinary course of business (including agreements entered into in connection with a Restricted Investment),
which limitation is applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such agreements; provided that the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer determines at the time of the Incurrence of such encumbrances that such encumbrances or
restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to make
principal or interest payments on the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and Subsidiary
Guarantors’ ability to comply with their respective obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior
Secured Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents; or

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any
Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset
Disposition is not less than the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined in good faith by an Officer or
the Board of Directors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in
respect of such Asset Disposition consists of:

180 days of such Asset Disposition, of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of
such Asset Disposition);

next balance sheet) (other than Subordinated Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary remains obligated in respect of such liabilities or
(y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released

Secured Notes Issuer or the applicable Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and (ii) is not Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor;

(f) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash

Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value); or

(g) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (a) through (f) of this clause (2).

If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net
Available Cash of the Asset Disposition, within 450 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset


-----

Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1)(a) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof; provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of
term Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to such clause (1)(a), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary will retire term Indebtedness and will cause any related commitment to be permanently reduced in an
amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchased or redeemed; (ii) unless included in the
preceding clause (1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the
Collateral on a senior or pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes and that is not Public Debt at a price of
no more than the principal amount of such applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Additional
Amounts and applicable prepayment or redemption premium, if any, to the date of such prepayment, repayment,
purchase or redemption, (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the
Collateral on a senior or pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes and that is Public Debt at a price of no
more than the principal amount of such applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Additional
Amounts and applicable prepayment or redemption premium, if any, to the date of such prepayment, repayment,
purchase or redemption, provided that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem
pursuant to clause (iii) only if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this
covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase their Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth
below for an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes equal to the
proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding bears to (y) the
total aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount
outstanding of such Indebtedness (other than the Senior Secured Notes); or (iv) prepay, repay, purchase or
redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or any
Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other than
Subordinated Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or
Indebtedness owed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(2) purchase the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of Senior Secured Notes at a purchase
price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) or by making an Asset
Disposition Offer to all Holders of the Senior Secured Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out below)
or redeem the Senior Secured Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if, after giving
effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a Similar
Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1), (3), (4), (5) or (6) of
this paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted
application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on
which such investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned
450-day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date, provided, however, if the assets
disposed of constitute Collateral or constitute all or substantially all of the assets of a Restricted Subsidiary
whose Capital Stock has been pledged as Collateral (in each case, other than assets that only constitute part of
the Collateral because such assets are subject to a floating charge or equivalent Lien), the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer shall pledge or shall cause the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to pledge any Capital Stock or assets (to
the extent such assets were of a category of assets included in the Collateral as of the Issue Date) acquired with
the Net Available Cash from such disposition referred to in this covenant in favor of the Senior Secured Notes
on a first-priority basis, subject to the Agreed Security Principles.


-----

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in the previous paragraph constitutes “Excess
**Proceeds”** provided that, if at the time of any Definitive Agreement, put option or similar arrangement in respect of any
Asset Disposition or (at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) the date on which Net Available Cash from an
Asset Disposition is received, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries is no greater than 5.0 to 1.0, 50% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition shall be deemed
not to constitute Excess Proceeds and may be used by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries for any purpose not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Pending the final application of any
such Net Available Cash, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or
otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may elect to apply Net Available Cash in
accordance with clauses (1) through (8) above prior to receiving such Net Available Cash; provided that such application
is made no earlier than the execution of a Definitive Agreement in respect of the applicable Asset Disposition. On the
451st day after an Asset Disposition or such earlier time if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects, if the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of €97 million and 2.43% of Total Assets, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer will be required to make within 30 Business Days thereof an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders
and, to the extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness that
is secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes, to purchase, prepay or redeem
the maximum principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset
Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more
than) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Additional Amounts and applicable prepayment or
redemption premium, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum
denominations €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable).

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition
Offer by Holders and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the
amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Secured Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered
Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness
not denominated in Euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro
Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer
Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset
at zero. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make an Asset Disposition
Offer prior to the expiration of the 450-day period mentioned above.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the Senior Secured Notes are denominated, the amount
thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are
denominated that is actually received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net
Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a period of
not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five
Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari
Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or,
if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase
Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent
necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of
Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset
Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in
minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable). The Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Senior Secured Notes or


-----

portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in accordance with the terms of this
covenant. The Paying Agent shall deliver to the Holders of Senior Secured Notes the purchase price of Senior Secured
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn and arrange for the deduction of the appropriate amounts of Senior Secured
Notes from such Holders’ accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable). Any Note not so accepted will be
promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of
the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes
pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations
conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by
virtue of such compliance.

first complete fiscal year of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer following such election shall be deemed timely furnished to

So long as Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, after furnishing to the Trustee the annual report required by
clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will promptly hold a conference call to
discuss such report and the results of operations for the relevant reporting period.

Any person who requests or accesses such financial information or seeks to participate in any conference calls
required by this covenant may be required to provide its email address, employer name and other information reasonably
requested by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and represent to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (to the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s reasonable good faith satisfaction) that:

(1) it is a holder of the Senior Secured Notes, a beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, a bona fide
prospective investor in the Senior Secured Notes, a bona fide market maker in the Senior Secured Notes affiliated with
any Initial Purchaser or a bona fide securities analyst providing an analysis of investment in the Senior Secured Notes;

(2) it will not use the information in violation of applicable securities laws or regulations;

(3) it will keep such provided information confidential and will not communicate the information to any
Person; and

(4) it (a) will not use such information in any manner intended to compete with the business of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries and (b) is not a Person (which includes such Person’s Affiliates) that (i) is
principally engaged in a Similar Business or (ii) derives a significant portion of its revenues from operating or owning a

“affiliates” under the Securities Act.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Senior
Secured Notes copies of all reports furnished to the Trustee on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s website. All financial
statement information shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date of such report or financial

report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. In addition, the
reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

At any time that any of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any

In the event that (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file
the reports required by Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act with the SEC, or (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects to
provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision
of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it
elects, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents
and other reports that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such

business, assets, shareholding or results of operations or financial condition of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and include an unaudited reconciliation of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s financial statements or
other financial information to the Senior Notes Issuer’s financial statements or other financial information, as applicable.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, on an ongoing basis, monitor that the provisions described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation to Holding Company Activities – Senior Notes Issuer” are satisfied by the Senior Notes_
Issuer. Starting with the reporting period in which the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitations to
_Holding Company Activities – Senior Notes Issuer” are no longer satisfied and at any time thereafter, the reports set forth_
in clauses (1), (2), and (3) will include consolidated financial statements and financial information of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer.

Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a
series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is the surviving entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the
“Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any
member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom, any State of the United States of America or the
District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, or Switzerland and the Successor Senior Secured
Notes Issuer (if not the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) will expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture,

Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and, (b) all
obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of

Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing;

Secured Notes Indenture, and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has
been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the
Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any
matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, which
properties and assets, if held by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed
to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.


-----

The Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right
and power of, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all
or substantially all of its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes, as the case may be.

such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries as an entirety or

Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor substantially concurrently with
such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposal;

(b) (1) either (x) a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is the continuing
Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of
the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor under its Senior Secured Note Guarantee and the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee) and all obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as
applicable; and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing; or

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor (in each case other than to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) under the heading “—The Senior Secured Notes_

partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses.

(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor from
consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor; (ii) any consolidation or merger of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer with and into any Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor; provided that if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger on
consolidation, the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The Senior Secured
_Notes Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; or (iii) any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor consolidating into or merging_


-----

or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity,
reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity, provided, however, that
clause (3)(b) under the heading “—The Senior Secured Notes Guarantors” shall apply to any such transaction.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or
substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries may implement a Permitted Reorganization.

**_Limitations to Holding Company Activities – Biogold_**


-----

Biogold may not carry on any business or own any assets, other than:

(1) the Transactions and entering into and exercising its rights and performing its obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security

(4) ownership of cash, Cash Equivalents and Investment Grade Securities; and

(5) activities reasonably incidental to the foregoing, and other activities that are de minimis in nature.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and
continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the
“Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture summarized under the following captions will
not apply to the Senior Secured Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) “—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”;

(7) the provisions of clause (3) under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer”; and

(8) the restrictions under the definition “Unrestricted Subsidiary”.

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will cease to be effective
and will not be applicable to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on
which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to
actions of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary properly taken during the continuance of the
Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The
“Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all
Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the
Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also permit, without causing
a Default or Event of Default, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any
contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have an
Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not
in anticipation of the Senior Secured Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Senior Secured Notes
Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption have been
satisfied; provided that no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this


-----

caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain an
Investment Grade Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Senior Notes Issuer and Biogold will not, and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not cause
or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the
result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the
paragraph below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially
impair the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Senior
Notes Issuer and Biogold will not, and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders
and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Senior Notes Issuer, Biogold and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in
accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (iii) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to
cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency therein; (iv) the Senior Notes Issuer,
Biogold, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may discharge and release Security Interests
with respect to the Collateral in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization, (v) the applicable
Security Documents may be amended in any manner that does not adversely affect the rights of the Security Agent, the
Trustee or the Holders of Senior Secured Notes in any material respects; and (vi) the Security Interests, and the related
Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released
(followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets); provided, however,
that in the case of clause (vi) above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced; unless, contemporaneously with any such action, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Security Agent either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the
Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms
the solvency of the Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of
Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent (subject to customary
exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the
Security Documents, as so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced, are valid
Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, to which such
Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer complies with the
requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security
Agent being indemnified, secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction) consent to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities, any Credit
Facility in excess of €10 million or any other Public Debt, in each case, of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor on the date
on which such Senior Secured Note Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a Senior Secured Note Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be
obligated to become such a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Senior
Secured Note Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles.

Future Senior Secured Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under
“—Note Guarantees Release”. A Senior Secured Note Guarantee of a future Senior Secured Notes Guarantor (other than
the Post-Closing Guarantors) may also be released at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer if at the date of such


-----

release there is no Indebtedness of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue
Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture if such Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor had not been designated as a Senior Notes Secured Guarantor. The Trustee and the Security
Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Senior Secured Note Guarantee in
accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified, secured
and/or prefunded to its satisfaction.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in
connection with the Incurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness
permitted pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and (2) any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (1), Biogold, the Senior Notes Issuer, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and, if applicable, the Security Agent
shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor
agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the
existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially
less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Senior Secured
Note Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement
will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security
Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also will provide that, at the written direction of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or
more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or
inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement
that may be Incurred by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such
agreement (including, with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of
provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes), (3) add Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the
Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of
the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any
other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. In formulating its
opinion on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel. The Senior Secured
Notes Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor
Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers”, and the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such
amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee
or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the
Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of
Subordinated Indebtedness; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured Note,
shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions
described herein), and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.


-----

**Listing**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will use its reasonable efforts to (i) obtain the listing of the Senior Secured
Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for permission to be granted to deal in the Senior Secured Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange as promptly as practicable after the Issue Date and (ii) maintain such listing and admission
to trading for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is unable to obtain
such listing, or if maintenance of such listing becomes unduly onerous, it will, prior to the delisting of the Senior Secured
Notes from the Official List of the Exchange, use its reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such Notes on
another “recognised stock exchange” as defined in section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom.

**Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Transactions**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, in each
case in connection with any acquisition, disposition, merger, Joint Venture, investment or other similar transaction where
there is a time difference between commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of Incurrence of
Indebtedness, Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of
any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, be the date the Definitive
Agreement for such acquisition, disposition, merger, Joint Venture, investment or similar transaction are entered into
and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such acquisition, disposition,
merger, Joint Venture, investment or similar transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection
therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning
of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such transaction (and not
for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio). For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets
or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated
EBITDA of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or
prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as
a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transactions are permitted hereunder and (y)
such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or related transactions;
_provided, further, that if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry_
into such Definitive Agreement, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date of such Definitive Agreement and be outstanding thereafter for
purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture after the date of such agreement
and before the consummation of such transactions.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note issued under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required
repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor to comply with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(4) failure by Biogold, the Senior Notes Issuer, Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply
for 60 days after written notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30%
in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes with its other agreements contained in the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be
secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary), other than Indebtedness owed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:


-----

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the
expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
**provision”),**

and in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other
such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates the greater of €77 million and 1.93% of Total Assets or more;

(6) other than on a solvent basis, certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of Biogold, the Senor
Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer),
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer),
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of
€77 million and 1.93% of Total Assets (exclusive of any amounts for which a solvent insurance company has
acknowledged liability), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the
judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(8) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other
than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) with respect to Collateral having a
fair market value in excess of the greater of €19 million and 0.48% of Total Assets for any reason other than the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the release of any such security
interest in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder
shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall
assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and any such Default continues for
10 days (the “security default provision”);

(9) any Senior Secured Note Guarantee of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full
force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Senior Secured Note Guarantee or the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding and any such Default
continues for 30 days, or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations
under its Senior Secured Note Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days (the “guarantee
**provision”); and**

(10) any of the following events or circumstances occurs: (i) any change to the terms and conditions of the Golden
Share or the by-laws of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer affecting the financial rights attached to the Golden
Share or (ii) any redemption, cancellation, repurchase, transfer or assignment of the Golden Share (other than
any transfer to the Security Agent as a result of enforcement of the Collateral) or (iii) failure by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with clause (iv) of the proviso of clause (26) of the
definition of Asset Disposition or clause (ii) of the proviso included in the definition of Sequenced Acquisition
Permitted Payment.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing,
the Trustee, by notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, by written notice to the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to be
due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and
payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of
Default described in clause (5) under the definition of Events of Default has occurred and is continuing, the declaration
of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default
triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the
Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within
30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior


-----

Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing
Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Senior Secured Notes that became due
solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be immediately due and payable
without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may
not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive any past or existing Defaults or
Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, the
waiver of which shall require the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes affected) and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and its
consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event
of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to
the Trustee indemnity or security and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense.
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested the Trustee
to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security, indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee against
any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of
such security, indemnity and/or prefunding; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given the
Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to
the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will
provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise
of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee,
however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or that the
Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to
indemnification, prefunding and/or other security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and
expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have
no obligation to monitor compliance by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The
Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is given notice in
writing of such occurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders
within 60 days after being so notified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment
of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so
long as the Trustee determines in good faith that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal
year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that
occurred during the previous year. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days


-----

after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults,
their status and what action the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods
prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate
pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery
prior to acceleration in respect of the relevant breach of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate,
as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in
certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified, secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction. It may not be
possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such
circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be
for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be
waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior
Secured Notes); provided that, if any amendment, supplement, other modification or waiver will only amend, supplement
or waive one series of the Senior Secured Notes, only the consent of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such series shall be required. However, without the consent of Holders holding not
less than 90% (or, in the case of clauses (7) and (9) of this paragraph, 80%) of the then outstanding principal amount of
the Senior Secured Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a
non-consenting Holder or, if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend, supplement, modify or
waive one series of the Senior Secured Notes, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case
of clauses (7) and (9) of this paragraph, 80%) of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of such series of Senior
Secured Notes affected, with respect to any such series of Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Senior Secured Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior Secured Note or change the time at which any
Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Senior Secured Note payable in a currency other than that stated in the Senior Secured Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder of any outstanding Senior Secured Note to bring suit for the enforcement of any
payment of principal of, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on or with respect to such Holder’s Senior
Secured Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(7) release all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the


-----

Senior Secured Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured
Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release all or substantially all of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors from their obligations under the Senior
Secured Note Guarantees or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in this
sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee,
the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Secured Notes
Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary under any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(3) to add to the covenants or provide for a Senior Secured Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or
surrender any right or power conferred upon Biogold, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) to make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee, the Security Agent or the
Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights of or benefits to the Trustee, the Security Agent or any of the
Holders in any material respect under the Senior Secured Notes Documents;

(5) to make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Senior Secured Note Guarantee in accordance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Additional Guarantees”, to add Senior Secured Note Guarantees with respect to the Senior_
Secured Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, or to confirm and evidence the
release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Senior Secured Note Guarantee or Lien (including the
Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the
Senior Secured Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior Secured Notes
to any provision of this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” to the extent that such provision in this
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior Secured Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor trustee or security agent
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the trustee or security agent to any Senior
Secured Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor of
the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior Facilities Agreement, in any property
which is required by the Security Documents or the Senior Facilities Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date)
to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the
Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any
Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”;


-----

(11) to provide for or facilitate the issuance of uncertificated Senior Secured Notes in addition to or in place of
certificated Senior Secured Notes; provided that the uncertificated Senior Secured Notes are issued in registered
form for the purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Senior Secured
Notes are not treated as “registration-required obligations” under Section 163(f)(2)(A) of the Code;

(12) to comply with the rules of any applicable depositary; or

(13) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the transfer and
legending of Senior Secured Notes as permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including to facilitate
the issuance and administration of the Senior Secured Notes or, if Incurred in compliance with the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, Additional Senior Secured Notes; provided that compliance with the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture as so amended would not result in Senior Secured Notes being transferred in violation of the
Securities Act or any applicable securities laws and regulations and such amendment does not materially and
adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Senior Secured Notes.

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely on such evidence as
it deems necessary, without further inquiry, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel. The consent of the
Holders is not necessary under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of any Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by any Holder
of Senior Secured Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered
invalid by such tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment authorized
by clause (3) above to add a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, it shall only be
necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantor
to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, (ii) such additional Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture need only be
duly authorized and executed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Trustee.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes have
concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Secured Notes owned by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or by
any Person directly or indirectly controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding; provided that, for the purpose of determining
whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Senior Secured Notes
which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.

**Defeasance**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
(“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including
those respecting the defeasance trust (as defined below), the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of
the Trustee and the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registration of Senior Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior
Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust.
Subject to the foregoing, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents
and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer at any time may terminate its, the Senior Notes Issuer’s and the Restricted
Subsidiaries’ obligations under the covenants described under “Certain Covenants” (other than clause (1) and (2) under
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer”) and “Change of Control” and
the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the
cross-default upon a Payment Default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to any
Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision
described under “—Events of Default” (“covenant defeasance”).


-----

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option
notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer exercises its legal
defeasance option, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with
respect to such Senior Secured Notes. If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clause (1) of the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer”), (4), (5), (6) (with respect only to the_
Significant Subsidiaries or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, when taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), (7),
(8) or (9) under “—Events of Default”.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust
(the “defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this
purpose) cash in Euro or Euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient for
the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity, as the
case may be, provided that, if requested by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee will distribute any amounts
deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be, and must comply
with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders and beneficial owners of the relevant
Senior Secured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and
in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling
received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer from, or published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change
in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer with the intent
of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions and qualifications), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with; and

(4) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either
defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be
of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Senior Secured Notes, as
expressly provided for in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) as to all outstanding Senior Secured Notes when (1) either
(a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior
Secured Notes, and certain Senior Secured Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter
the funds have been released to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for
cancellation; or (b) all Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called
for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of
redemption by the Paying Agent in its name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee
for this purpose), money or Euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as
applicable in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Senior Secured Notes not
previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of
deposit (in the case of Senior Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption
date, as the case may be; (3) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture; (4) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the
Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Senior
Secured Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be (subject to the succeeding sentences), and
(5) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel


-----

(provided that such counsel may not be an employee of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries) each to the
effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have been complied with; provided that
any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the
foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)). The Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or
appointed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, acting for the Trustee for this
purpose) shall distribute any amounts deposited pursuant to this paragraph to the Holders on the date specified in writing
(in the above referenced notice of redemption or Officer’s Certificate or otherwise) by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer at
least two Business Days prior to the specified date of distribution, which date of distribution may in the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s discretion be prior to the Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be. For the avoidance of
doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the redemption date as set forth above will not include any
negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Senior
Secured Notes are represented by a Senior Secured Global Note deposited with a depositary for a clearing system, any
payment to the beneficial holders holding Senior Secured Book-Entry Interests as participants of such clearing system
will be subject to the then applicable procedures of the clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all
such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver
may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a
waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform
only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. During the existence of an Event of
Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the
Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not be construed
as an obligation or duty.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it
become a creditor of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on
certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Security Agent and any other agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions
with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed
and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written
notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest
that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six
months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee. Any removal or
resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,
liability, Taxes or expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Notices**

Notices, warnings, summonses and other communications to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes from the
Trustee shall be sent via Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) with a copy to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Any
such notice or communication shall be deemed to be given or made when sent from Euroclear or Clearstream (as


-----

applicable). The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s written notifications to the holders of Senior Secured Notes shall be sent
through Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable), with a copy to the Trustee and the Exchange (to the extent required by
the rules of the Exchange).

**Prescription**

Claims against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors for the payment of
principal, or premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for
payment thereof. Claims against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors for the
payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of
interest.

**Currency Indemnity**

The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes is Euro. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than Euro, (whether as a
result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the holder (or, if applicable, the Trustee) in respect of any
sum expressed to be due to it from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will constitute a discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer only to the extent of the Euro amount, which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or
recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on
that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount, expressed to
be due to the recipient under any Senior Secured Note, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will indemnify the recipient
against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any event the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will indemnify the recipient
against the cost of making any such purchase.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
Euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent for purposes hereof that is denominated in a currency other
than Euro shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-Euro amount is
Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Certain Information Reporting Provisions**

**_Mutual Undertaking Regarding Information Reporting and Collection Obligations_**

Each Party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (a “Party”) shall, within ten business days of a written request
by another Party, supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information relating to it, its operations,
or the Senior Secured Notes as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other Party’s compliance with
Applicable Law and shall notify the relevant other Party reasonably promptly in the event that it becomes aware that any
of the forms, documentation or other information provided by such Party is (or becomes) inaccurate in any material
respect; provided, however, that no Party shall be required to provide any forms, documentation or other information
pursuant to this paragraph to the extent that: (i) any such form, documentation or other information (or the information
required to be provided on such form or documentation) is not reasonably available to such Party and cannot be obtained
by such Party using reasonable efforts; or (ii) doing so would or might in the reasonable opinion of such Party constitute
a breach of any: (a) Applicable Law; (b) fiduciary duty; or (c) duty of confidentiality. For purposes of this paragraph,
“Applicable Law” shall be deemed to include (i) any rule or practice of any competent regulatory, prosecuting, Tax or
governmental authority by (“Authority”) which any Party is bound or with which it is accustomed to comply; (ii) any
agreement between any Authorities; and (iii) any agreement between any Authority and any Party that is customarily
entered into by institutions of a similar nature.

**_Notice of Possible Withholding Under FATCA_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall notify the Paying Agent in the event that it determines that any payment
to be made by the Paying Agent under the Senior Secured Notes is a payment which could be subject to any withholding
or deduction required pursuant to an agreement described in section 1471(b) of the Code, or otherwise imposed pursuant
to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any regulations or agreements thereunder, any official interpretations thereof,
or any law implementing an intergovernmental approach thereto (“FATCA Withholding”) if such payment were made
to a recipient that is generally unable to receive payments free from FATCA Withholding, and the extent to which the
relevant payment is so treated, provided, however, that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligation under this paragraph


-----

shall apply only to the extent that such payments are so treated by virtue of characteristics of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes, or both.

**_Paying Agent Right to Withhold_**

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Paying Agent shall be entitled
to make a deduction or withholding from any payment which it makes under the Senior Secured Notes for or on account
of any Taxes, if and only to the extent so required by Applicable Law, in which event the Paying Agent shall make such
payment after such deduction or withholding has been made and shall account to the relevant Authority within the time
allowed for the amount so deducted or withheld or, at its option, shall reasonably promptly after making such payment
return to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer the amount so deducted or withheld, in which case, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer shall so account to the relevant Authority for such amount. For the avoidance of doubt, FATCA Withholding is a
deduction or withholding which is deemed to be required by Applicable Law for the purposes of this paragraph.

**_Issuer Right to Redirect_**

In the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer determines in its sole discretion that any deduction or
withholding for or on account of any Taxes will be required by Applicable Law in connection with any payment due to
any of the agents on any Senior Secured Notes, then the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be entitled to redirect or
reorganize any such payment in any way that it sees fit in order that the payment may be made without such deduction or
withholding provided that, any such redirected or reorganized payment is made through a recognised institution of
international standing and otherwise made in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Senior Secured
Notes Issuer will promptly notify the agents and the Trustee of any such redirection or reorganization. For the avoidance
of doubt, FATCA Withholding is a deduction or withholding which is deemed to be required by Applicable Law for the
purposes of this paragraph.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors
are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest,
Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Secured Notes,
may not be collectable within the United States. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—The
_Senior Secured Note Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral may be limited by applicable laws or_
_subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations”._

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors will
in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough
of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

“Consolidated Net Leverage” means the sum of the aggregate outstanding Indebtedness of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries that is Incurred under the first and second paragraphs of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” (excluding clauses (6), (8), (9), (10), (16) and
(17) of the second paragraph thereof) less cash and Cash Equivalents of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, as of the relevant date of calculation on a consolidated basis on the basis of GAAP. In
determining the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, no cash or Cash Equivalents shall be included in the calculation of
Consolidated Net Leverage to the extent that such cash or Cash Equivalents are the proceeds of Indebtedness Incurred on
the date of determination in respect of which the calculation of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is to be made.

“Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio” means, as of any date of determination, the ratio of (x) (i) Consolidated
Net Leverage at such date plus (ii) the Reserved Indebtedness Amount in respect of Indebtedness which, once incurred,
would be included in the calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage to (y) the aggregate amount of Consolidated EBITDA
for the period of the four most recent fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of such determination for which internal
consolidated financial statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer are available. In the event that the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurs, assumes, guarantees, repays, repurchases, redeems, defeases or
otherwise discharges any Indebtedness (other than Incurrences or repayments of ordinary working capital borrowings)
subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on
or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is made (the
“Calculation Date”), then the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio will be calculated giving pro forma effect (as
determined by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) (including in respect of
anticipated cost savings and expense and cost reduction and expense and cost synergies reasonably anticipated to be
taken within 24 months) to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or
other discharge of Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of
the applicable reference period; provided, however, that (except with respect to calculations made pursuant to clause (17)


-----

of the third paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) the pro forma calculation shall
not give effect to (i) any Indebtedness Incurred on the Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions described in the
second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” (other than clause (5)(ii) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or (ii) the discharge on
the Calculation Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to
the provisions described in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”.

In addition, for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio:

(1) acquisitions or Investments (each, a “Purchase”) that have been made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary, including through mergers or consolidations, or by any Person or any Restricted
Subsidiary acquired by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries which are Restricted
Subsidiaries, and including all related financing transactions and including increases in ownership of Restricted
Subsidiaries, during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to
the Calculation Date, or that are to be made on the Calculation Date, will be given pro forma effect (as
determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer),
including in respect of anticipated cost savings and expense and cost reduction and expense and cost synergies
reasonably anticipated to be taken within 24 months, as if they had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter
reference period; provided that, if a Definitive Agreement has been entered into with respect to a Purchase that
is part of the transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will
be calculated after giving pro forma effect to such Purchase (including anticipated cost savings and expense and
cost reduction and expense and cost synergies reasonably anticipated to be taken within 24 months) as if such
Purchase had occurred on the first day of such period, even if the Purchase has not yet been consummated as of
the date of determination;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued operations, as determined
in accordance with GAAP, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating
unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma
basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period (taking into account anticipated cost savings
resulting from any such disposal, as determined by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer);

(3) the Fixed Charges attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and
operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and ownership interests
therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition
occurred on the first day of such period, but only to the extent that the obligations giving rise to such Fixed
Charges will not be obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary following the
Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a Restricted
Subsidiary at all times during such four-quarter period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such four-quarter period; and

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be calculated
as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into
account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness), and if any Indebtedness is not
denominated in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for purposes of the
calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage shall be treated in accordance with GAAP.

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio,
Consolidated EBITDA, Fixed Charges and Consolidated Net Income, (a) calculations will be as determined in good faith
by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (including in respect of anticipated
expense and cost reductions and expense and cost synergies as though the full effect of such expense and cost reductions
and expense and cost synergies were realized on the first day of the relevant period and shall also include the reasonably
anticipated full run rate cost savings effect (as calculated in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) of cost savings programs, business optimization programs or other restructurings or
reorganizations that have been initiated by a member of the Group as though programs, restructurings or reorganizations
had been fully implemented on the first day of the relevant period (regardless of whether these cost savings and expense


-----

and cost reduction and expense and cost synergies could then be reflected in pro forma financial statements to the extent
prepared); provided that such anticipated expense and cost reductions and expense and cost synergies and cost savings
are reasonably anticipated to be taken within 24 months after the consummation of the cost savings program, business
optimization program, restructuring, reorganizations or any operational change or the Purchase or sale which is expected
to result in such anticipated expense and cost reductions and synergies and cost savings), and (b) in determining the
amount of Indebtedness outstanding on any date of determination and Fixed Charges for the relevant period, pro forma
effect shall be given to any Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase, defeasance or other discharge of
Indebtedness as if such transaction had occurred on the first day of the relevant period.

_less cash and Cash Equivalents of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, as of the relevant date_
of calculation on a consolidated basis on the basis of GAAP; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation of
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio shall not give effect to (i) any Indebtedness Incurred on the relevant
date of calculation pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” (other than clause 5(ii) of the second paragraph of the covenant_
described under—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or (ii) the discharge on the relevant date of
calculation of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to the
provisions described in the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”. In determining the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, no cash or Cash Equivalents shall be_
included in the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage to the extent that such cash or Cash Equivalents
are the proceeds of Indebtedness Incurred on the date of determination in respect of which the calculation of the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is to be made.

“Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio” means, as of any date of determination, the ratio of (x) (i)
the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage at such date plus (ii) the Reserved Indebtedness Amount in respect of
Senior Secured Indebtedness which, once incurred, would be included in the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured
Net Leverage to (y) the aggregate amount of Consolidated EBITDA for the period of the four most recent fiscal quarters
ending prior to the date of such determination for which internal consolidated financial statements of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer are available, in each case calculated with such pro forma and other adjustments as are consistent with the

Indebtedness is not denominated in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for
purposes of the calculation of Fixed Charges shall be treated in accordance with GAAP; and

Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

The Senior Notes Issuer will issue €250 million aggregate principal amount of      % Senior Notes due 2029
(the “Initial Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes will be issued under an indenture to be dated as of       , 2021 (the

Holding, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Elavon Financial Services DAC, as paying agent (the

DAC, as registrar (the “Registrar”) and Elavon Financial Services DAC, as security agent (the “Security Agent”), in a
private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The Senior Notes
Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

entirety. We urge you to read the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor

Notes Indenture, the forms of Senior Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set
forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Listing and General Information”.

The Senior Notes Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional

relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for
undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and
guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent.

the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act
and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary”,
we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. Any future Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Notes Indenture and will not guarantee

      - be represented by one or more registered notes in global registered form, but in certain circumstances may
be represented by the relevant Senior Definitive Registered Notes (see “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”).

**The Senior Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

The Senior Notes will be guaranteed:

      - on the Issue Date by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, LBM Bioesterel, BPO-Bioépine, Bio Lam LCD,
Unilians and Biomer (collectively, the “Initial Guarantors”); and

      - within 60 days following the Issue Date by Medisch Labo Medina BV, Macsys NV, Centrum voor
Medische Analyse BV, Dyomedea-Neolab, Laborizon Maine Anjou, Biosynergie, Laborizon Centre,
Laborizon Bretagne and Astralab (collectively, the “Post-Closing Guarantors”),

each of which will be an obligor under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities within the same timeframes as
described above. In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Additional Guarantees,” subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other_
Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Senior Note Guarantee in the future. The Senior Note Guarantees will be joint and
several obligations of the Senior Notes Guarantors.

The Senior Note Guarantee of each Senior Notes Guarantor will:

      - be a general senior subordinated obligation of that Senior Notes Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—
_Security”;_

      - be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior Indebtedness of that Senior Notes
Guarantor, including any Indebtedness Incurred under (or Guarantees of) the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, Senior Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations;

      - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Pari Passu Indebtedness of that Senior
Notes Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Senior Note Guarantee;

      - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Senior Notes Guarantor that
is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Senior Note Guarantee;

      - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Senior Notes
Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Senior Note Guarantee, to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation; and

      - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such Senior Notes
Guarantor that are not Senior Notes Guarantors, including obligations owed to trade creditors.

The obligations of a Senior Notes Guarantor under its Senior Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to
prevent the relevant Senior Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value
or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin capitalization”
rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things,
might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Senior Notes
Guarantor. Additionally, the Senior Note Guarantees will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied
with. The Senior Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply to
and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Notes, the Senior Facilities
and the Senior Secured Notes where, among other things, any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other


-----

legal limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the cost of such grant is disproportionate to the benefit to the
creditors, including the Holders, of obtaining the applicable guarantee. By virtue of these limitations, a Senior Notes
Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to
the Senior Notes, or a Senior Notes Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Senior Note Guarantee.

As of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Senior Notes Guarantors in aggregate represented
approximately 78.7% of the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) and 86.3% of our
pro forma total assets (including goodwill).

Claims of creditors of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Senior Notes Guarantors, including trade creditors and
creditors holding debt and Guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if
any) of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Senior Notes Guarantors generally will have priority with respect to the assets
and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes
Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes and each Senior Note Guarantee therefore will be
structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders of Restricted Subsidiaries that
are not Senior Notes Guarantors (if any). Although the Senior Notes Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant
exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Notes Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted
Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior
Notes Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”.

**_Senior Note Guarantees Release_**

The Senior Note Guarantee of a Senior Notes Guarantor will terminate and release:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the
relevant Senior Notes Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company of such Senior Notes
Guarantor), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes
Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other disposition;

(2) upon the sale or disposition (including by way of consolidation, amalgamation, combination or merger) of all or
substantially all the assets of the Senior Notes Guarantor (other than to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Senior Notes Indenture;

(3) upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture of the Senior Notes Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—
_Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(5) upon the unconditional release of the Senior Notes Guarantor’s Guarantee under any Indebtedness that triggered
such Senior Notes Guarantor’s obligation to guarantee the Senior Notes under the covenant described in “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”;_

(6) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
relating to the release of a Senior Note Guarantee upon an enforcement sale or other disposal of such Senior
Notes Guarantor;

(7) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(8) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization; or

(9) with respect to an entity that is not the successor Senior Notes Guarantor, as a result of a transaction permitted
by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”.

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions reasonably requested in writing by the
Senior Notes Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Senior Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions,
subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the


-----

Trustee and the Security Agent without the consent of or liability to the Holders or any other action or consent on the part
of the Trustee or the Security Agent.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes Issuer will issue €250 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior
Notes. The Senior Notes will mature on      , 2029. The Senior Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Interest on the Senior Notes will accrue at the rate of        % per annum and will:

      - accrue from (and including) the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from (and including) the
interest payment date it was most recently paid;

      - be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on        and        , commencing on        , 2021;

      - be payable to the holder of record of the Senior Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the
related interest payment date;

      - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months; and

      - be calculated on the nominal amount of the Senior Notes.

Interest on overdue principal, interest, premium or Additional Amounts will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher
than the rate of interest otherwise applicable to the Senior Notes.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such
payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding
Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Additional Senior Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Senior Notes Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, the Senior Notes_
Issuer is permitted to issue additional Senior Notes of the same or different series, which shall have terms substantially
identical to the Senior Notes except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate supplied to the Trustee (“Additional Senior **Notes”):**

(1) the title of such Additional Senior Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Senior Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Senior Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Senior Notes shall bear interest and,
if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates, the date
or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be payable
or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of holders thereof
to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Senior Notes shall be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Senior Notes may be
payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and conditions
upon which, such Additional Senior Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such Additional Senior Notes shall be issued and redeemed;


-----

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional
Senior Notes; and

(9) any relevant limitation language with respect to Senior Note Guarantees and Security Documents.

All series of Additional Senior Notes will be treated, along with all other Senior Notes, as a single class for the
purposes of the Senior Notes Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not
specifically distinguished for any applicable series; provided, that if the Additional Senior Notes are not fungible with the
Senior Notes originally issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Additional Senior Notes will be issued with a
separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number, as applicable, from the Senior Notes
originally issued. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Senior Notes Indenture and this
“Description of the Senior Notes”, references to “Senior **Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Senior**
Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Senior Notes. Additional Senior Notes may be
designated to be of the same series as the Senior Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms
substantially identical in all material respects to the Senior Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, and shall be deemed
to form one series therewith, and references to the Senior Notes shall be deemed to include the Senior Notes initially
issued on the Issue Date as well as any such Additional Senior Notes.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Notes**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Global Notes (as defined below)
will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by
the registered Holder thereof (being the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Senior
**Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents. In**
addition, interest on the Senior Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer, by bank
transfer to the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Senior Notes for the Senior Definitive
Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Notes” below.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Notes**

The Senior Notes Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Notes (including the initial
Paying Agent). The initial Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC (the “Paying Agent”).The Senior Notes
Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar
will be Elavon Financial Services DAC and the initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC . The
Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Senior Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and
together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Senior Notes on behalf of the Senior Notes Issuer. A
register of the Senior Notes shall also be maintained at the registered office of the Senior Notes Issuer. In case of
inconsistency between the register of the Senior Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Senior Notes Issuer
at its registered office, the register kept by the Registrar shall prevail.

The Senior Notes Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Senior Notes
without prior notice to the Holders of the Senior Notes. However, for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the
Official List of the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Senior Notes Issuer will notify the Exchange
of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act
as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons,
as follows:

   - each series of Senior Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Senior **144A Global Notes”). The Senior 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue**
Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream; and

   - each series of Senior Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will


-----

initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Senior **Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Senior 144A Global Notes, the “Senior Global**
**Notes”). The Senior Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the**
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.
Ownership of interests in the Senior Global Notes (“Senior Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons
that have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants

Ownership of Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors”. In addition, transfers
of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear
and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by
Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of Senior Book-Entry Interests in the Senior Regulation S Global Notes (the
“Senior Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of
a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made
in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Subject to the foregoing, Senior Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of Senior 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification
(in the form provided in the Senior Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the
transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice
_to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction._

Any Senior Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Senior Book-Entry Interest in the Senior Global Note from which it was transferred and will
become a Senior Book-Entry Interest in the Senior Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after
such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Senior
Book-Entry Interests in the Senior Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Senior Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Transfer Agent and the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Senior Notes
Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Senior Book-Entry Interests. Senior Definitive Registered Notes
issued in exchange for a Senior Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture or as otherwise
determined by the Senior Notes Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with
respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors”.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Notes issued as Senior Definitive Registered
Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Senior Notes Indenture will
require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate,
to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such
transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such
transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any
Senior Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the applicable Senior Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of the applicable Senior Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or


-----

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer
or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to
treat the registered Holder of a Senior Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Senior Notes will be secured by first priority security interests over (i) share capital and other securities of
the Senior Notes Issuer held respectively by Biogroup Holding and Biogold 2, (ii) intercompany receivables owed to
Biogroup Holding by the Senior Notes Issuer and Biogold 2 and (iii) share capital and other securities of Biogold 2 held
by Biogroup Holding.

The Collateral will also secure the liabilities of any Additional Senior Notes and may also secure certain future
Indebtedness, in each case on a pari passu basis with the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees. Any proceeds
received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied pro rata in repayment of all obligations under
the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes and any other Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred and secured on a
_pari passu basis with the Senior Notes and Senior Note Guarantees pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture and the_
Intercreditor Agreement. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the
obligations owed to the Holders of the Senior Notes. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with
this issuance of Senior Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Liens”, certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be_
limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles as described under “Description of
_Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement”._

For further information regarding limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally
available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting
the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law, see “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the Trustee, the Security Agent
and the Holders of the Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture and (b) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness
permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents, which provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Senior Notes are secured by first
priority Security Interests over the Collateral. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”, “—Release of Liens”, “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens”._

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors have granted, or will
grant, security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due and payable of the Senior Notes Issuer’s and the
Senior Notes Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Senior Notes, the Senior Note Guarantees and the Senior Notes
Indenture. The Security Documents have been, or will be, entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security
Agent as agent for the secured parties or under the parallel debt as the case may be. When entering into the Security
Documents, the Security Agent has acted in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the
Trustee and the Holders of Senior Notes from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will
also act as a security agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities, the trustee and the holders of Senior Secured Notes
and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations.


-----

The Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that, to the extent permitted by the
applicable laws, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee
and the Holders of the Senior Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders of the Senior Notes will
not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Notes, except through the
Trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture) provide
instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the enforcement of the Collateral. The Senior Notes Indenture and
Security Documents will permit the Trustee to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action under the Security
Documents (following the occurrence of an event of default under such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness being declared
due and payable and the Trustee having received, where required, the requisite approval or consent of the holders of such
Indebtedness). See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”.

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees, as applicable, will be secured by Security
Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior Notes, the Senior Note Guarantees and the Senior Notes
Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes
Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens”.

Subject to the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors will have the right to
remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Senior Notes, to freely operate the
property and assets constituting Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom (including any and
all dividends, distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments in respect of Capital Stock of the Senior Notes
Guarantors that is part of the Collateral).

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in
certain circumstances may be restricted by arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the
Collateral in compliance with the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”._

The Security Agent will be appointed under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement to act as agent for the
Holders of the Senior Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness,
including the Security Documents. The Trustee has authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise
the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security
documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute
each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the
Security Agent on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound; Subordination of the Note_**
**_Guarantees on the basis of the Intercreditor Agreement_**

To establish the relative rights of certain creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors
under certain financing arrangements, including the Senior Notes, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities, the
Trustee will enter into the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the obligations
of the Senior Note Guarantees will be subordinated to the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Facilities, including any Guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Facilities, and will be subject to, among
other things, certain standstills on enforcement and turnover obligations. Each of the Senior Note Guarantees is a senior
subordinated obligation of the relevant Senior Notes Guarantor, which means that, pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, each such Senior Note Guarantee ranks behind, and is expressly subordinated to, obligations
owed by the relevant Senior Notes Guarantor under its guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes (or in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes), the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior
Facilities Agreement and any other indebtedness permitted to be Incurred on a senior basis to the Senior Notes. Upon the
occurrence of certain circumstances, the Senior Note Guarantees of the Senior Notes Guarantors may be released and
discharged without the consent of holders of the Senior Notes in connection with a distressed disposals and foreclosures
under the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Notes Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Senior Notes, by accepting such Note, will
be deemed to have:


-----

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements
and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security
Documents.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements”._

**_Release of Liens_**

The Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to release the Security Interests in
respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to a Person that is not the Senior Notes Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary, if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;_

(2) upon a release of the Lien (the “Initial Lien”) that resulted in the creation of the Lien (the “Notes Lien”) under
the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” so long as
immediately after the release of the Notes Lien there is no other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the property
and assets that were the subject of the Initial Lien and Notes Lien that would result in the requirement for the
Senior Notes to be secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, such Lien;

(3) in the case of a Senior Notes Guarantor that is released from its Senior Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of
the Senior Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Senior Notes
Guarantor;

(4) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(5) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—
_Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(6) if the Senior Notes Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital
Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(7) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization;

(8) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include Collateral, or the sale or
transfer of such property or assets, which may include Collateral, in each case pursuant to a Qualified
Securitization Financing, CIR Financing or Receivables Facility; or

(9) in connection with any disposal of Collateral to the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that
such release is followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets
in a manner consistent with, and pursuant to applicable formalities under, the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”._

Biogroup Holding and Biogold 2 will be entitled to release the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral
directly owned by it pursuant to the provisions of clauses (4) and (5) above.


-----

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”.

The Security Agent and the Trustee will take all necessary action reasonably requested in writing by the Senior
Notes Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees, in
accordance with the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the relevant Security Document subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the
releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the
part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release).

**Optional Redemption**

On and after         , 2024, the Senior Notes Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Senior
Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice (except as permitted under “—Selection and Notice” below),
at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the
twelve-month period beginning on         of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**

2024 .................................................................................................................................................. %

2025 .................................................................................................................................................. %

2026 and thereafter ........................................................................................................................... 100.000%

Except as described below and except as described under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons” the Senior
Notes are not redeemable until      , 2024.

Prior to      , 2024, the Senior Notes Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem in the aggregate up to
40% of the original principal amount of the Senior Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional
Senior Notes of the same series), upon not less than 10 or more than 60 days’ notice, with funds in an aggregate amount
not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of
principal amount) of        % as of the date of the applicable redemption notice, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 60% of the original principal amount of the Senior Notes (including the original principal amount of any
Additional Senior Notes of the same series) issued under the Senior Notes Indenture remain outstanding after
each such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

Prior to       , 2024, the Senior Notes Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a portion of the Senior
Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice (except as permitted under “—Selection and Notice” below),
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus the Applicable Premium and
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date).

**_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers_**

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, all of the Senior Notes, if holders of not less
than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes validly tender and do not validly
withdraw such Senior Notes in such tender offer and the Senior Notes Issuer, or any third party making such tender offer
in lieu of the Senior Notes Issuer, purchases all of the Senior Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such
holders, then all holders will have been deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer and the Senior Notes


-----

Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice following such purchase
date, to redeem all Senior Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each
other holder in such tender offer (excluding any early tender or incentive fee), plus, to the extent not included in the
tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of
such redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date).

**_General_**

We may repurchase the Senior Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise. Notice
of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice”.

If the Senior Notes Issuer effects an optional redemption of Senior Notes, it will, for so long as Notes are listed
on any securities exchange and the rules of such an exchange so require, inform the exchange of such optional
redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after
such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Senior Note is registered at the close
of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Senior Notes will be subject
to redemption by the Senior Notes Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Senior Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any
such redemption may, at the Senior Notes Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. In addition,
the Senior Notes Issuer may provide in any notice of redemption that payment of the redemption price and the
performance of its obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person; provided, however,
that the Senior Notes Issuer will remain obligated to pay the redemption price and perform its obligations with respect to
such redemption in the event such other Person fails to do so. Notice of any redemption in respect of an Equity Offering
may be given prior to completion thereof.

If the Senior Notes Issuer elects to redeem the Senior Notes or portions thereof and, in connection with a
satisfaction and discharge or defeasance of the Senior Notes Indenture in accordance with the provisions set forth under
“—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge”, requests that the Trustee distribute to the Holders amounts deposited
in trust with the Trustee (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include accrued and unpaid interest to the date fixed for
redemption) prior to the date fixed for redemption, the applicable redemption notice will state that Holders will receive
such amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee (i) on or promptly after the date fixed for redemption or (ii) on such
earlier payment date as selected by the Senior Notes Issuer.

**_Mandatory Redemption_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments
with respect to the Senior Notes.

**_Selection and Notice_**

If less than all of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar
will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis or in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream (as
applicable), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. None of the
Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

For so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Senior
Notes Issuer shall publish notice of redemption in accordance with the prevailing rules of the Exchange and in addition to
such publication, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date (except as permitted below), mail
such notice to Holders of the Senior Notes by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they
appear on the registration books of the Registrar with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. In the case of Global
Notes, such notice of redemption may also be sent in accordance with the rules and procedures of Euroclear or
Clearstream (as applicable). On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on the Senior Notes or the part of
the Senior Notes called for redemption.


-----

If any Senior Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Senior Note shall
state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Senior Definitive Registered Note, a
new Senior Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Senior Definitive
Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Senior Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Senior Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such
Senior Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof.
Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Senior Notes called for redemption become due on the date
fixed for redemption. If such redemption is subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the related
notice may, for the avoidance of doubt, state that, in the Senior Notes Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be
delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived (provided that in no event shall such
date of redemption be delayed to a date later than 60 days after the date on which such notice was sent, except that
redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with
a defeasance of the Senior Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes Indenture), or such redemption may
not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or
waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Senior Notes Issuer may redeem the Senior Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption
(a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due
on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under “—Withholding
_Taxes/Additional Amounts”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the_
redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Senior Notes Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change, or amendment to, the existing official written position or the introduction of an official written
position regarding in the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or
rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in
published practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next
interest payment date in respect of the Senior Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the
Senior Notes (but, in the case of a Senior Notes Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be
made by the Senior Notes Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay such
Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such
Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The
foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party
to the Senior Notes Indenture, with respect to a change or amendment occurring after the time such successor Person
becomes a party to the Senior Notes Indenture.

A notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“—Selection and Notice”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than
90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts if
a payment in respect of the Senior Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to
pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the
Senior Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate
stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that the Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional
Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized
standing and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the
Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee
will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction
of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on
the Holders.


-----

**Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Senior Notes Guarantor (including any
successor entity) (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Senior Notes or with respect to any Senior Note Guarantee, as
applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless
the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of,
any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Note or any Senior Note Guarantee is made
by or on behalf of the Payor or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the
power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or
otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax

(each of clauses (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required by law to be made
from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any Senior Note or any Senior Note Guarantee, as
applicable, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together
with such payments) such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of
such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such additional
amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Senior Note
or Senior Note Guarantee, as applicable, in the absence of such withholding or deduction (the “Additional Amounts”);
_provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner of a Senior Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the
relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but for the avoidance of doubt not limited to,
being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or
maintaining a permanent establishment in or being physically present in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but
excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership, holding or sale of such
Senior Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Note, the
Senior Notes Indenture, a Senior Note Guarantee, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or a Security Document;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner
of the Senior Note to comply with a reasonable written request by the Payor addressed to the Holder, after
reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be made), to provide
certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence, or identity of the
Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting
requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice
of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction of,
all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such
certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Senior Note for payment
(where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for
payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had
the Senior Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment under or with respect to
the Senior Notes or any Senior Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, use, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment
or other governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to such Senior Note or Senior Note Guarantee to any Holder who is a
fiduciary or a partnership (including any entity that is treated as a partnership for applicable tax purposes) or any


-----

person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with
respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership (or entity treated as a partnership for applicable tax
purposes) or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary,
settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Note directly;

(7) any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, (the “Code”), as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version of such sections that
are substantively comparable), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any official interpretations thereof, any
intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the
foregoing and any law, regulation, or official interpretation thereof implementing such intergovernmental
agreement, or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies
of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld to each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such
payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon
reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the relevant Paying Agent.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any
payment made on any Senior Note or any Senior Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the
Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the
amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional
Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises or the Payor
becomes aware less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s
Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate
as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes or this “Description of the Senior Notes” there is
mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a redemption of Senior Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Notes or any Senior Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any
other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect
thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (and in the case of enforcement, any jurisdiction) from the execution,
delivery, registration, issuance, or enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to, the Senior Notes, any Senior
Note Guarantee, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation
thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Senior Notes after the initial resales by the Initial
Purchasers pursuant to this Offering and limited, solely in the case of Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments
with respect thereto, to any such Taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1)
through (3) and (5) through (7) above or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Notes Indenture
and any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is organized or incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax
purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment with respect to the Senior Notes (or any Senior Note


-----

Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or
therein having the power to tax.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “Change of
_Control”, each Holder will have the right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to_
€100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, if applicable; provided that Senior Notes of €100,000 or less,
as the case may be, may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Senior Notes at a purchase price in
cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Senior
Notes Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase Senior Notes as described under this heading, “Change of Control”, in
the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Senior Notes and given
notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been
satisfied or waived.

Unless the Senior Notes Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Notes and given
notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been
satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Senior Notes Issuer will mail a
notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of the Senior Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the
Senior Notes Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount of such Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to
receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such
notice is mailed (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Senior Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue
interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any
Senior Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the
Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Senior Notes Issuer, consistent with the Senior Notes Indenture,
that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer
is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Senior Notes Issuer
will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Notes
so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of
Senior Notes or portions of the Senior Notes being purchased by the Senior Notes Issuer in the Change of
Control Offer.

A Holder willing to tender Senior Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of its
election, who shall in turn notify the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once such tender has been
accepted by the Senior Notes Issuer and notified to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall promptly credit the bank


-----

account of such Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Notes so tendered and deduct the corresponding
amount of such Senior Notes from such Holder’s Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) account.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Notes Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Notes in the
event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase
Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Senior
Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Senior Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Senior Notes
Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a
Change of Control and conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a Definitive Agreement is in
place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Senior Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Notes pursuant to
this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior
Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue
of such compliance.

The Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer
may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would
require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness at the option of each lender under the Senior Facilities.

In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities may not constitute
a Change of Control under the Senior Notes Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries
may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to
be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Senior
Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness,
even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Senior Notes Issuer.
Finally, the Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Senior
Notes Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases.

The definition of Change of Control includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other
Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise
established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there
may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially
all” of the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear
as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Senior Notes Issuer to make an
offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of
Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Senior Notes Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may
Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if, on the date of such Incurrence, after giving pro forma effect to
the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0.


-----

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (“Permitted
**Debt”):**

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary under any Credit Facility
(including in respect of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder) in an
aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the sum of:

(a) (i) €1,500 million plus (ii) the greater of €386 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA (provided
that any amount of Permitted Debt Incurred by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
pursuant to this subclause (a)(ii) shall only be available under any revolving facility (including under
the Revolving Credit Facility and any increase in commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility);
plus

(b) an amount equal to the greater of €386 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA; plus

(c) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion
thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, accrued and unpaid interest, underwriting discounts, premiums
(including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such
refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Senior Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred
by another provision of this covenant; provided that, if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to the
Senior Notes or a Senior Note Guarantee, then the Guarantee must be subordinated to the Senior Notes or such
Senior Note Guarantee to the same extent as the Indebtedness being guaranteed; or (b) without limiting the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens”, Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or
applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long
as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided,
however, that:

(a) if the Senior Notes Issuer or a Senior Notes Guarantor is the obligor on any such Indebtedness and the
obligee is a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Senior Notes Guarantor, such Indebtedness is unsecured
and ((i) except in respect of intercompany current liabilities Incurred in connection with the cash
pooling and other cash management operations of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, (ii) to the extent legally permitted (the Senior Notes
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures required in the reasonable
judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to protect such Persons from any penalty or
civil or criminal liability in connection with the subordination of such Indebtedness) and (iii) if the
aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness that is outstanding for a
period of less than 60 days) of the Senior Notes Issuer or such Senior Notes Guarantor owed to a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Senior Notes Guarantor exceeds the greater of €20 million and
0.50% of Total Assets) expressly subordinated pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any

(b) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such
Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary and any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Senior

second paragraph of this covenant shall not exceed the greater of €193 million and 4.83% of Total Assets at any time
outstanding.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the
first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Senior Notes Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and
may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type
of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) notwithstanding clause (1) above, all Indebtedness outstanding under (i) the Term Loan Facility on the Issue
Date and (ii) the Revolving Credit Facility at any time (and, in the case of both (i) and (ii), any refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof) shall be deemed Incurred under clause (1)(a) of the second paragraph of this
covenant and may not be reclassified;

(3) with respect to clauses (1) through (18) (other than clauses (1)(a) and (5)) of the second paragraph of this
covenant, if at any time that the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to have
Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, such item of
Indebtedness shall (unless otherwise elected by the Senior Notes Issuer) be automatically reclassified into an
item of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant;

(4) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular
amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (13) or (15) of
the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption
or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(7) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting
such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other
provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(8) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” or “Total Assets” in relation to the second paragraph
of this covenant, Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets, as the case may be, shall be measured at the option of
the Senior Notes Issuer on the most recent date on which new commitments are obtained or the date on which
new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case of revolving facilities) or the date on which new Indebtedness is
Incurred (in the case of term facilities) and, in the case of Consolidated EBITDA, for the period of the most


-----

recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to such date for which such internal consolidated financial
statements of the Senior Notes Issuer are available;

(9) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance
Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by
reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets (as applicable) at the time of Incurrence, if
such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets (as applicable)
restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets on the
date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets (as applicable) restriction, as
the case may be, shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums
(including tender premiums), defeasance costs and fees in connection with such refinancing;

(10) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the
amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP;

(11) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit
Facility or other revolving credit line, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a “cash sweep” or
“clean down” provision or any provisions that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically
shall only be deemed for the purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was
first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof; and

(12) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such Indebtedness,
such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and
expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs
and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the
form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations
not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for
purposes of this covenant. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value
thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation
preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be
Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, the Senior Notes Issuer
shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Euro
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in
the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro Equivalent), in the
case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Euro, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of
Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the
Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any
such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the
Euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in Euro will
be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

In the event that the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur any Lien
pursuant to clause (28) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under
the Indenture, including for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage
Ratio, as applicable, or usage of clauses (1) through (18) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above for


-----

borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) will, at the Senior Notes Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined (i) on the date of such
revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof (or, at the
option of the Senior Notes Issuer, a portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness (in each
case, pursuant to any letter, agreement or instrument, which may be conditional, including as to documentation) and/or
(ii) on the date on which such facility or commitments become available, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Senior Notes Indenture is satisfied with
respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit
and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Senior Notes Indenture at the time
of any borrowing or re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the
committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness
**Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as**
applicable, and, to the extent of the usage of clauses (1) through (18) above shall be deemed to be Incurred and
outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility
or increased commitment, and in each case, the Senior Notes Issuer may revoke such determination at any time and from
time to time.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Senior
Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as
a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance
other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based
on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is
in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Neither the Senior Notes Issuer nor any Senior Notes Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including
Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Senior Notes
Issuer or any Senior Notes Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to
the Senior Notes and the applicable Senior Note Guarantee, if any, on substantially identical terms; provided, however,
that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the
Senior Notes Issuer or any Senior Notes Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with
different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or
other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or in respect of the Senior Notes Issuer’s or any
Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation

(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer (other than Disqualified
Stock) or in Subordinated Shareholder Funding; and

measured by value);

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer or any

defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”);

(4) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem,
defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Funding (other than any payment
of interest or premium thereon in the form of additional Subordinated Shareholder Funding); or

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person,

(each such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition,
retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (5) is referred to herein as a “Restricted
**Payment”), if at the time the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:**

(a) a Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately thereafter therefrom);

(b) the Senior Notes Issuer is not able to Incur an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” after giving effect, on a pro forma basis, to such
Restricted Payment; or

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made subsequent to the
Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted Payments permitted below by clauses (5) or (10)
of the third paragraph of this covenant, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the third
paragraph of this covenant) would exceed the sum of (without duplication):

(i) 50% of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting period) from the first day of
the fiscal quarter commencing immediately prior to the Issue Date to the end of the most recent fiscal

deficit, minus 100% of such deficit);

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined in accordance with
the next paragraph) of property or assets or marketable securities, received by the Senior Notes Issuer

Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded
by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary subsequent to the Issue Date of any Indebtedness that has been converted into or exchanged
for Capital Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference
Shares) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding (plus the amount of any cash, and the fair market value
of property or assets or marketable securities received by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted

(iv) (a) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined in accordance
with the next paragraph) of property or assets or marketable securities, received by the Senior Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the disposition of any Unrestricted Subsidiary or the


-----

disposition or repayment of any Investment constituting a Restricted Payment made after the Issue
Date (other than to the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or an employee stock ownership
plan or trust established by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer for the
benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary)

in an entity that subsequently becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, 100% of the fair market value of such
Investments as of the date such entity becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or (c) upon the full and
unconditional release of a Restricted Investment that is a Senior Note Guarantee made by the Senior
Notes Issuer or one of the Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person after the Issue Date, an amount equal
to the amount of such Senior Note Guarantee;

(v) in the event that an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or all of the assets
of such Unrestricted Subsidiary are transferred to the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
the Unrestricted Subsidiary is merged or consolidated into the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, 100% of the amount received in cash and the fair market value (as determined in
accordance with the next paragraph) of any property or assets or marketable securities received by the

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for purposes of the preceding_
clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Senior Notes Issuer’s option) included in any of the foregoing clause (iv),
(v) or (vi); provided further that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded
**Amounts”) that would otherwise be included in the calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments**
pursuant to the preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts result from the receipt of
Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities received in contemplation of, or in connection
with, an event that would otherwise constitute a Change of Control pursuant to the definition thereof, (2) the
purpose of, or the effect of, the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities
was to reduce the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio so that there would be an occurrence of a Specified Change
of Control Event that would not have been achieved without the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds or property
or assets or marketable securities and (3) no Change of Control Offer is made in connection with such Change
of Control in accordance with the requirements of the Senior Notes Indenture.

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence shall be the fair
market value thereof as determined by an Officer of the Senior Notes Issuer or the Board of Directors of the Senior Notes
Issuer in good faith.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be
determined conclusively by the Board of Directors of the Senior Notes Issuer.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or portion
thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Restricted Payments described in clauses (1) through (22)
above, or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the clauses in the definition
of “Permitted Investment”, the Senior Notes Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be entitled to divide or classify such
Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date made or later divide or reclassify such Restricted
Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant (including as a Permitted
Investment).

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits
therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property
or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted
Liens if the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture (or a Senior Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of Senior
Notes Guarantors) are directly secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles (but without regard to any Agreed
Security Principles limiting the types of assets that may be pledged to secure the Senior Notes and the Senior Note
Guarantees under the Senior Notes Indenture), equally and ratably with, or senior in priority to, in the case of Liens with
respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is
so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Holders of Senior Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding
paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the
Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens”.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness.


-----

The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection
with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of
interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation
preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate
of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness need
not be permitted solely by reference to one category of Permitted Liens described in the definition of “Permitted Liens”
or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant but may be permitted in part under any combination thereof and (B) in
the event that a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of the
categories of Permitted Liens described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, the Senior Notes Issuer shall, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify,
such Lien securing each item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant
and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Lien or such item of Indebtedness secured by such Lien
in one of the clauses of the definition of “Permitted Liens” and such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness will be
treated as being incurred or existing pursuant to only one of such clauses or pursuant to the first paragraph hereof.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any Indebtedness
or other obligations owed to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) make any loans or advances to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(c) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application
of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other
Indebtedness Incurred by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, shall not be deemed to
constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities) and any other
agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date, (b) the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Security Documents or any related security
documents or (c) any other agreement or instrument with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in each case, in effect on the Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any Capital
Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was acquired by or
merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Senior
Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or
Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate,
the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or
was acquired by the Senior Notes Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the
Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and
outstanding on such date, which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or
assets of any Person, other than the Person and its Subsidiaries, or the property or assets of the Person and its
Subsidiaries, so acquired; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the Successor
Senior Notes Issuer (as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or
instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Senior Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Senior Notes Issuer;


-----

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument that extends, renews, refinances or
replaces any of the encumbrances or restrictions referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this
clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an
agreement referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the
encumbrances and restrictions with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary contained in
any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole
than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such
refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors or an Officer of the Senior Notes Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that
is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or
other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the Senior
Notes Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the
transfer of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or other security
agreements; or

reciprocal easement agreements of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capital Lease Obligations
permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the
property so acquired in the nature of clause (c) of the preceding paragraph, or any encumbrance or restriction
pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the assets or
Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets) imposed
pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or
substantially all the Capital Stock or property or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets
that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and instruments
entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or
order, or required by any regulatory authority or any governmental licenses, concessions, franchises or permits,
including restrictions or encumbrances on cash or deposits (including assets in escrow accounts) paid on
property;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers, suppliers or

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any Indebtedness
permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” if (A) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or
instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Senior Notes than (i) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the
Senior Notes Indenture, together with the security documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor
Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Senior Notes Issuer) or (B) the Senior
Notes Issuer determines at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or
restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to make principal


-----

or interest payments on the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Issuer and Senior Notes Guarantors’ ability to
comply with their respective obligations under the Senior Notes, the Senior Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(12) restrictions created in connection with a Qualified Securitization Financing, CIR Financing or Receivables
Facility that, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or a responsible accounting or financial
officer of the Senior Notes Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified Securitization Financing,

Notes Issuer determines at the time of the Incurrence of such encumbrances that such encumbrances or
restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to make principal
or interest payments on the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Issuer and Senior Notes Guarantors’ ability to
comply with their respective obligations under the Senior Notes, the Senior Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents; or

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition is
not less than the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined in good faith by an Officer or the Board of
Directors of the Senior Notes Issuer); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of
such Asset Disposition consists of:

(a) cash or Cash Equivalents (including any cash or Cash Equivalents received from the conversion, within
180 days of such Asset Disposition, of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of
such Asset Disposition);

(b) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary recorded on the Senior Notes Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if
Incurred since the date of the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet)
(other than Subordinated Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Senior Notes Issuer nor any
Restricted Subsidiary remains obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the Senior
Notes Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of such
Indebtedness as a result of such Asset Disposition;

(c) Replacement Assets;

(d) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the second paragraph of this
covenant;

(e) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Senior Notes Guarantor
received from Persons who are not the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the
extent that such Indebtedness (i) has been extinguished by the Senior Notes Issuer or the applicable
Senior Notes Guarantor and (ii) is not Subordinated Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or such
Senior Notes Guarantor;


-----

(f) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any one time outstanding, not to exceed the
greater of €58 million and 1.45% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of each issue of
Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value); or

(g) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (a) through (f) of this clause (2).

If the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available
Cash of the Asset Disposition, within 450 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition
and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any (i) Senior Debt, (ii) Pari Passu Indebtedness or any refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof; provided that in the case of this clause (ii) only (A) in connection with any such
prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of term Indebtedness, the Senior Notes Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary will retire such term Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) to be
permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchased or redeemed and
(B) the Senior Notes Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to
purchase their Senior Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer for
an aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Notes outstanding bears to (y) the total aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes
outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (other than
the Senior Notes); or (iii) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Senior Notes Guarantor or any
Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other than
Subordinated Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Senior Notes Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the
Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(2) purchase the Senior Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) or by making an Asset Disposition Offer to all
Holders of the Senior Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out below) or redeem the Senior Notes as
described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if, after giving
effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a Similar
Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1), (3), (4), (5) or (6) of
this paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted
application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on
which such investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned
450-day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date, provided, however, if the assets
disposed of constitute Collateral or constitute all or substantially all of the assets of a Restricted Subsidiary
whose Capital Stock has been pledged as Collateral (in each case, other than assets that only constitute part of
the Collateral because such assets are subject to a floating charge or equivalent Lien), the Senior Notes Issuer
shall pledge or shall cause the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to pledge any Capital Stock or assets (to the
extent such assets were of a category of assets included in the Collateral as of the Issue Date) acquired with the
Net Available Cash from such disposition referred to in this covenant in favor of the Senior Notes on a
first-priority basis, subject to the Agreed Security Principles.


-----

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in the previous paragraph constitutes “Excess
**Proceeds”** provided that, if at the time of any Definitive Agreement, put option or similar arrangement in respect of any
Asset Disposition or (at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer) the date on which Net Available Cash from an Asset
Disposition is received, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is
no greater than 5.0 to 1.0, 50% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition shall be deemed not to constitute
Excess Proceeds and may be used by the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for any purpose not
prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture. Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Senior Notes
Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner
that is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture. The Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may
elect to apply Net Available Cash in accordance with clauses (1) through (8) above prior to receiving such Net Available
Cash; provided that such application is made no earlier than the execution of a Definitive Agreement in respect of the
applicable Asset Disposition. On the 451st day after an Asset Disposition or such earlier time if the Senior Notes Issuer
elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of €97 million and 2.43% of Total Assets, the
Senior Notes Issuer will be required to make within 30 Business Days thereof an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to
all Holders and, to the extent the Senior Notes Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness,
to purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of Senior Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to
which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect
of the Senior Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more
than) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes and 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Additional Amounts and applicable prepayment or
redemption premium, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Senior Notes Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum
denominations €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable).

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Senior Notes
Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture. If the
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and such other
Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the
Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased
on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness.
For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in Euro, such
Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a
date selected by the Senior Notes Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. The Senior Notes Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make an Asset Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the 450day period mentioned above.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Notes is denominated in a
currency other than the currency in which the Senior Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of
such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually
received by the Senior Notes Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Senior Notes, will remain open for a period of not less
than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business
Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Senior
Notes Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Senior Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness
required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the
Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly
tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Senior Notes
Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount of Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable). The Senior Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
stating that such Senior Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Senior Notes Issuer in accordance
with the terms of this covenant. The Paying Agent shall deliver to the Holders of Senior Notes the purchase price of
Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn and arrange for the deduction of the appropriate amounts of Senior


-----

Notes from such Holders’ accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable). Any Note not so accepted will be
promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Senior Notes Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Senior Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Notes pursuant to
the Senior Notes Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions
of this covenant, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations under the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Senior Notes Issuer (any such transaction or series of
related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of €19 million
and 0.48% of Total Assets unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Senior Notes

Following an Initial Public Offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity and/or the listing of such Capital
Stock on a recognized European, United Kingdom or United States stock exchange, the requirements of clause (1),
(2) and (3) above shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of
such stock exchange; provided that (x) the IPO Entity shall provide financial statements consistent with the requirements
of clause (2)(i)above for the first three quarterly periods in each fiscal year after the Issue Date pursuant to clause (2) and
(y) to the extent such IPO Entity relies on such stock exchange reporting requirements to fulfill the requirements of
clauses (1), (2) and (3) above, a reasonably detailed description of such material differences between the financial
statements of such IPO Entity and the financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer shall be included for any period
after the Issue Date.

In the event that the Senior Issuer elects to adopt IFRS in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Notes
Indenture, the annual report required by clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant in respect of the first complete
fiscal year of the Senior Notes Issuer following such election shall be deemed timely furnished to the Trustee if such
report is so furnished within 150 days following the end of such fiscal year.

So long as Senior Notes are outstanding, after furnishing to the Trustee the annual report required by clause (1)
of the first paragraph of this covenant, the Senior Notes Issuer will promptly hold a conference call to discuss such report
and the results of operations for the relevant reporting period.

Any person who requests or accesses such financial information or seeks to participate in any conference calls
required by this covenant may be required to provide its email address, employer name and other information reasonably
requested by the Senior Notes Issuer and represent to the Senior Notes Issuer (to the Senior Notes Issuer’s reasonable
good faith satisfaction) that:

(1) it is a holder of the Senior Notes, a beneficial owner of the Senior Notes, a bona fide prospective
investor in the Senior Notes, a bona fide market maker in the Senior Notes affiliated with any Initial Purchaser or a bona
fide securities analyst providing an analysis of investment in the Senior Notes;

(2) it will not use the information in violation of applicable securities laws or regulations;


-----

(3) it will keep such provided information confidential and will not communicate the information to any
Person; and

(4) it (a) will not use such information in any manner intended to compete with the business of the Senior
Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries and (b) is not a Person (which includes such Person’s Affiliates) that (i) is principally
engaged in a Similar Business or (ii) derives a significant portion of its revenues from operating or owning a Similar
Business.

In addition, the Senior Notes Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of
such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as
the Senior Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the
Securities Act.

The Senior Notes Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Senior Notes copies
of all reports furnished to the Trustee on the Senior Notes Issuer’s website. All financial statement information shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the
basis of GAAP as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be
described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the
event of a change in GAAP, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include
separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer. In addition, the reports set forth above will
not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

At any time that any of the Senior Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of
the Senior Notes Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this
“Reports” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the
footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Senior
Notes Issuer.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Senior Notes Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports
required by Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act with the SEC, or (ii) the Senior Notes Issuer elects to provide to the
Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Senior Notes Issuer) the
reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the
Senior Notes Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that
the Senior Notes Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon
complying with the foregoing requirement, the Senior Notes Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions
contained in the preceding paragraphs.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Senior Notes Issuer_

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign,
convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Senior Notes
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Senior Notes Issuer is the surviving entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the
“Successor Senior Notes Issuer”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state
of the European Union, the United Kingdom, any State of the United States of America or the District of
Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, or Switzerland and the Successor Senior Notes Issuer (if not the
Senior Notes Issuer) will expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee,
in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior
Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture and, (b) all obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;


-----

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of
the Successor Senior Notes Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Senior Notes Issuer as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Senior Notes Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Senior Notes Issuer or the Successor Senior
Notes Issuer would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the
most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available immediately preceding
the date on which the transaction is consummated would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving
effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Senior Notes Issuer or the Successor Senior Notes Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such
supplemental indenture (if any is required in connection with such transaction) comply with the Senior Notes
Indenture, and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor
Senior Notes Issuer (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in
giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer, which properties and
assets, if held by the Senior Notes Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Senior Notes Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Senior Notes Issuer.

The Successor Senior Notes Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of
its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Senior Notes Indenture or the
Senior Notes, as the case may be.

_The Senior Notes Guarantors_

No Senior Notes Guarantor (other than a Senior Notes Guarantor whose Senior Note Guarantee is to be released
in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Senior Notes Guarantor is the surviving
corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of
such Senior Notes Guarantor and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it,

unless:

(a) the other Person is the Senior Notes Issuer, or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Senior Notes
Guarantor or becomes a Senior Notes Guarantor substantially concurrently with such consolidation,
merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposal;

(b) (1) either (x) a Senior Notes Guarantor or the Senior Notes Issuer is the continuing Person or (y) the
resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Senior Notes
Guarantor under its Senior Note Guarantee and the Senior Notes Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental
indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and all obligations of
the Senior Notes Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents, as applicable; and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction,
no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or


-----

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a
Senior Notes Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a Senior
Notes Guarantor (in each case other than to the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary)
otherwise permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture;

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) under the heading “—The Senior Notes Guarantors”_
above shall not apply to the extent that compliance with clauses (a) and (b)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any
breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin
capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or
analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the
case of a Senior Notes Guarantor that is a partnership) shareholders of such Senior Notes Guarantor (or, in the case of a
Senior Notes Guarantor that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any
cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):
(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Senior Notes Issuer or a Senior Notes Guarantor from consolidating with,
merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Senior Notes Issuer, a
Senior Notes Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Senior Notes Guarantor; (ii) any consolidation or
merger of the Senior Notes Issuer with and into any Senior Notes Guarantor; provided that if the Senior Notes Issuer is
not the surviving entity of such merger on consolidation, the relevant Senior Notes Guarantor will assume the obligations
of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The
_Senior Notes Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; or (iii) any Senior Notes Guarantor consolidating into or merging or_
combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity,
reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity, provided, however, that
clause (3)(b) under the heading “—The Senior Notes Guarantors” shall apply to any such transaction.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or
substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
may implement a Permitted Reorganization.

**_Limitations to Holding Company Activities – Biogold 2_**

Biogold 2 may not carry on any business or own any assets, other than:

(1) the Transactions and entering into and exercising its rights and performing its obligations under the Senior
Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, in each case to the extent not
prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture and Senior Notes Indenture;

(2) the ownership of the Golden Share;

(3) holding credit balances in bank accounts and any other assets or property Biogold 2 owns on the Issue Date; and
to sell, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all of the foregoing, provided that Biogold 2 shall not
cease to own legally and beneficially and control, in each case, the Golden Share;

(4) ownership of cash, Cash Equivalents and Investment Grade Securities; and

(5) activities reasonably incidental to the foregoing, and other activities that are de minimis in nature.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and continuing
until such time, if any, at which the Senior Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the
provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Senior Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;


-----

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) “—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”;

(7) the provisions of clause (3) under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer”; and

(8) the restrictions under the definition “Unrestricted Subsidiary”.

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Senior Notes Indenture will cease to be effective and will
not be applicable to the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on
which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to
actions of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension
Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The “Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Senior Notes Indenture_
but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the
continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as
permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”.
In addition, the Senior Notes Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Senior Notes
Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any
date on which the Senior Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were
entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Senior Notes no longer having an Investment
Grade Status. The Senior Notes Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing that the conditions set forth in the first
paragraph under this caption have been satisfied; provided that no such notification shall be a condition for the
suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Senior Notes
will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

Biogroup Holding and Biogold 2 will not, and the Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially
impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the paragraph below, that the
Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security
Interests with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and Biogroup Holding and Biogold
2 will not, and the Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any
Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described
in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest
whatsoever in any of the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Biogroup Holding, Biogold 2 and the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with
the Senior Notes Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; (iii) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any
ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency therein; (iv) Biogroup Holding, Biogold 2, the
Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may discharge and release Security Interests with respect to the
Collateral in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization, (v) the applicable Security Documents
may be amended in any manner that does not adversely affect the rights of the Security Agent, the Trustee or the Holders
of Senior Notes in any material respects; and (vi) the Security Interests, and the related Security Documents may be
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate
retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets); provided, however, that in the case of clause (vi)
above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise
modified or replaced; unless, contemporaneously with any such action, the Senior Notes Issuer delivers to the Trustee
and the Security Agent either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from


-----

an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Security
Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee and the Security Agent (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect
to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, as so amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, released, modified or replaced, are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or
new hardening period, in equity or at law, to which such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject immediately prior to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event that the
Senior Notes Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to
each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified, secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction) consent to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement without the need for
instructions from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities, any Credit
Facility in excess of €10 million or any other Public Debt, in each case, of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Senior Notes
Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Senior Notes Guarantor on the date on which such Senior
Note Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form
attached to the Senior Notes Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Senior Note
Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Senior Notes
Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Senior Note Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed
Security Principles.

Future Senior Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Note
_Guarantees Release”. A Senior Note Guarantee of a future Senior Notes Guarantor (other than the Post-Closing_
Guarantors) may also be released at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer if at the date of such release there is no
Indebtedness of such Senior Notes Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not
have been Incurred in compliance with the Senior Notes Indenture if such Senior Notes Guarantor had not been
designated as a Senior Notes Secured Guarantor. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary
actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Senior Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of
the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified, secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Senior Notes Issuer, in connection with the
Incurrence by the Senior Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of
Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (1), Biogold 2, Biogroup Holding, the Senior Notes Issuer and the
relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and, if applicable, the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of
such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor
**Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially**
the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including
containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Senior Note Guarantees and priority and release of the
Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the
Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights,
duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Notes Indenture also will provide that, at the written direction of the Senior Notes Issuer and without
the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to
any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any
such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred
by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including, with respect to
any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new


-----

Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Notes), (3) add Senior Notes Guarantors to the Intercreditor
Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior Notes (including Additional Senior
Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Notes,
(6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not
adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel. The Senior Notes Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under
“—Amendments and Waivers”, and the Senior Notes Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter
into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities under the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Notes Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the
payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of Subordinated
Indebtedness; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments” and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement._

The Senior Notes Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Note, shall be deemed to
have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to
have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Listing**

The Senior Notes Issuer will use its reasonable efforts to (i) obtain the listing of the Senior Notes on the Official
List of the Exchange and for permission to be granted to deal in the Senior Notes on the Official List of the Exchange as
promptly as practicable after the Issue Date and (ii) maintain such listing and admission to trading for so long as such
Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Senior Notes Issuer is unable to obtain such listing, or if maintenance of such
listing becomes unduly onerous, it will, prior to the delisting of the Senior Notes from the Official List of the Exchange,
use its reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such Notes on another “recognised stock exchange” as
defined in section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom.

**Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Transactions**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Senior Notes Indenture, in each case in
connection with any acquisition, disposition, merger, Joint Venture, investment or other similar transaction where there is
a time difference between commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of Incurrence of Indebtedness,
Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or
Event of Default shall, at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer, be the date the Definitive Agreement for such
acquisition, disposition, merger, Joint Venture, investment or similar transaction are entered into and such baskets or
ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such acquisition, disposition, merger, Joint Venture,
investment or similar transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any
Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable
reference period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any
subsequent availability of any basket or ratio). For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are
exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the
Senior Notes Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation
of the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such
fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transactions are permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or
ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or related transactions; provided, further, that if
the Senior Notes Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such Definitive Agreement, any
such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have
occurred on the date of such Definitive Agreement and be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets
or ratios under the Senior Notes Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such
transactions.


-----

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Senior Notes Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Note issued under the Senior Notes Indenture when due and
payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Note issued under the
Senior Notes Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase,
upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Senior Notes Guarantor to comply with the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(4) failure by Biogold 2, Biogroup Holding, the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for
60 days after written notice to the Senior Notes Issuer by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Notes with its other agreements contained in the Senior Notes Indenture, the
Senior Notes, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be
secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary),
other than Indebtedness owed to the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness
or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the
expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
**provision”),**

and in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other
such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates the greater of €77 million and 1.93% of Total Assets or more;

(6) other than on a solvent basis, certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of Biogold 2,
Biogroup Holding, the Senior Notes Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Senior Notes Issuer), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Senior Notes Issuer), would constitute
a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of €77 million and 1.93% of
Total Assets (exclusive of any amounts for which a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability),
which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the
“judgment default provision”);

(8) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other
than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture) with respect to Collateral having a fair
market value in excess of the greater of €19 million and 0.48% of Total Assets for any reason other than the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Senior Notes Indenture or the release of any such security interest
in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be
declared invalid or unenforceable or the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing
that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and any such Default continues for 10 days (the
“security default provision”);

(9) any Senior Note Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of such Senior Note Guarantee or the Senior Notes Indenture) or is declared invalid


-----

or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding and any such Default continues for 30 days, or any Senior Notes
Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Senior Note Guarantee and any such Default
continues for 10 days (the “guarantee provision”); and

(10) any of the following events or circumstances occurs: (i) any change to the terms and conditions of the Golden
Share or the by-laws of the Senior Notes Issuer affecting the financial rights attached to the Golden Share or (ii)
any redemption, cancellation, repurchase, transfer or assignment of the Golden Share (other than any transfer to
the Security Agent as a result of enforcement of the Collateral) or (iii) failure by the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to comply with clause (iv) of the proviso of clause (26) of the definition of Asset
Disposition or clause (ii) of the proviso included in the definition of Sequenced Acquisition Permitted Payment.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing,
the Trustee, by notice to the Senior Notes Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding
Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture, by written notice to the Senior Notes Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the
Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on
all the Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal,
premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of
acceleration of the Senior Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under the definition of Events of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Notes shall be automatically
annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be
remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of
Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if
(1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the
Senior Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders of the Senior Notes may not enforce the Senior
Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes except as provided in the Senior Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Security
Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture
by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive any past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except
with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, the waiver of which shall
require the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes
affected) and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Senior Notes and its consequences if rescission would not
conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
Senior Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity or security and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to
enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to
the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have requested the Trustee to
pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security, indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee against
any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of
such security, indemnity and/or prefunding; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.


-----

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee
or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the
degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to
follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any
action under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification, prefunding and/or other security
satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such
action. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the
Senior Notes Issuer with the Senior Notes Indenture. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and
is continuing and the Trustee is given notice in writing of such occurrence by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee must
give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being so notified by the Senior Notes Issuer. Except in the
case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Note, the Trustee may
withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines in good faith that withholding notice is in the interests of the
Holders.

The Senior Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during
the previous year. The Senior Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what
action the Senior Notes Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate
in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a
failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any
further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the
covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other
provision of the Senior Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery prior to acceleration in respect of
the relevant breach of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such
delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Notes Indenture.

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified, secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction. It may not be possible
for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee
will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action
directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Notes) and,
subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of
the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Notes); provided that, if any amendment,
supplement, other modification or waiver will only amend, supplement or waive one series of the Senior Notes, only the
consent of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes of such series shall be required.
However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clauses (7) and (9) of this
paragraph, 80%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may
not, with respect to any Senior Notes held by a non-consenting Holder or, if any amendment, waiver or other
modification will only amend, supplement, modify or waive one series of the Senior Notes, without the consent of
Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clauses (7) and (9) of this paragraph, 80%) of the then outstanding
aggregate principal amount of such series of Senior Notes affected, with respect to any such series of Senior Notes held
by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Senior Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Senior Note;


-----

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Senior Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior Note or change the time at which any Senior
Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Senior Note payable in a currency other than that stated in the Senior Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder of any outstanding Senior Note to bring suit for the enforcement of any payment
of principal of, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on or with respect to such Holder’s Senior Notes on or
after the due dates therefor;

(7) release all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Senior Notes Indenture;

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior
Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Senior Notes and a waiver of
the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release all or substantially all of the Senior Notes Guarantors from their obligations under the Senior Note
Guarantees or the Senior Notes Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in this
sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the
Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Notes Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary under any Senior Notes Document;

(3) to add to the covenants or provide for a Senior Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon Biogold 2, Biogroup Holding, the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(4) to make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee, the Security Agent or the
Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights of or benefits to the Trustee, the Security Agent or any of the
Holders in any material respect under the Senior Notes Documents;

(5) to make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the
Senior Notes Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Senior Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Senior Note Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Additional Guarantees”, to add Senior Note Guarantees with respect to the Senior Notes, to add security to or_
for the benefit of the Senior Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of
any Senior Note Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in
respect thereof with respect to or securing the Senior Notes when such release, termination, discharge or
retaking or amendment is provided for under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior Notes to any provision
of this “Description of the Senior Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Senior
_Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Security_
Documents or the Senior Notes;


-----

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Notes Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor trustee or security agent
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the trustee or security agent to any Senior
Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor of
the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders, in any property which is required by the Security Documents
(as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is
required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the
Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by
the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”;

(11) to provide for or facilitate the issuance of uncertificated Senior Notes in addition to or in place of certificated
Senior Notes; provided that the uncertificated Senior Notes are issued in registered form for the purposes of
Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Senior Notes are not treated as
“registration-required obligations” under Section 163(f)(2)(A) of the Code;

(12) to comply with the rules of any applicable depositary; or

(13) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Senior Notes as permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration
of the Senior Notes or, if Incurred in compliance with the Senior Notes Indenture, Additional Senior Notes;
_provided that compliance with the Senior Notes Indenture as so amended would not result in Senior Notes being_
transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities laws and regulations and such
amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Senior Notes.

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely on such evidence as
it deems necessary, without further inquiry, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel. The consent of the
Holders is not necessary under the Senior Notes Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of
any Senior Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A
consent to any amendment or waiver under the Senior Notes Indenture by any Holder of Senior Notes given in
connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment authorized
by clause (3) above to add a Senior Notes Guarantor under the Senior Notes Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the
supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional Senior Notes Guarantor to be duly authorized and
executed by (i) the Senior Notes Issuer, (ii) such additional Senior Notes Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other
amendments permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Senior Notes
Issuer and the Trustee.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Notes owned by the Senior Notes Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Senior Notes Issuer will be disregarded
and deemed not to be outstanding; provided that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in
relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Senior Notes which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so
disregarded.

**Defeasance**

The Senior Notes Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer and each Senior
Notes Guarantor under the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing
Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust (as defined
below), the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Senior
Notes Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Notes, registration of Senior
Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and


-----

money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Senior Notes Issuer exercises its legal
defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the
defeasance trust).

The Senior Notes Issuer at any time may terminate its, the Senior Notes Issuer’s and the Restricted Subsidiaries’
obligations under the covenants described under “Certain Covenants” (other than clause (1) and (2) under “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer”) and “Change of Control” and the default provisions_
relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a
Payment Default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to any Significant
Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under
“—Events of Default” (“covenant defeasance”).

The Senior Notes Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its
prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Senior Notes Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment
of the Senior Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Senior Notes. If the
Senior Notes Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Notes, payment of the Senior
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clause (1)
of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer”), (4), (5),
(6) (with respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, when taken together (as
of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Senior Notes Issuer), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary), (7), (8) or (9) under “—Events of Default”.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Senior Notes Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this
purpose) cash in Euro or Euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient for
the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may
be, provided that, if requested by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee will distribute any amounts deposited in trust to the
Holders prior to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other
conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders and beneficial owners of the relevant
Senior Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such
deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and
in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling
received by the Senior Notes Issuer from, or published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in
applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Senior Notes Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions and qualifications), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with; and

(4) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either
defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Senior Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect
(except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Senior Notes, as expressly provided for in the
Senior Notes Indenture) as to all outstanding Senior Notes when (1) either (a) all the Senior Notes previously
authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Notes, and certain Senior Notes for which
provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Senior Notes Issuer) have
been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent
for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one
year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for


-----

the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in its name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Senior Notes
Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by
the Trustee for this purpose), money or Euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof,
as applicable in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Senior Notes not previously
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the
case of Senior Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may
be; (3) the Senior Notes Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Senior Notes Indenture;
(4) the Senior Notes Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture to apply
the deposited money toward the payment of the Senior Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be
(subject to the succeeding sentences), and (5) the Senior Notes Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
and an Opinion of Counsel (provided that such counsel may not be an employee of the Senior Notes Issuer or its
Subsidiaries) each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Senior
Notes Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes Indenture have been complied with;
_provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance_
with the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)). The Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such other entity directed,
designated or appointed by the Senior Notes Issuer and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, acting for the Trustee for
this purpose) shall distribute any amounts deposited pursuant to this paragraph to the Holders on the date specified in
writing (in the above referenced notice of redemption or Officer’s Certificate or otherwise) by the Senior Notes Issuer at
least two Business Days prior to the specified date of distribution, which date of distribution may in the Senior Notes
Issuer’s discretion be prior to the Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt,
the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative
interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Senior Notes are
represented by a Senior Global Note deposited with a depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial
holders holding Senior Book-Entry Interests as participants of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable
procedures of the clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Senior Notes
Guarantor under the Senior Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations
or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release
are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under
the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture. The Senior Notes
Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such
duties as are set forth specifically in the Senior Notes Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee
will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Senior Notes Indenture and use the same degree of care
that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from
taking any action enumerated in the Senior Notes Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Senior Notes Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a
creditor of the Senior Notes Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received
in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar,
the Security Agent and any other agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Senior Notes Issuer and
its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Senior Notes Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and
replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of then outstanding Senior Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the
Senior Notes Issuer, and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated,
or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Senior Notes Issuer may
remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court
for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee. Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not
become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.


-----

The Senior Notes Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability,
Taxes or expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Notes Indenture.

**Notices**

Notices, warnings, summonses and other communications to the holders of the Senior Notes from the Trustee
shall be sent via Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) with a copy to the Senior Notes Issuer. Any such notice or
communication shall be deemed to be given or made when sent from Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable). The
Senior Notes Issuer’s written notifications to the holders of Senior Notes shall be sent through Euroclear or Clearstream
(as applicable), with a copy to the Trustee and the Exchange (to the extent required by the rules of the Exchange).

**Prescription**

Claims against the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors for the payment of principal, or
premium, if any, on the Senior Notes will be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Senior Notes
will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity**

The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Senior Notes Issuer with respect to the
Senior Notes is Euro. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than Euro, (whether as a result of, or the
enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the Senior Notes
Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the holder (or, if applicable, the Trustee) in respect of any sum expressed to be
due to it from the Senior Notes Issuer will constitute a discharge of the Senior Notes Issuer only to the extent of the Euro
amount, which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the
date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is
possible to do so). If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount, expressed to be due to the recipient under any Senior
Note, the Senior Notes Issuer will indemnify the recipient against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any event the
Senior Notes Issuer will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
Euro -denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent for purposes hereof that is denominated in a currency other
than Euro shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-Euro amount is
Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Certain Information Reporting Provisions**

**_Mutual Undertaking Regarding Information Reporting and Collection Obligations_**

Each Party to the Senior Notes Indenture (a “Party”) shall, within ten business days of a written request by
another Party, supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information relating to it, its operations, or
the Senior Notes as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other Party’s compliance with Applicable
Law and shall notify the relevant other Party reasonably promptly in the event that it becomes aware that any of the
forms, documentation or other information provided by such Party is (or becomes) inaccurate in any material respect;
provided, however, that no Party shall be required to provide any forms, documentation or other information pursuant to
this paragraph to the extent that: (i) any such form, documentation or other information (or the information required to be
provided on such form or documentation) is not reasonably available to such Party and cannot be obtained by such Party
using reasonable efforts; or (ii) doing so would or might in the reasonable opinion of such Party constitute a breach of
any: (a) Applicable Law; (b) fiduciary duty; or (c) duty of confidentiality. For purposes of this paragraph, “Applicable
Law” shall be deemed to include (i) any rule or practice of any competent regulatory, prosecuting, Tax or governmental
authority by (“Authority”) which any Party is bound or with which it is accustomed to comply; (ii) any agreement
between any Authorities; and (iii) any agreement between any Authority and any Party that is customarily entered into by
institutions of a similar nature.

**_Notice of Possible Withholding Under FATCA_**

The Senior Notes Issuer shall notify the Paying Agent in the event that it determines that any payment to be
made by the Paying Agent under the Senior Notes is a payment which could be subject to any withholding or deduction


-----

required pursuant to an agreement described in section 1471(b) of the Code, or otherwise imposed pursuant to
sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any regulations or agreements thereunder, any official interpretations thereof, or
any law implementing an intergovernmental approach thereto (“FATCA Withholding”) if such payment were made to a
recipient that is generally unable to receive payments free from FATCA Withholding, and the extent to which the
relevant payment is so treated, provided, however, that the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligation under this paragraph shall
apply only to the extent that such payments are so treated by virtue of characteristics of the Senior Notes Issuer, the
Senior Notes, or both.

**_Paying Agent Right to Withhold_**

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to make a
deduction or withholding from any payment which it makes under the Senior Notes for or on account of any Taxes, if
and only to the extent so required by Applicable Law, in which event the Paying Agent shall make such payment after
such deduction or withholding has been made and shall account to the relevant Authority within the time allowed for the
amount so deducted or withheld or, at its option, shall reasonably promptly after making such payment return to the
Senior Notes Issuer the amount so deducted or withheld, in which case, the Senior Notes Issuer shall so account to the
relevant Authority for such amount. For the avoidance of doubt, FATCA Withholding is a deduction or withholding
which is deemed to be required by Applicable Law for the purposes of this paragraph.

**_Issuer Right to Redirect_**

In the event that the Senior Notes Issuer determines in its sole discretion that any deduction or withholding for
or on account of any Taxes will be required by Applicable Law in connection with any payment due to any of the agents
on any Senior Notes, then the Senior Notes Issuer will be entitled to redirect or reorganize any such payment in any way
that it sees fit in order that the payment may be made without such deduction or withholding provided that, any such
redirected or reorganized payment is made through a recognised institution of international standing and otherwise made
in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture. The Senior Notes Issuer will promptly notify the agents and the Trustee
of any such redirection or reorganization. For the avoidance of doubt, FATCA Withholding is a deduction or withholding
which is deemed to be required by Applicable Law for the purposes of this paragraph.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors are located outside
the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Senior Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes
Guarantors, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any,
and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Notes, may not be collectable within the
United States. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Notes—The Senior Note Guarantees and the security
_interests over the Collateral may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may_
_adversely affect their validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Note_
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Notes Indenture and
the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors will in the Senior Notes Indenture irrevocably
submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County
and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement, will be
governed by the law of England and Wales. The Security Documents are and will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of various jurisdictions.

as calculated by the Senior Notes Issuer or on behalf of the Senior Notes Issuer by such Person as the Senior Notes Issuer

respect of which the calculation of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is to be made.

“Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio” means, as of any date of determination, the ratio of (x) (i) Consolidated
Net Leverage at such date plus (ii) the Reserved Indebtedness Amount in respect of Indebtedness which, once incurred,
would be included in the calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage to (y) the aggregate amount of Consolidated EBITDA
for the period of the four most recent fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of such determination for which internal
consolidated financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer are available. In the event that the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary Incurs, assumes, guarantees, repays, repurchases, redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any
Indebtedness (other than Incurrences or repayments of ordinary working capital borrowings) subsequent to the
commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on or prior to the
date on which the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is made (the “Calculation
**Date”), then the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio will be calculated giving pro forma effect (as determined by a**
responsible accounting or financial officer of the Senior Notes Issuer) (including in respect of anticipated cost savings
and expense and cost reduction and expense and cost synergies reasonably anticipated to be taken within 24 months) to
such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other discharge of
Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable
reference period; provided, however, that (except with respect to calculations made pursuant to clause (17) of the third


-----

paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) the pro forma calculation shall not give
effect to (i) any Indebtedness Incurred on the Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions described in the second
paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” (other than clause (5)(ii) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or (ii) the discharge on the
Calculation Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to the
provisions described in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”.

In addition, for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio:

(1) acquisitions or Investments (each, a “Purchase”) that have been made by the Senior Notes Issuer or any

Subsidiary acquired by the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, and
including all related financing transactions and including increases in ownership of Restricted Subsidiaries,
during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to the
Calculation Date, or that are to be made on the Calculation Date, will be given pro forma effect (as determined
in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Senior Notes Issuer), including in respect of
anticipated cost savings and expense and cost reduction and expense and cost synergies reasonably anticipated
to be taken within 24 months, as if they had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period;
_provided that, if a Definitive Agreement has been entered into with respect to a Purchase that is part of the_
transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be
calculated after giving pro forma effect to such Purchase (including anticipated cost savings and expense and
cost reduction and expense and cost synergies reasonably anticipated to be taken within 24 months) as if such
Purchase had occurred on the first day of such period, even if the Purchase has not yet been consummated as of
the date of determination;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued operations, as determined
in accordance with GAAP, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating
unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma
basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period (taking into account anticipated cost savings
resulting from any such disposal, as determined by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Senior
Notes Issuer);

(3) the Fixed Charges attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and
operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and ownership interests
therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition
occurred on the first day of such period, but only to the extent that the obligations giving rise to such Fixed
Charges will not be obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary following the
Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a Restricted
Subsidiary at all times during such four-quarter period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such four-quarter period; and

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be calculated
as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into
account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness), and if any Indebtedness is not
denominated in the Senior Notes Issuer’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for purposes of the calculation
of Consolidated Net Leverage shall be treated in accordance with GAAP.

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Fixed Charges and
Consolidated Net Income, (a) calculations will be as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting
officer of the Senior Notes Issuer (including in respect of anticipated expense and cost reductions and expense and cost
synergies as though the full effect of such expense and cost reductions and expense and cost synergies were realized on
the first day of the relevant period and shall also include the reasonably anticipated full run rate cost savings effect (as
calculated in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Senior Notes Issuer) of cost savings
programs, business optimization programs or other restructurings or reorganizations that have been initiated by a member
of the Group as though programs, restructurings or reorganizations had been fully implemented on the first day of the
relevant period (regardless of whether these cost savings and expense and cost reduction and expense and cost synergies


-----

could then be reflected in pro forma financial statements to the extent prepared); provided that such anticipated expense
and cost reductions and expense and cost synergies and cost savings are reasonably anticipated to be taken within 24
months after the consummation of the cost savings program, business optimization program, restructuring,
reorganizations or any operational change or the Purchase or sale which is expected to result in such anticipated expense
and cost reductions and synergies and cost savings), and (b) in determining the amount of Indebtedness outstanding on
any date of determination and Fixed Charges for the relevant period, pro forma effect shall be given to any Incurrence,
assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase, defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness as if such transaction had
occurred on the first day of the relevant period.

Facilities or one or more other credit or other agreements, indentures, financing agreements or otherwise) and in each

foregoing (including any notes and letters of credit issued pursuant thereto and any Guarantee and collateral agreement,

Subsidiaries) for which internal financial statements are available (excluding the notes thereto). For purposes of

The Board of Directors of the Senior Notes Issuer may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted

**Book-Entry; Delivery and Form**

**General**

Each series of Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (each, a “Rule 144A Global
**Note”). Each series of Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially**
be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (each, a “Regulation S Global Note”
and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue
Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Notes may only be offered or sold within the United States pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (“Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of interests in
the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or
persons who hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on
behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective
depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive
certificated form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained in the bookentry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be issued
only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain
states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in
definitive certificated form (“Definitive Registered Notes”). The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own,
transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests
will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the owners or “holders” of
Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or the common
depositary’s nominee), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the relevant Indenture
governing the Notes. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own BookEntry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the relevant Indenture.

Neither we, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, nor any of their respective affiliates will
have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will
distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests
in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption
price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by
Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof).
We understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be
redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis
(with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate unless otherwise required
by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less
than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.


-----

**Payments on Global Notes**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, and
interest) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common depositary or its nominee
for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary
procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any
present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law
and as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes”. If any such
deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes” above, we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order for the_
net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or
withholding to equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global
Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through
such participants.

Under the terms of the Indentures, the Issuers, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of
their respective agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (the common depositary for Euroclear or
Clearstream or its nominee) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, none of the Issuers, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their
respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for: any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or
any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, or Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant;
payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to payments made on
account of a Book-Entry Interest; or Euroclear, Clearstream, or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such
participants as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “stock name”.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will be
paid through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only
at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests are credited and only in respect of
such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of
any other action in respect of the Global Notes.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and Clearstream
rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive
Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in jurisdictions that require physical delivery of
securities or to pledge such Notes, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with
the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set out in the Indentures.

The Global Notes will have a legend to the effect set out under “Transfer Restrictions”. Book-Entry Interests in the Global
Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under “Transfer Restrictions”.


-----

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S BookEntry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indentures) to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other
exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes
is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in
accordance with the Notice to Investors described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable
securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S
Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the relevant Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned
Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all
transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long
as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indentures, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes (i) if
Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuers that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a successor
depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days; or (ii) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such an exchange
in writing delivered through either Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indentures and
enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indentures.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such
Note by surrendering it to the Registrar or the Transfer Agent. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a
holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will
be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance
of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no
Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 will be issued. We will bear the cost of preparing, printing,
packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes.

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of 15 calendar days
preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any date fixed for redemption of the Notes or
(iii) any date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. Also, we are not required to register the transfer or
exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in
connection with a change of control offer or asset disposition offer. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered
Note, the Trustees, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indentures. We may require a holder to pay any taxes and fees
required by law and permitted by the Indentures and the Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Note has been lost,
destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered to the Registrar or
Transfer Agent or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustees (or an authentication agent appointed
by it) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustees’ and our requirements are met. The Issuers
or the Trustees may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond
sufficient in the judgment of both to protect themselves, the Trustees or the Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar


-----

appointed pursuant to the Indentures from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced.
The Issuers may charge for any expenses incurred by us in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and
payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuers, pursuant to the provisions of the Indentures, the Issuers in
their discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive
Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes only after the
transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indentures) to the effect
that such transfer will comply with the Notice to Investors applicable to such notes. Please see “Transfer Restrictions”.

Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at the
office of the Issuers’ paying agent in London.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuers, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar and their
respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person
will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Notes will be evidenced through registration from
time to time at the registered office of the registrar, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

The Issuers will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests
may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. We
provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations
and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither
we, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those
operations or procedures.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for
participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their
respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and
borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets.
Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others
such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear
or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants
and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not
participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by
the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical
delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be
limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions
attributable to the Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of
interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in
accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.


-----

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests
in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to
perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None
of us, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility for the performance
by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the
rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream
accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests
will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the
settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds.
Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry
Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the
desired value date.


-----

**Transfer Restrictions**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the Notes_
_offered hereby._

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities

II); or not a “qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation, and only to investors who, if resident in the UK
are not retail investors, defined as a person who is one (or more) of the following (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8)
of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement
Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article
2(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

We have not registered and will not register the Notes or the Guarantees under the U.S. Securities Act and, therefore, the
Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Accordingly, we are offering and selling the Notes to
the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

� in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers”, commonly referred to as “QIBs”, as defined in Rule 144A
in compliance with Rule 144A; and

� to persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S.

We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed
with the Issuers and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or any other applicable state securities laws, and that the Notes are being offered for resale in
transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities law, including sales
pursuant to Rule 144A, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in
compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable state securities
laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance
with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) It is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) of the Issuers or acting on behalf of the Issuers and it is either:

(a) a QIB and is aware that any sale of the Notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A, and the
acquisition of the Notes will be for its own account or for the account of another QIB; or

(b) purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S and if it is an investor
resident in a Member State of the EEA, it is a qualified investor (within the meaning of Article 2(e) of
the Prospectus Regulation and any relevant implementing measure in each Member State of the EEA).

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar or the Initial Purchasers, or any person representing any of them, have made any representation to it


-----

with respect to the offering or sale of any Notes other than the information contained in this offering memorandum,
which offering memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment
decision with respect to the Notes. It has had access to such financial and other information concerning us, the
Issuers and its subsidiaries and the Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase
any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuers and the
Initial Purchasers. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial
Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this offering memorandum.
It acknowledges that we, and not the Initial Purchasers, have ultimate authority over the statements contained in
this offering memorandum, including the content of those statements and whether and how to communicate them.

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is acting as a
fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws, subject to any requirement
of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within
its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or
any other exemption from registration available under the U.S. Securities Act.

(5) It will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree that either (a) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so
long as it holds a Note or any interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of), (i) an “employee
benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to Title I of ERISA, (ii) a “plan” as defined in
and subject to Section 4975 of the Code, (iii) an entity whose underlying assets include the assets of any such
employee benefit plan subject to ERISA or other plan subject to Section 4975 of the Code (each of the foregoing,

local or non-U.S. law or regulation that is substantially similar to the provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or
Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Law”), or (b) its acquisition, holding and disposition of the Note (or any
interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code or, in the case of a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, a violation of any Similar
Law

(6) If it is a Benefit Plan Investor, it will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Issuers, the
Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any other party to the transactions referred to in
this offering memorandum, or other persons that provide marketing services, or any of their respective affiliates,
has provided, and none of them will provide, any investment recommendation or investment advice on which it,
or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Benefit Plan Investor (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied as
a primary basis in connection with its decision to invest in the Issued Notes, and they are not otherwise undertaking
to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the Benefit Plan
Investor or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the Benefit Plan Investor’s acquisition of the Issued Notes; and
(ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Issued Notes.

(7) Each holder of Notes issued in reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A Notes”) agrees on its own behalf and on
behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Rule 144A
Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the
date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is one year after the later of the Notes Issue Date and the
last date on which the Issuers or any of its affiliates was the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) only
(i) to the Issuers, the Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been
declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to

QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (iv) pursuant to offers and
sales that occur outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S, or (v) pursuant to any other available
exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to
any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be
at all times within its or their control and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any
applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuers’ and the Trustees’ rights prior to any such


-----

offer, sale or transfer pursuant to clause (v) to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the
reverse of the security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustees. The foregoing restrictions on
resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date. Each purchaser acknowledges that
each Rule 144A Note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

**Tax Considerations**

**Certain French Tax Consequences**

The following is a summary of certain French withholding tax considerations pertaining to the ownership of the Notes.
Comments which are included therein are reported only for information purposes and do not aim at giving a complete
analysis of the tax rules that may affect the Issuers the Notes or the investors. This summary is based on provisions of
French tax laws and regulations, as in force and applied by the French tax authorities at the date of this offering
memorandum, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect, or to different interpretations.
Accordingly, no opinion is expressed herein with regard to any system of law other than the laws of France as applied by
French courts as of the date of this offering memorandum. Any investor contemplating to acquire the Notes should therefore
consult its own tax adviser about the tax consequences that may arise for it as a result of the acquisition, the ownership, the
disposal or the redemption of the Notes.

**_Withholding taxes on payments made outside France_**

Holders of the Notes who concurrently hold shares of the Issuer may also be impacted by other rules not described in this
section.

Payments of interest and assimilated revenues made by the relevant Issuer with respect to the relevant Notes, as applicable,
will not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code unless such payments are
made outside France in a non-cooperative State or territory (Etat ou territoire non coopératif) within the meaning of Article
238-0 A of the French Tax Code (a “Non-Cooperative State”) other than those States or territories mentioned in 2° of 2
_bis of the same Article 238-0 A, irrespective of the holder’s fiscal domicile or registered headquarters. If such payments_
are made outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those States or territories mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article
238-0 A of the French Tax Code, a 75% withholding tax is applicable to such payments (subject to certain exceptions and
to more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty) by virtue of Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code. The
list of Non-Cooperative States is published by a ministerial executive order (arrêté) which is updated each year.

Furthermore, according to the third and fourth paragraphs of Article 238 A of the French Tax Code, interest and assimilated
revenues with respect to the Notes will not be deductible from the relevant Issuer’s taxable result if they are paid or accrued
to persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account held in a financial institution
established in such a Non-Cooperative State (the “Deductibility Exclusion”). Under certain conditions, any such nondeductible interest and assimilated revenues may be re-characterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et
_seq. of the French Tax Code, in which case they may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of_
the French Tax Code, at (i) the standard corporate income tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the second paragraph of
Article 219-I of the French Tax Code, 26.5% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and 25% for fiscal years
beginning as from January 1, 2022) for payments benefiting legal persons who are not French tax residents, (ii) a rate of
12.8% for payments benefiting individuals who are not French tax residents or (iii) a rate of 75% for payments made
outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax
Code (in each case subject to certain exceptions and to more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code
nor, to the extent that the relevant interest and assimilated revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal
or exaggerated amount, the Deductibility Exclusion and the related withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the
French Tax Code that may be levied as a result of such Deductibility Exclusion will apply in respect of the Notes if the
relevant Issuer can prove that the main purpose and effect of the issue of the Notes was not that of locating the interest in
a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”). Pursuant to the administrative guidelines published by the French tax
authorities regarding this legislation (BOI-INT-DG-20-50 dated 11/02/2014, § 550 and 990 (the “BOFIP”)), the Notes will
benefit from the Exception without the relevant Issuer having to provide any evidence supporting the main purpose and
effect of the issue of the Notes, and accordingly will be able to automatically benefit from the Exception (the “Safe
**Harbour”), if the Notes are:**


-----

� offered by means of a public offering within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French Monetary and Financial
Code for which the publication of a prospectus is mandatory or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a state other
than a Non-Cooperative State (for this purpose, an “equivalent offering” means any offering requiring the
registration or submission of an offering document by or with a foreign securities market authority); and/or

� admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or multilateral financial instruments trading facility
provided that such market or facility is not located in a Non-Cooperative State and that such market is operated
by a market operator, an investment services provider, or by such other similar foreign entity that is not located
in a Non-Cooperative State; and/or

� admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities delivery and payment
systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, or of one or
more similar foreign depositaries or operators provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a NonCooperative State.

The Notes issued by the relevant Issuer under this offering memorandum qualify as debt securities under French
commercial law. Since the Notes will be admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of Euroclear and Clearstream,
_i.e. both securities delivery and payment systems operators within the meaning of Article L. 561-2 of the French Monetary_
and Financial Code which are not located in a Non-Cooperative State, payments made by the relevant Issuer in respect of
the Notes to their holders will fall under the Safe Harbour and will thus not be subject to the withholding tax set out under
Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code, as construed by the French tax authorities under the BOFIP. Moreover, under
the same conditions, pursuant to the BOFIP and to the extent that the relevant interest and other assimilated revenues relate
to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, interest and assimilated revenues paid by the
relevant Issuer on the Notes should not be subject to the Deductibility Exclusion and, as a result, should not be subject to
the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code solely on account of their being paid on an
account held in a financial institution established in a Non-Cooperative State or accrued or paid to persons established or
domiciled in a Non-Cooperative State.

**_Withholding taxes on payments made to individuals fiscally domiciled in France_**

Pursuant to Article 125 A I of the French Tax Code, when the paying agent (établissement payeur) is established in France
and subject to certain exceptions, interest and similar income received by individuals fiscally domiciled (domiciliés
_fiscalement) in France may be subject to a 12.8% withholding tax, which is deductible from their personal income tax_
liability in respect of the year in which the payment has been made. Social contributions (CSG, CRDS and solidarity levy)
are also levied by way of withholding at an aggregate rate of 17.2% on such interest and similar income received by
individuals fiscally domiciled (domiciliés fiscalement) in France, subject to certain exceptions.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Notes by a U.S. Holder or Non-U.S. Holder (each as defined below), who purchases the Notes in the
Offering upon original issuance at their issue price (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the
investors for cash (excluding sales to bondhouses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of
underwriter placement agent or wholesaler), but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. This
summary is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued
thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are
subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) have been or are
expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a
different position concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the
Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light
of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws,
such as financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities,


-----

U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, grantor trusts, tax-exempt organizations, regulated
investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities (or investors in such
entities), persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle”, “hedge”, “conversion
transaction” or other integrated transaction and persons who own, directly, indirectly, or constructively ten percent (10%)
or more of the Issuers’ stock. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who hold the Notes as capital assets within
the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. This discussion does not address any tax consequences other than U.S. federal
income tax consequences and does not address the Medicare tax on certain investment income, the base erosion and antiabuse tax or special tax accounting rules that apply as a result of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into
account on an applicable financial statement. Further, this discussion does not address any consequences that may result
pursuant to Treasury regulations promulgated under section 385 of the Code with respect to any holder that is considered
related to the relevant Issuer for the purposes of such regulations.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of an Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a
corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any
estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court
within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S.
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust
as a U.S. person. A “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Notes that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership.

If any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in
the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. A
holder that is a partnership, and partners in such partnerships, should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. The discussion below assumes that the Notes will
be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of holding Notes in
light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed
below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws and state, local, foreign or other tax laws.

**_Additional Amounts_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption”, “Description of the Senior
_Notes—Optional Redemption”, “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Change of Control”), we may be obliged to pay amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on the_
Notes. Our obligation to pay such excess amounts may implicate the provisions of the Treasury regulations relating to
“contingent payment debt instruments”. Under these regulations, however, one or more contingencies will not cause a debt
instrument to be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument if, as of the Issue Date, such contingencies in the aggregate
are considered “remote” or “incidental”. We believe and intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies should
be treated as remote and/or incidental. Our position is binding on a holder, unless the holder discloses in the proper manner
to the IRS that it is taking a different position. However, this determination is inherently factual and we can give you no
assurance that our position would be sustained if challenged by the IRS. A successful challenge of this position by the IRS
could require a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation to accrue ordinary income at a rate that is higher than the
stated interest rate and to treat any gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income,
rather than capital gain. The remainder of this disclosure assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent payment
debt instruments. Prospective purchasers are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the potential application to
the Notes of the contingent payment debt regulations and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of Interest_**

Stated interest on the Notes (including any non-U.S. tax withheld on such payments and any Additional Amounts) will be
taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the holder’s method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.


-----

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment
(including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of the Notes), based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is
in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. Holder generally will not realize exchange gain or loss on the interest
payment but may realize exchange gain or loss when the holder disposes of any euros it receives. An accrual basis U.S.
Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest payment denominated in euro in
accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average
exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years
of the U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable year).

Under the second method, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis
of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable
years of the U.S. Holder, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within the taxable year).
Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an
electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect
on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning
of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder and will be irrevocable
without the consent of the IRS.

Upon an accrual basis U.S. Holder’s receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid
interest upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes) denominated in euro, the U.S. Holder
may recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss and generally U.S. source) equal to the difference
between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the amount previously
accrued, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

If the Notes are issued at an “issue price” which is less than the stated principal amount the Notes will be considered to
have been issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless the difference is less
than a de minimis threshold (equal to 1/4 of 1% of the Notes’ stated principal amount multiplied by the number of complete
years to maturity from their “issue date”). The “issue date” is the first date upon which a substantial amount of the Notes
is sold for cash to persons other than bondhouses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of
underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers.

A U.S. Holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer) generally will be required to include OID with respect to the
notes in gross income (as ordinary income) as the OID accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis), before the receipt of
cash payments attributable to such OID. In general, the amount of OID includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder will
generally be equal to a ratable amount of OID with respect to the Notes for each day in an accrual period during the taxable
year or portion of the taxable year on which a U.S. Holder held the Notes. An accrual period may be of any length and the
accrual periods may vary in length over the term of the Notes, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year
and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the final day of an accrual period or on the first day
of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period is an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the
product of the Notes’ adjusted issue price at the beginning of such accrual period and its yield to maturity, determined on
the basis of a compounding assumption that reflects the length of the accrual period over (ii) the sum of the stated interest
payments on the notes allocable to the accrual period. The adjusted issue price of the Notes at the beginning of any accrual
period generally equals the issue price of the Notes increased by the amount of all previously accrued OID.

A U.S. Holder of Notes treated as issued with OID must (i) determine OID allocable to each accrual period in euros using
the constant yield method described above, and (ii) translate the amount of OID into U.S. dollars and recognize foreign
currency gain or loss in the same manner as described above for stated interest accrued by an accrual basis U.S. Holder
when the OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable
to OID previously included in income). U.S. Holders should note that because the cash payment in respect of accrued OID
on the Notes will not be made until maturity or other disposal of the Notes, a greater possibility exists for fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates (and the required recognition of exchange gain or loss) than is the case for foreign currency


-----

instruments issued without OID. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the interplay between the
application of the OID and foreign currency exchange gain or loss rules.

The rules regarding OID are complex and the rules described above may not apply in all cases. Accordingly, you should
consult your own tax advisors regarding their application.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

A U.S. Holder may be entitled to deduct or credit foreign taxes, if any, imposed on interest (including Additional Amounts)
and accrued OID (if applicable), subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit taxes applies
to all of such U.S. Holder’s other applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest income on a Note generally
will constitute foreign source income and be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit
allowable to U.S. Holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application
of complex rules that depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances and there are significant limitations on a U.S.
Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of
foreign tax credits.

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes or the Notes_**

Generally, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will
recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition (less any amount
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest not previously included in income, which will be taxable as such) and such U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be its U.S. dollar cost
(as defined below) reduced by the amount of any principal paid on the Note, if any, and increased by the amount of
previously accrued OID, if any. The U.S. dollar cost of a Note purchased with euros will be the U.S. dollar value of the
euros paid for the Note determined at the spot rate on the relevant issue date. The amount realized on a sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition for an amount in euro will be the U.S. dollar value of this amount based on the spot
rate on the date of the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual method
taxpayer, the settlement date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, if the Notes are traded on an
established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes). The election referred to in this paragraph must be
applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An
accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not make such election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are
exchange rate fluctuations between the date of the sale and the settlement date.

Except as described in the next paragraph, gain or loss on a disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source capital gain
or loss. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than
one year at the time of disposition. A non-corporate U.S. Holder generally will be eligible for reduced rates of taxation on
any long-term capital gain recognized. Deductions for capital losses are subject to limitations.

A portion of a U.S. Holder’s gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated as exchange gain
or loss. Such exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source income or
loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note generally is the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the Note
calculated in euro on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss is equal to the difference between (i)
the U.S. dollar value of such principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition of the Note (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date
of such purchase and taxable disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of such principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date the
U.S. Holder purchased the Note. Any such exchange rate gain or loss (including any exchange gain or loss with respect to
the receipt of accrued but unpaid interest or accrued OID, if any) will be realized only to the extent of total gain or loss
realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition.


-----

**_Reportable Transactions_**

Under Treasury regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances,
the receipt of interest on a note, or a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or
foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note to the extent that any such receipt, sale, exchange, retirement
or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. U.S. Holders should consult their tax
advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any
requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Certain Information Reporting Requirements with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals are required to file IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial
Assets as defined in section 6038D of the Code) to report information relating to an interest in the Notes, subject to certain
exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions). Under certain
circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of the foregoing rules. U.S. Holders should consult
their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of these requirements on their ownership and disposition of the Notes.
Penalties may apply for failure to properly complete and file IRS Form 8938.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally should not be subject to U.S. federal
income or withholding tax on any payments on the Notes and gain from the sale, redemption or other disposition of the
Notes unless: (i) that payment and/or gain is effectively connected with the conduct by that Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or
business in the U.S.; (ii) in the case of any gain realized on the sale or exchange of a Note by an individual Non-U.S.
Holder, that Holder is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the sale, exchange or retirement and
certain other conditions are met; or (iii) the Non-U.S. Holder is subject to tax pursuant to provisions of the Code applicable
to certain expatriates.

**_Backup Withholding and Related Information Reporting Requirements_**

In general, payments of interest (including the accrual of OID, if any) and the proceeds from sales or other dispositions
(including retirements or redemptions) of Notes held by a U.S. Holder may be required to be reported to the IRS unless the
U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient and, when required, demonstrates this fact. In addition, a U.S. Holder that is not an
exempt recipient may be subject to backup withholding unless it provides a taxpayer identification number and otherwise
complies with applicable certification requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a U.S.
Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the appropriate
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

In general, payments of principal and interest in respect of, and the proceeds from sales of, the Notes, payable to a NonU.S. Holder by a U.S. paying agent or other U.S. intermediary will not be subject to backup withholding tax and information
reporting requirements if appropriate certification (IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other appropriate form) is provided by the
Non-U.S. Holder to the payor and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the certificate is false.

**Certain Other Tax Considerations; Payments by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes it is possible that such payments may be subject to
withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double
taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. Holders may be eligible to receive a gross up from the payor
with respect to the amounts withheld, subject to certain exceptions, as described in “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Withholding Taxes” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Withholding Taxes”. Holders of Notes should consult_
with their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a Guarantor makes any payments with respect to the Notes.


-----

**Certain ERISA Considerations**

Unless otherwise provided in any supplement to this offering memorandum, the Issued Notes should be eligible for
purchase by employee benefit plans and other plans subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code and by governmental, church and nonU.S. plans that are subject to any federal, state, local or non-U.S. law or regulation that is substantially similar to the
provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Law”) subject to consideration of the
issues described in this section. ERISA imposes certain requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) that are subject to ERISA, on entities such as collective investment funds and separate accounts
whose underlying assets include the assets of such plans (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are
fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA's general fiduciary
requirements, including the requirements of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA
Plan's investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan. The prudence of a particular
investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan's
particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment including, but not limited to, the matters
discussed under “Risk Factors”.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan
(as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual
retirement accounts (together with ERISA Plans, the “Plans”)) and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” or
**“disqualified persons”) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is**
applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person, including a Plan fiduciary, who engages in a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

The Issuers, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any other party to the transactions referred
to in this offering memorandum may be parties in interest or disqualified persons with respect to many Plans. Prohibited
transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if any of the Issued Notes
is acquired or held by a Plan, including but not limited to where the Issuers, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent, the Registrar or any other party to such transactions is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Certain exemptions
from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable,
however, depending in part on the type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire any Issued Notes and the
circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to transactions between a person that is a party in interest (other than a fiduciary
or an affiliate that has or exercises discretionary authority or control or renders investment advice with respect to assets
involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the plan, provided that there is adequate consideration
for the transaction), Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective
investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by a qualified professional asset manager), PTCE 95-60
(relating to transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance
company pooled separate accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions determined by in-house asset managers).
Prospective investors should consult with their advisors regarding the prohibited transaction rules and these exemptions.
There can be no assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any
particular transaction involving any Issued Notes.

Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA)
and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions
of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless
be subject to Similar Law. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Issued
Notes to determine the need for, if necessary, and the availability of, any exemptive relief under any Similar Law.

In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor has promulgated a regulation, 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by
Section 3(42) of ERISA (the “Plan Asset Regulation”), describing what constitutes the assets of a Plan with respect to the
Plan's investment in an entity for purposes of certain provisions of ERISA, including the fiduciary responsibility provisions
of Title I of ERISA, Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. Under the Plan Asset Regulation, if a Plan
invests in an equity interest of an entity that is neither a publicly-offered security nor a security issued by an investment


-----

company registered under the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan's assets include both the equity
interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity's underlying assets, unless one of the exceptions to such treatment
described in the Plan Asset Regulation applies. Under the Plan Asset Regulation, a security which is in the form of debt
may be considered an equity interest if it has substantial equity features. If an Issuer was deemed under the Plan Asset
Regulation to hold plan assets by reason of a Plan's investment in any of the Issued Notes, such plan assets would include
an undivided interest in the assets held by the Issuer and transactions by the Issuer would be subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section
4975 of the Code. The Plan Asset Regulation provides, however, that if equity participation in any entity by “Benefit Plan
Investors” is not significant, then the “look-through” rule will not apply to such entity. The term “Benefit Plan Investors”
is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation to include (1) any “employee benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA
that is subject to Title I of ERISA, (2) any “plan” as described in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code, and (3) any
entity whose underlying assets include the assets of any such employee benefit plan subject to ERISA or other plan subject
to Section 4975 of the Code. Equity participation by Benefit Plan Investors in any entity is significant if, immediately after
the most recent acquisition of any equity interest in the entity, 25% or more of the total value of any class of equity interests
in the entity (excluding the value of any interests held by certain persons, other than Benefit Plan Investors, having or
exercising control over the assets of the entity or providing investment advice to the entity for a fee (direct or indirect) or
any “affiliates” (as defined in the Plan Asset Regulation) of such persons) is held by Benefit Plan Investors. If, as a result
of any investment, 25% or more of the total value of any class of equity interests in the Issuers is being held by Benefit
Plan Investors, the applicable Issued Notes may be redeemed by the Issuers. While there is little pertinent authority in this
area and no assurance can be given, the Issuers believe that the Issued Notes should not be treated as equity interests for
the purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation and, therefore, the Plan Asset Regulation should not apply and any such
redemptions would not be necessary.

Accordingly, except as otherwise provided in any supplement to this offering memorandum, each purchaser and subsequent
transferee of any Issued Notes will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree, on each day from the date on which the
purchaser or transferee acquires such Issued Notes (or any interest therein) through and including the date on which the
purchaser or transferee disposes of such Issued Notes (or any interest therein), either that (a) it is not, and is not acting on
behalf of (and for so long as it holds such Issued Notes or any interests therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf
of), a Benefit Plan Investor or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan which is subject to any Similar Law or (b) its
acquisition, holding and disposition of such Issued Notes (or any interest therein) will not constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or, in the case of a governmental,
church or non-U.S. plan subject to Similar Law, a violation of any Similar Law.

Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of any Issued Notes that is a Benefit Plan Investor will be further deemed to
represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Issuers, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar
or any other party to the transactions referred to in this offering memorandum, or other persons that provide marketing
services, or any of their respective affiliates, has provided, and none of them will provide, any investment recommendation
or investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Benefit Plan Investor (“Plan
**Fiduciary”), has relied as a primary basis in connection with its decision to invest in the Issued Notes, and they are not**
otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the
Benefit Plan Investor or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the Benefit Plan Investor’s acquisition of the Issued Notes;
and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Issued Notes.

Each Plan Fiduciary who is responsible for making the investment decisions whether to purchase or commit to purchase
and to hold any of the Issued Notes should determine whether, under the documents and instruments governing the Plan,
an investment in such Issued Notes is appropriate for the Plan, taking into account the overall investment policy of the Plan
and the composition of the Plan's investment portfolio. Any Plan proposing to invest in such Issued Notes (including any
governmental, church or non-U.S. plan) should consult with its counsel to confirm that such investment will not constitute
or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction and will satisfy the other requirements of ERISA and the Code (or, in the
case of a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, any Similar Law).

The sale of any Issued Notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by the Issuers, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any other party to the transactions that such an investment meets all relevant legal


-----

requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate
for Plans generally or any particular Plan.

**Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law**
**Considerations**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests in each_
_of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantees or Collateral are being provided. It is a summary only, and proceedings of_
_bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of_
_organization of a future Guarantor of the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could_
_trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply, and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights_
_and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests on the Collateral._

_Also set out below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in certain EU jurisdiction’s including France_
_and Belgium. In the event that any one or more of the Issuers or the Guarantors, it is not possible to predict with certainty_
_in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such_
_proceedings._

**European Union**

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency
proceedings, recast as amended, in particular by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of July 4, 2018 (the “Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), the courts
of the Member State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the Insolvency
Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor.

The center of main interest is defined as the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular
basis and which is ascertainable by third parties. In the case of a debtor or legal person, the place of the registered office
shall be presumed to be the center of its main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only
apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request
for the opening of insolvency proceedings (as defined in Article (4) of the Insolvency Regulation).

The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different
Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

A debtor’s center of main interests is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the
purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the
filing of the insolvency petition. In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the
debtor conducts the majority of its business and the perception of the debtor’s creditors as regards to the local center of the
debtor’s business operations may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the debtor has its “center of main
interests”. Accordingly, and as the presumption that the registered office is the center of main interests is rebuttable, the
relevant court of a Member State must carefully assess whether the center of the debtor’s main interests is genuinely located
in that Member State. It may be possible to rebut this presumption where the debtor’s central administration is located in a
Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors
establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and supervision
and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State.

If the center of main interests of a debtor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the
main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such
jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings
referred to in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the
Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary
proceedings may be commenced in another Member State.

If the center of main interests of a debtor is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary territorial
insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined


-----

in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined
to mean a place of operations where the debtor carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its center of main interests,
any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be
secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor
situated in the territory of such other Member State.

Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its center of main interests have not yet been
commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an
establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s
center of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are
commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment
situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (ii) a public
authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right
to request the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will,
subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the _lex fori concursus, i.e. the local insolvency law of the court that has_
assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, the courts of the Member State within
the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly
from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the
rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific
assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated
within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include:

� the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income
from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

� the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by
assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

� the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary
to the wishes of the party so entitled;

� a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main
proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have
been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to
commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s center of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on
it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member
State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member
State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings
in that other Member State where the debtor has assets.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court of the main
proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member State in which the main proceedings are
located in another Member State as long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in such other Member State or
any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in such
other Member State. He may, in particular, subject to the preservation of third parties’ rights in rem pursuant to Article 8


-----

of the EU Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to
Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove assets of the company from that other Member State.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also
stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the
main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the
creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court
stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings
and of individual classes of creditors.

Following the entry into force of the Insolvency Regulation, there is an increased scrutiny in situations where there has
been a recent center of main interests shift. Where a company’s center of main interests has shifted in the preceding 3
months the rebuttable presumption that its center of main interests is at the place of its registered office will no longer
apply. Also, the opening of secondary proceedings in another EU Member State—which will no longer be limited only to
“winding-up proceedings”—will be possible not only if the debtor has an establishment in such EU Member State at the
time of the opening of main insolvency proceedings, but also if the debtor had an establishment in such EU Member State
in the three-month period prior to the request of opening of main insolvency proceedings.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuers, the Guarantors or any of the Guarantors’ subsidiaries experience financial
difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings
would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of
the obligations and the security of the Issuers and the Guarantors.

**_EU Directive on Preventive Restructuring Frameworks_**

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive restructuring
frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures
concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on
restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was published on June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in
financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue
operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt
after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures
concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length.

The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency,
discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring
procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that
encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that
insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the EU Restructuring Directive
provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must
be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of
which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in
separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not
more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number
of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under
certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to
the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or
administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with
the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan.


-----

The EU Restructuring Directive must be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by July 17, 2021
(with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for which the time period
for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024 or, in others respects, on July 17, 2026), subject to a
maximum one year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering particular difficulties in
implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

Although which proceedings will be affected by the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into French law has
not yet been determined, it seems likely that safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard and judicial
reorganization proceedings will be substantially amended to take into consideration the provisions of the Directive.

The major differences between the Directive and current French insolvency law lie in:

(a) the introduction of classes of creditors into French law based on a commonality of interests as opposed to the
current classification of creditors in accordance with the nature of their contractual relationship with the debtor
and irrespective of their actual chances of repayment, i.e. as credit institutions, main suppliers or bondholders;
and

(b) the possibility to set up shareholders as one specific class when their rights may be impaired, allowing other
classes of creditors to impose a plan on shareholders, which can only occur in very restrictive circumstances under
current French law.

**France**

We conduct part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the registered office of any member of the Group
(such as French Guarantor or Issuer) is in France (to the extent however that its center of main interests, within the meaning
of EU Insolvency Regulation, is not in another jurisdiction), it would be subject to French proceedings affecting creditors,
including court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or _conciliation_ proceedings) and court-administered proceedings
being either safeguard proceedings (procedure de sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard proceedings (procedure de
_sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procedure de sauvegarde financière accélérée),_
judicial reorganization proceedings (procedure de redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (procedure
_de liquidation judiciaire). In addition, any company of our Group having its center of main interests, within the meaning_
of EU Insolvency Regulation or, if not applicable, its main center of interests within the meaning of article R.600-1 of the
French Commercial Code or an establishment in France, could also be subject to French court administered proceedings.
Any company of our groupe having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State could be subject
to French territorial insolvency proceedings.

Specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or insolvency proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or exceed (on a
stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (x) 20 million euros in turnover and 250 employees
or (y) 40 million euros in turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings with respect to which the court’s international
jurisdiction results from the application of the EU Insolvency Regulation or (iii) in cases where the EU Regulation does
not apply, from the debtor having its main center of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts.

In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a corporate group has
jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having international jurisdiction with respect
to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above and to specific control thresholds); accordingly, a court can
supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator and
creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of the group.

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the
payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and/or the Guarantees granted by
the French Guarantors and corresponding security interests.

Under the European Council Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings, if a debtor is
incorporated in the European Union (other than Denmark), French courts shall have jurisdiction over the main insolvency


-----

proceedings if the debtor’s center of main interests is situated in France. In the case of a debtor or legal person, the place
of the registered office shall be presumed to be its center of main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary. In
determining whether the center of main interests of a debtor is in France, French courts will take into account a broad range
of factual elements.

_The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law for informational purposes only_
_and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Notes. Such proceedings_
_will likely be amended in the context of the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into French law with respect_
_to which French statute n° 2019-486 dated 22 May 2019 (“Loi Pacte”) grants the French government twenty-four months_
_to enact appropriate measures through ordinances for the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive.Warning_
_Procedure (procédure d’alerte)_

In order to anticipate a debtor’s difficulties to the extent possible, French law provides for warning procedures. When there
are elements which they believe put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy, the statutory auditors of a
company must request the management to provide an explanation. Failing satisfactory explanation or appropriate corrective
measures, the auditors must request that a board of directors (or the equivalent body), and as the case may be at a later
stage the shareholders’ meeting be convened. Depending on the answers provided to them (and the type of company), the
auditors must inform the President of the relevant commercial or civil court of the warning procedure.

Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’ committee (or in their absence the employees’
representatives) have similar rights.

The President of the relevant commercial or civil court can also himself summon the management to provide explanations
on elements which the President of the relevant commercial or civil court believes put the company’s existence as a going
concern in jeopardy (or when the company has not filed its annual financial statements within the statutory timeframe,
despite his/her injunction).

_Grace Periods_

In addition to the specific provisions of insolvency law discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code.

Pursuant to the provisions of this article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings involving the debtor,
whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s financial
needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment dates of payment obligations and
decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower
than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as published annually by decree by the French government) or
that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the
French Civil Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late
payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge. A creditor cannot contract out of
such grace periods. When the debtor benefits from a conciliation proceeding, these statutory provisions shall be read in
combination with article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code pursuant to which the judge may impose grace periods
on creditors having participated in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) for
their claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement.

**_Out-of-court and in-court proceedings_**

French law distinguishes between:

� court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc and conciliation), which are voluntary proceedings in which the debtor
seeks the help of a third party to negotiate an agreement with all or part of its creditors and stakeholders that puts
an end to its difficulties with a view to, in particular, restructuring its indebtedness. These proceedings are
confidential. The third party is appointed by the President of the competent commercial court upon proposal of
the debtor company but the discussions themselves are conducted outside the court; and


-----

� court-administered proceedings (procédures collectives), which are proceedings, during which payments by the
debtor and legal actions by the creditors are suspended (automatic stay). These proceedings are public and involve
all creditors (except for accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as discussed below). Within this second
category, French law further distinguishes between:

� safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, which
are voluntary proceedings and available to debtors that are facing difficulties they cannot overcome but that are
not insolvent (as defined below); and

� judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, which are mandatory proceedings and must be opened
by debtors that are insolvent.

**_Insolvency Test_**

Under French law, a company is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is unable to pay
its debts as they fall due with its available assets taking into account available credit lines, existing debt rescheduling
agreements and moratoria.

If judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings are commenced, the date of insolvency (état de cessation des
_paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court order commencing the insolvency proceedings, unless the court_
sets an earlier date, which may be up to 18 months before the date of such court order. Except for fraud, the date of
insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement
(homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening
period (période suspecte) (see below).

**_Court-Assisted Proceedings_**

A French company facing difficulties without being insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) (or for 45 calendar days
or less in the case of conciliation proceedings) may request the opening of court-assisted insolvency proceedings (mandat
_ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to help the company reach an agreement with its main creditors and stakeholders_
e.g. agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness. Mandat ad hoc and conciliation are informal proceedings which
can only be initiated by the debtor (in its sole discretion) and are carried out under the supervision of the president of the
relevant court, which do not trigger any stay of enforcement against the debtor.

In practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties (economic or financial)
but are not in a state of insolvency (cessation de paiements) (see “—Insolvency Test” above). They are informal,
confidential and are not limited in time. They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad
_hoc, whose name can be suggested by the debtor) itself under the supervision of the court and do not automatically involve_
any stay of the claims or pending proceedings The duties of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court
that appoints him or her. _Mandataires ad hoc_ are usually appointed to facilitate negotiations with creditors but cannot
coerce the creditors into accepting any proposal. The restructuring agreement reached between the debtor and its main
creditors (if any) will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis; those creditors not willing to take part
cannot be bound by the arrangement. Creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their
claims but, in practice, those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for a certain
period of time, to try to negotiate a consensual solution with the company. In any event, the debtor retains the right to
petition the relevant judge for a grace period, as set forth above. The agreement reached is reported to the court but is not
formally approved by it. The ordinance of the court appointing the Mandataire ad hoc shall be notified for informational
purposes to the debtor’s auditors.

_Conciliation_ proceedings are available to a debtor that faces current or foreseeable difficulties of a legal, economic or
financial nature and which (at the time the conciliation proceedings are commenced) has not been in a state of insolvency
(cessation de paiements) (see “—Insolvency Test” above) for more than 45 calendar days. The debtor petitions the President
of the commercial court for the appointment of a conciliator (whose name he can suggest) in charge of assisting the debtor


-----

in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties,
providing e.g. for the restructuring of its indebtedness.

_Conciliation proceedings are confidential (save for their disclosure to statutory auditors if any and subject to the below)_
and may last up to five months. During the proceedings, creditors may continue to individually claim payment of their
claims but they usually accept not to for a certain period of time, to try to negotiate a consensual solution with the company.
In addition, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge who opened the proceedings for grace periods pursuant to
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code as set forth above, in which case the decision would be taken after having heard
the conciliator. The judge also has jurisdiction to grant such a grace period during the implementation of the conciliation
agreement (i.e., after the end of the conciliation proceedings), in relation to claims of creditors (other than public creditors)
who were asked to participate in the _conciliation_ but refused to sign the restructuring agreement (provided that this
agreement has been either acknowledged or approved by a court decision, as described below).The conciliation agreement
reached between the parties may be either:

� upon all parties’ request, acknowledged (constaté) by the President of the commercial court, which makes it
immediately enforceable with legal force of a final judgment, which means that it constitutes a judicial title that
can be enforced by the parties without further recourse to a judge (titre exécutoire). This acknowledgement
decision is not made public; or

� upon the debtor’s request, approved (homologué) by the commercial court if (i) the debtor is not insolvent at the
time or if the rescheduling agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the agreement
effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (iii) the agreement does not infringe
upon the rights of the non-signatory creditors. All the terms of the agreement are not made public but (i) the
existence of the court decision approving the agreement is made public and (ii) this court decision discloses the
guarantees or security interests granted to the parties and the claims that benefit from the so-called New Money
Lien, if any (see below).

So long as the conciliation agreement is in effect, (i) any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to the claims
included in the agreement are suspended and (ii) interest accruing on the affected claims can no longer be compounded.

In case of acknowledgement (constat) or approval (homologation), the court can, at the request of the debtor, appoint the
conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution.

The approval (homologation) by the court, upon the debtor’s request will make the existence of the conciliation proceedings
public and have the following specific consequences:

� creditors who provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the
debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of
payment over all pre-proceedings and post-proceedings claims (except with respect to certain pre-commencement
or post-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of
subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings;

� in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of
insolvency (cessation des paiements), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (as defined below—
see “The Hardening Period (période suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings”,) cannot
be set by the court at a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the court (see
above regarding the definition of the date of the cessation des paiements) except in case of fraud;

� when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its statutory
auditors; and

� in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial
reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the payment date of claims benefiting from the New Money
Lien may not be rescheduled by the court or restructured in the framework of creditors’ committees without their


-----

holders’ consent (the powers of the bondholders’ general assembly in this respect are the subject of debate, in the
case where the New Money Lien applies to bonds).

While the agreement (whether acknowledged or approved) is in force the debtor retains the right to petition the court that
opened conciliation proceedings for a debt rescheduling, pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code as set forth
above, in relation to claims of creditors (other than public creditors) party to the conciliation, in which case the decision
would be taken after having heard the conciliator in the event that he has been appointed to monitor the implementation of
the agreement.

A joint-debtor or third party having granted a guarantee (sûreté personnelle) or a security interest (sûreté réelle) with
respect to the debtor’s obligations can benefit from the grace periods granted to the debtor during the _conciliation_
proceedings as well as from the provisions of the approved or acknowledged conciliation agreement.

In the event of a breach of the conciliation agreement, any party to it can petition the President of the commercial court for
its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be
revoked. Conversely, provided that the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors
with respect to the claims included in the agreement are suspended. The commencement of subsequent insolvency
proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their
claims and any, decreased by the payments already received, and their security interests.

Conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft restructuring plan has been negotiated and is supported by a large
majority of creditors which is likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard without reaching
unanimity, will be a mandatory preliminary step of the accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings, as described below.

In the event of the commencement of subsequent safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, within the context of
the adoption of a safeguard plan or a recovery plan, the court will not be able to impose a payment deferral to a date later
than the date on which the plan is adopted, or debt reductions, to creditors with respect to their claims benefiting from the
New Money Lien.

At the request of the debtor and after the participating creditors have been consulted on the matter, the mandataire ad hoc
or the conciliator may be appointed with a mission to organize the sale of all or part of the business of the debtor which
would be implemented, as applicable, in the context of subsequent insolvency proceedings; any offers received in this
context by the conciliator may be directly submitted to the court in the context of insolvency proceedings after consultation
of the public prosecutor.

Any contractual provision that modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’
rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of
conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end, and any contractual provision requiring the debtor to bear,
by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, for the
portion that would exceed three-quarters of the total fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection
with these proceedings, are deemed null and void.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Safeguard_**

A debtor which experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (en état de cessation des
_paiements). Creditors of the debtor do not attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard_
proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (whose
name can be suggested by the debtor and the public prosecutor) is usually appointed to investigate the business of the
debtor during an observation period (the period from the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the date
on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months, and to help the
debtor elaborate a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will propose to its creditors. Creditors do not
have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor, assisted by the court-appointed


-----

administrator (administrateur judiciaire) who will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment, exercise supervising
control over decisions made by the debtor (“mission de surveillance”) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the
management decisions (“mission d’assistance”) and to prepare a safeguard plan for the company, all under the supervision
of the court.

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements)
before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public
Prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial
reorganization proceedings.

In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (a) judicial reorganization proceedings (i) at any time during
the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (ii) if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if
the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (b) judicial liquidation proceedings at
any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases:

� the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative
or the Public Prosecutor or on its own initiative except in the case of (a)(ii) above where:

� the court may not act upon its own initiative, and

� the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor may only act in
the event that no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors committee and, if any, the bondholders
general meeting (as described below);

� the court's decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors'
representative, the controllers, the State prosecutor and the workers' representatives (if any).

As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately
due and payable.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred prior to the commencement of the
proceedings is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for prior debts
to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights
transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). In addition, creditors are required to declare to the
court-appointed creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) the debts that arose prior to the commencement of the
proceedings (as well as the post-commencement non-privileged debts) and are prohibited from engaging any court
proceedings against the debtor for any payment default in relation to such debts, and the accrual of interest on loans with
a term of less than one year (or on payments deferred for less than one year) is stopped. Debts duly arising after the
commencement of the safeguard proceedings and which relate to expenses necessary for the debtor’s business activities
during the observation period (see above), are for the requirements of the proceedings, or are in consideration for services
rendered or goods delivered to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be
given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the safeguard proceedings (with certain limited exceptions,
such as the New Money Lien).

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the plan (debt forgiveness
and payment terms) prior to the plan being approved by the court.

The rules governing consultation vary according to the size of the business.

_Standard consultation: for debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor or prepared by a certified public_
accountant or, if they are, who have 150 employees or less or a turnover of €20.0 million or less r, the administrator notifies
the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court- appointed creditors’ representative, who obtains the agreement of
each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt remissions and payment times proposed. Creditors are consulted
individually or collectively.


-----

French law does not state whether the proposals for settlement can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle
of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at the consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established
practice, in the absence of a specific legislative prohibition, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided
that it is justified by the specific position of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In
practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of the claim over a shorter
time period instead of a full payment of the claim over ten years.

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved
do not need to be consulted.

Creditors consulted in writing which do not respond within 30 days are deemed to have accepted the proposal. The
creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the administrator and
the controllers.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, if the creditors refuse the proposals that were submitted to them, the court
that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose on them a uniform rescheduling of their claims (subject
to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien – see below) over a maximum period
of ten years (except for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the
maturity date shall remain the same), but no waiver of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without its
creditor’s individual acceptance.

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan
(in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual installment must be of at least 5% of the total amount of the
debt claim) or the year following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the date of the first anniversary of the
adoption of the plan, in which case the amount of the payment is determined in accordance with the specific rules in order
to ensure that the full amount of the claim is repaid within the 10 year period.

_Committee-based consultation: In the case of large companies (whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor or_
established by a certified public accountant and with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million), or,
upon the debtor’s or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the court in the case of debtors that do not exceed
the aforementioned thresholds, two creditors’ committees must be established by the court-appointed administrator on the
basis of the claims that arose prior to the initial judgment:

� one for credit institutions and “similar entities” having granted credit or advances in favor of the debtor; and

� the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the
debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the court-appointed
administrator.

If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes), a general meeting of all
holders of such debt securities will be established whether or not there are different issuances and of the governing law of
those obligations (the “Bondholders’ General Meeting”). The Notes constitute obligations for the purposes of safeguard
proceedings.

As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee or general meeting.
Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the committee or general
meeting.

It is unclear whether the Security Agent as creditor of the Parallel Debt under the Intercreditor Agreement would vote in
the creditor’s committee. The proposed plan:

� must take into account subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the commencement of the
proceedings;


-----

� may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and

� may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting
from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien- see below), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps
requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital increase by way of a
set-off with their claims against the debtor, as reduced as the case may be according to the provisions of the plan.

Creditors which are members of the credit institutions’ committee or the suppliers’ committee may also prepare an
alternative safeguard or reorganization plan that will also be put to the vote of the committees and of the general
bondholders meeting, it being specified that approval of these alternative plans is subject to the same two-thirds majority
vote in each committee and in the Bondholders General Meeting and gives rise to a report by the judicial administrator.
Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan.

Each creditor member of a creditors committee and each holder of the Notes must, if applicable, inform the judicial
administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to the exercise of its vote, to the full or total payment of its claim
by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The judicial administrator shall then submit to the creditor/holder
of the Notes a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors committee/Bondholders General Meeting.
In the event of a disagreement, the creditor/holder of the Notes or the judicial administrator may request that the matter be
decided by the President of the commercial court in summary proceedings (en référé). The amounts of claims secured by
a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights.

The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within a minimum of 15 days of its submission. The plan must
be approved by a majority vote of each committee, provided that the majority is two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the
creditors expressing a vote.

In addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a payment
of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, are not consulted and
do not vote. Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval
to the Bondholders’ General Meeting at the same two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the bondholders expressing a
vote.

Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the Bondholders’ General Meeting and determination of a
rescheduling of the claim of creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders as discussed hereafter, the
plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the court. In considering such approval, the court has to verify that the interests of all
creditors are sufficiently protected and that relevant shareholder consent, if any is required, has been obtained. Once
approved by the court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders
(including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan).

In the event that the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the Bondholders’ General Meeting
within the first six months of the observation period, either because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject it,
this six month period may be extended by the court at the request of the judicial administrator, to the extent it does not
exceed the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved by the committee-based consultation
process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan in the time remaining until the end of the
observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation process
described above.

If the court empowers the administrator to convene a shareholders’ meeting to take corporate resolutions with respect to
the modification of the debtor’s share capital required by a safeguard plan, the court may order that, under certain
conditions, the shareholders’ decisions be adopted by a majority vote of the shareholders attending or represented, as long
as such shareholders own at least half of the shares with voting rights.


-----

If no plan is adopted by the committees, at the request of the debtor, the judicial administrator, the mandataire judiciaire
or the public prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it
appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead
to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent.

_Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions:_ Public creditors (financial administrations, social security and
unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that are similar to those that
would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public
creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security
interests. Public creditors are consulted under specific conditions, within the framework of a local administrative committee
(Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards
indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

In the event that safeguard (or judicial reorganization) proceedings are commenced against any of the Issuers, the holders
of the Notes will not be members of the credit institutions’ committee but would vote on any proposed draft safeguard plan
as members of the Bondholders’ General Meeting.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard and Accelerated Financial Safeguard_**

A debtor in conciliation proceedings which reach a conciliation agreement (supported by the majority but not all of its
creditors) may request commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée), allowing a restructuring plan
to be rapidly approved by the two-thirds vote of the creditors’ committees and bondholders’ general meeting applicable in
safeguard proceedings.

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed to “fast-track”
difficulties of large companies:

� who publish consolidated accounts in accordance with article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code; or

� who publish accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant and have
either (i) more than 20 employees or (ii) a turnover greater than €3.0 million excluding applicable taxes, or (iii)
whose total balance sheet assets exceeds €1.5 million.

If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require creditors’ committees (see above) to be constituted, the court must
authorize such constitution in the opening decision in order for the debtor to be eligible to accelerated safeguard or
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

The regime applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is broadly the regime
applicable to standard safeguard proceedings to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing in accelerated safeguard
and/or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, since the total duration of the accelerated safeguard proceedings is
three months, while the duration of the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is one month, unless the court decides
to extend it by an additional month.

In particular, the creditors’ committees and the Bondholders’ General Meeting are required to vote on the proposed
safeguard plan within a minimum period of fifteen days of its being sent to the creditors in the case of accelerated safeguard
proceedings or within 8 days thereof in accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in
accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

The plan adopted in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is
adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling,
debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital in the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant


-----

shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not
belong to one of the committees or are not bondholders.

The accelerated financial safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e. creditors that belong to the credit
institutions committee and bondholders), the payment of whose debt is suspended until adoption of a plan through the
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. As to financial creditors, the debtor will be prohibited from paying any
amounts (including interests) in connection with the finance documents that fall due during the observation period. Such
amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms.
Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are
not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in
the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfill
three conditions:

� the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the opening of accelerated
safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings;

� the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially requested the opening of
conciliation;

� as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a position to
overcome; and

� the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of his business as a going concern
supported by enough of its creditors subject to the proceedings members of, as applicable, its credit institutions
or major suppliers committee or its Bondholders’ General Meeting, to render likely its adoption by a two-thirds
majority of the relevant Committee and General Meeting within a maximum of three months following the
commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings and of one month following the commencement of
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (that can be extended by an additional month).

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the deadlines applicable to each, the court shall
terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee process.

The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceeding shall be drawn up by the debtor and certified by the
statutory auditor and shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of the accelerated safeguard
proceedings or, as applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect
to make such a filing (see below).

**_Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) may be initiated
against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent (en cessation des paiements) and, for liquidation proceedings only, if the
debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation
proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming insolvent. De jure managers
(including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers are exposed to civil liability if it fails to do so.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court considers that judicial
liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, after having heard the debtor, the court may order the commencement
of the proceedings which it finds most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of
judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considers that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate.

In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’
representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor or (at its own initiative) the court may convert judicial


-----

reorganization proceedings into liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. In
all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors’
representative, the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment
and the payment of creditors, in that order.

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital
of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

Under the judicial reorganization proceedings, the administrator appointed by the court will assist the debtor to make
management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control
of the debtor (mission d’administration). As a result of the commencement of liquidation proceedings, the managers of the
debtor are no longer in charge of the management.

In the event of judicial reorganization, an administrator is usually appointed by the court (administrateur judiciaire) to
investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals
either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a reorganization plan, which is similar to a
safeguard plan), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor.

Committees of creditors and a Bondholders General Meeting may be created under the same conditions as in safeguard
proceedings (see above). At any time during this observation period, the court can order the liquidation of the debtor. At
the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization
plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of
the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business described below.

In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning
of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of the
company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment (iii) the modification
of the company's share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and
to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator
or of the State prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least 3
months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings
required to approve the modification of the company's share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have
refused such modification, the insolvency court may either:

� appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital
increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization
plan; or

� order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of
the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or
indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result
of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company's shareholder meetings, any
consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and
request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees.

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, isdetermined
by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold
their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the


-----

court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former
creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor
does the law limit their duration. The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation
operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are
sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order for payment). The liquidator will take over the management and
control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes of such liquidation scenario:

� an asset sale plan (in which case the court will usually appoint a judicial administrator to manage the debtor and
organize such sale of the business); or

� a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

� launch auction sales;

� sell on an amicable basis each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received, (the
formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the
bidder); or

� request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, from all potential interested purchasers to bid on
each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their
offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure
_des plis cachetés)._

In reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity to a level
equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by article L.626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the
administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire en justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of
the shareholders which refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification
of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the recovery plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization
plan is proposed, the court upon the request of the administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of the business.

When either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or
continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif), the court
terminates the proceedings. The court may also terminate such proceedings when the interest of the continuation of the
liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets. The court may also appoint a
_mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the_
remaining creditors.

**_The Hardening Period (période suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings_**

The date of insolvency (date de cessation des paiements) is deemed to be the date of the court order commencing
proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18 months before the date of such court
order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the date of insolvency may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final
court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The date
of insolvency is important because it marks the beginning of the “période suspecte” (otherwise referred to as “hardening
period”), being the period between the date of insolvency and the court decision commencing the proceedings. Certain
transactions entered into during the hardening period are void as of right or voidable by the court.

Void and Voidable Transactions


-----

Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may
constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. Such transactions or
payments must be set aside by the court if a claimant (such as an insolvency officer or the public prosecutor) so requests.
These include, notably, transfers of assets for no or nominal consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal obligations
of the debtor significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments
made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments
ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with
article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security granted for debts (including a security granted to secure a guarantee
obligation) previously incurred and provisional measures (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency),
operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer
is made as security for debt incurred simultaneously), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or
rights already transferred in the trust as a guarantee of debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations
of non-seizability (déclaration d’insaisissabilité).

Transactions voidable by the court include payments made on accrued debts, transactions for consideration and notices of
attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the
hardening period, in each case if the court determines that the creditor knew of the insolvency of the debtor. Transactions
relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure
(déclaration d'insaisissabilité) pursuant to article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered
into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. Unlike with respect to void transactions,
which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it appropriate to set
aside transactions that are only “voidable.”

**_Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, Judicial_**
**_Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the safeguard or insolvency proceedings triggers (or gives
creditors the right to trigger) the acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which
the court does not order the continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract
are not enforceable against the debtor. Neither, in accordance with a decision of the French supreme court (cour de
_cassation) dated January 14, 2014, n°12-22.909, are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of_
an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of
reorganization proceedings” (case law which is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed officer can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing
contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform.

Conversely, the court-appointed officer can, require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations
even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-petition
contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of reorganization proceedings, absent consent to other terms of
payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically
accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with
a view to the adoption of a “plan for the sale of the business” (plan de cession) (which it may do for a period of three
months, renewable once), in which case the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision
adopting the “plan for the sale of the business” or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

� accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing
for a payment which is deferred by at least one year, with respect to which, however, accrued interest can no
longer be compounded;

� the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to
specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by


-----

the insolvency judge appointed by the court to recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued
operation of the business);

� the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after commencement of the proceedings unless they are
incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/
goods provided to the debtor;

� creditors (only financial creditors in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) may not initiate or
pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is
a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard ) with
respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal
action is:

� to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor
may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below);

� to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or

� to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except (i) in judicial liquidation
proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of
the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset, whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, is
located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors
thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 8
EU Insolvency Regulation; or

� immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrats en cours), absent consent
to other terms of payment, will be required only in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings.

A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan ("plan de
_sauvegarde") adopted by the Court but not of the provisions of a judicial reorganization plan ("plan de redressement")._

In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that
are subject to the accelerated safeguard proceedings or the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings respectively (see
above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of proceedings must file a
claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in an
official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors
domiciled outside France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect
to which the two or four month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Where the debtor has
informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim and no proof of claim has been filed yet, the claim as
reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing on the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the debtor.
Creditors are allowed to ratify a proof of claim made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility
of the claim. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period, whose claims are not deemed filed
with the creditors’ representative are, except with respect to limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made
in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferential creditors under
French law.

In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however:

� debts owed to creditors other than banks, financial institutions or bondholders should be paid in the ordinary
course; and


-----

� the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having participated in the conciliation proceedings, which is
certified by its statutory auditors (failing which, its accountant).

Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this
simplified alternative and merely adjust the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within
the above two or four months’ time limit). Those financial creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceedings
(but who would belong to the financial institutions’ committee or the Bondholders’ General Meeting) would have to file
their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or reorganization plan,
claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. The court can also set a time period
during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continued business of the debtor may not be sold without its
consent.

If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial
liquidation proceedings, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the
ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator
(usually the former creditor’s representative) in charge of managing the debtor, selling the assets of the debtor and settling
the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. However, in practice, where the sale of the business is considered, the
court will usually appoint a judicial administrator to manage the debtor during the temporary continuation of the business
operations (see above) and organize the sale of the business process.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, post-petition
legal costs (essentially, fees of the officials appointed by the court), creditors who, as part of the approved conciliation
agreement, have provided new money or goods or services, creditors who benefit from the S/R Lien, post-petition creditors,
certain pre-petition secured creditors in the event of liquidation proceedings and the French State (taxes and social charges).
In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured
by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all
creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim
related to such asset.

As soon as insolvency proceedings are commenced, the immediate payment of any unpaid amount of share capital of the
debtor will be required.

The mandataire judiciaire may demand that a shareholder pay-up its portion of the unpaid share capital.

_Creditors’ Liability_

Pursuant to article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code as interpreted by case law, where safeguard, judicial
reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may be held liable for the losses
suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor only if the granting of such facilities was wrongful and, in the case of
(i) fraud; (ii) interference with the management of the debtor or (iii) if the security or guarantees taken to support the
facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect
of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court.

**_Exceptional measures related to COVID-19 Epidemic_**

In the context of COVID-19 epidemic and the state of health emergency and lock-down measures that have been imposed
in France, it should be noted that recourse to court-assisted proceedings and court-administered proceedings has been more
difficult during the lock-down period. Therefore, ordinance n°2020-596 of March 27, 2020, ordinance n°2020-341 of May
20, 2020 (as modified by article 124 of French law n°2020-1525 of December 7, 2020) and ordinance n°2020-1443 of
November 25, 2020 (together, the “French COVID Insolvency Ordinances”) temporarily adapt the procedures for
dealing with businesses which are facing difficulties to take account of the conditions under which they are implemented
during the sanitary emergency (état d’urgence sanitaire) and in the months following its cessation. In particular, it


-----

encourages the use of court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc and conciliation) and lengthens the timeframe for courtadministered proceedings. The provisions of these ordinances are applicable until December 31, 2020, July 17, 2021 or
December 31, 2021, as the case may be.

_Enhanced information of the president of the commercial court for the prevention of company difficulties_

Under the early warning procedure (procedure d’alerte) provided for in articles L. 234-1, L. 234-2 and L. 612-3 of the
French Commercial Code, the statutory auditors have the option, after having informed the legal representative of the
company of events likely to compromise the going concern, of notifying the president of the competent court of the
inadequacy or lack of measures taken by the legal representative. The purpose of this measure is to provide the president
of the court as early as possible and as promptly as possible, with information relating to the difficulties encountered by a
company. These provisions are applicable until and including December 31, 2021. Enhanced information of the president
of the commercial court for the prevention of company difficulties

Under the early warning procedure (procedure d’alerte) provided for in articles L. 234-1, L. 234-2 and L. 612-3 of the
French Commercial Code, the statutory auditors have the option, after having informed the legal representative of the
company of events likely to compromise the going concern, of notifying the president of the competent court of the
inadequacy or lack of measures taken by the legal representative. The purpose of this measure is to provide the president
of the court as early as possible and as promptly as possible, with information relating to the difficulties encountered by a
company. These provisions are applicable until and including December 31, 2021.

_Enhanced effectiveness of conciliation proceedings_

The French COVID Insolvency Ordinances implement measures aimed at considerably enhancing the efficiency of
conciliation proceedings.

The duration of conciliation proceedings can be increased, at the request of the conciliator, once or several times, provided
that the maximum duration of conciliation proceedings shall not exceed 10 months (instead of four months, extendable
once for an additional period of 1 month, previously).

Until December 31, 2021, if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the
conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the debtor in conciliation may
apply to the president of the court which ordered the commencement of the procedure, in ex parte proceedings, for the
duration of the conciliation proceedings:

� to stay or prohibit any legal action by a creditor with a view to order the debtor to pay a sum of money or to
terminate a contract for non-payment of a sum of money;

� to stay or prohibit any enforcement proceedings by a creditor on both movable and immovable property, as well
as any distribution proceedings which have not become fully effective prior to the application; and

� to defer or reschedule creditors’ claims which are due and payable.

� These measures may be combined with the request for grace periods under Articles 1343-5 of the French Civil
Codes, as already provided for in article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code (see “—France—Insolvency—
_Grace Periods” above). Even before the creditor sends any notice to pay or initiates any suit for payment if a_
creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend
payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation.

� These new provisions allow the implementation of a hybrid conciliation procedure, the effects of which are similar
to those of safeguard proceedings but without the disadvantages. These provisions are applicable to ongoing
proceedings and until and including December 31, 2021.

� _Provisions aimed at facilitating the use of accelerated proceedings_


-----

� The use of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) and accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée) is facilitated, by removing the threshold
conditions provided for in article L. 628-1 of the French Commercial Code relating to the employees and turnover
thresholds for the safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) and the financial safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée).

� If the accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or financial safeguard proceedings
(procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée) fail and no plan is drawn up within the period provided for in the
first paragraph of article L. 628-8 of the French Commercial Code, the court may immediately, at the request of
the debtor, the judicial administrator (administrateur judiciaire), the creditors’ representative (mandataire
_judiciaire) or the public prosecutor (ministere public), open separate judicial reorganization (procédure de_
_redressement) or liquidation proceedings (procédure de liquidation judiciaire). The aim is to make these pre-pack_
proceedings available to as many companies as possible. These provisions are applicable to proceedings initiated
between May 21, 2020 until the earlier of July 17, 2021 (inclusive) and the date of entry into force of the upcoming
ordinance that will transpose under French law the requirements of EU Directive 2019/1023 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 (i.e., the insolvency proceedings harmonization directive).

� Provisions to facilitate the adoption of a safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) or a judicial reorganization plan
(plan _de redressement)_

The adoption of a safeguard or judicial reorganization plan is facilitated and accelerated by:

� shortening the timelines for consulting creditors to 15 days in the event of the presentation of a draft plan at the
request of the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the judicial administrator (administrateur
_judiciaire), with the authorization of the insolvency judge (juge commissaire);_

� a reduction in the formalities for consulting creditors: proposals for the settlement of debts as well as any responses
to these proposals may be communicated by any means enabling the creditors’ representative (mandataire
_judiciaire) to establish with certainty the date of their receipt;_

� the finalization of the plan exceptionally based on outstanding liabilities estimated on the basis of a certificate
from the chartered-accountant (expert-comptable) or statutory auditor, on admitted, uncontested and identifiable
claims (those for which the deadline for filing has not expired).

� These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings up to and including December 31, 2021.

_Provisions aimed at facilitating the implementation of a safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) and a judicial reorganization_
_plan (plan de redressement)_

The Ordinance dated May 20, 2020 provides for provisions to facilitate the implementation of safeguard and judicial
reorganization plans by:

� increasing by a maximum of two years the duration of the execution of the safeguard or judicial reorganization
plans (i.e. a maximum duration of 12 years or 17 years in the agricultural sector);

� deeming failure to reply from creditors consulted for the adoption or modification of the plan to be acceptance of
the proposed new payment terms;

introducing a post-money lien (a new “safeguard or judicial reorganization” privilege similar to the “new money”
privilege, the “S/R Lien”), for persons who make a new cash contribution to the debtor either during the
observation period, or within the framework of the safeguard or judicial reorganization plan (these new
contributions will be mentioned in the judgment which adopts or modifies the plan). Creditors benefiting from
this safeguard or judicial reorganization privilege are paid, for the amount of their contribution, in the order
provided for in III of article L. 622-17 and III of article L. 641-13 of the French Commercial Code, i.e., after wage


-----

claims. Contributions granted by the shareholders and partners of the debtor in the context of a capital increase
are excluded from the safeguard or judicial reorganization privilege. Such claims may not termed-out or writtenoff without the consent of the relevant creditors.

These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings and until and including December 31, 2021, with the exception of
the provisions on the safeguard privilege applicable as from May 21, 2020 and at the latest until and including December
31, 2021.

_Provisions to facilitate the sale of the business_

Adjustments relating to the sale of the business have been provided and in particular, a reduction in the notice period
required to convene the contracting parties provided for in article R. 642-7 of the French Commercial Code from 15 to 8
days in the event of a plan for the sale of the business (this notice period may however be modified by decree pursuant to
article 10 of ordinance dated May 20, 2020).

These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings and until and including December 31, 2020.

_Provisions aimed at facilitating recovery of the company_

The period at the end of which the mention in the trade and company registry of safeguard and judicial reorganization
proceedings is deleted from the register if the plan is still in progress is reduced to one year (this period may however be
modified by decree pursuant to article 10 of ordinance dated May 20, 2020). These provisions are applicable to ongoing
proceedings and until and including July 17, 2021 at the latest.

_Limitations on Guarantees_

The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to:

� certain exceptions, including to the extent any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute prohibited financial
assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code or would constitute a misuse
of corporate assets within the meaning of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code,
it being specified that, under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing
indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition; and

� a contractual financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the Offering of the Notes
(including any additional Notes) which the Issuers have (i) applied for the direct or indirect benefit of each French
Guarantor and/or the controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor through the intercompany loans, cash
pooling arrangements or similar arrangements that are outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made
by such French Guarantor or (ii) used to refinance (directly or indirectly) any indebtedness previously on-lent
directly or indirectly to a French Guarantor or its controlled subsidiaries through the intercompany loans or similar
arrangements and that are, in each case, outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French
Guarantor.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could subordinate or void any guarantee or security and, if payment had
already been made under the relevant guarantee or security, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant
guarantor or security provider, if the court found that the guarantor or security provider did not derive an overall corporate
benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee or security as a whole. The existence of a real and adequate
corporate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are
matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, the Guarantees by the French Guarantors are limited to amounts recoverable thereunder that represent either
(i) the amount of debt made available directly or indirectly to that French Guarantor or its subsidiaries with the proceeds
of Indebtedness previously incurred by a holding company of such French Guarantor to the extent that such Indebtedness
is or has been refinanced directly or indirectly with the proceeds of Indebtedness of the Issuers constituting Secured


-----

Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), which term includes the Notes offered hereby (See “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—The Guarantees” and “Description of the Senior Notes—The Guarantees”); and (ii) the amounts_
of the Notes proceeds on-lent, directly or indirectly, to such French Guarantor, and the controlled subsidiaries of that French
Guarantor, through the intercompany loans, via the Group’s cash-pooling arrangements or otherwise, and in each case,
outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee. Any
payment made by such French Guarantor under its guarantee or under the intercompany loans or the cash pooling
arrangements will reduce the maximum amount of its guarantee.

The amount secured by any Collateral which is granted by any such French Guarantor (or any other guarantor which is
incorporated in France) will likewise be limited by the amount which it is so able to guarantee.

By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts
payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee.
See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—The Guarantees” and “Description of the Senior Notes—The Guarantees”.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the
economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s-length basis, the difference
between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain
circumstances.

_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral_

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through
certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on the Collateral securing the
Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take
the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security
Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the
securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist
of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are
registered. The securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration
_de nantissement de compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of_
pledge will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre
_de mouvement de titres) of each French Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are_
not publicly registered (such as pledges over securities account), with the result that no assurance can be given on the
priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered.

_Limitation on Enforcement of Security Interests_

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations and may only be enforced following a
payment default (including following acceleration) and up to the secured amount that is due and remaining unpaid.

Under French law, generally speaking, pledges over assets may be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i)
before a court (a) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the
secured creditors) or (b) by way of the judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets; or (ii) by way of
contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which the secured
creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets.

If the secured creditors choose enforcement by way of foreclosure (whether judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure),
the secured liabilities will be deemed extinguished up to the value of the attributed assets. Such value is determined either
by the judge in the context of a judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or by an expert (pre-contractually agreed or
appointed by a judge) in the context of a contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire). In case of enforcement by way of
foreclosure (whether judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), if the value of the pledged assets exceeds the amount
of the secured liabilities, the secured creditors will be required to pay the relevant pledgor a cash amount (“soulte”) equal
to the difference between the value of the pledged assets as so determined and the amount of the secured liabilities. This is


-----

true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the
Collateral. On the contrary, if the value of such pledged assets is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant
amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such pledged assets, and the
remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could also be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable
law. Since such public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern, however, it is
possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of our group as a going concern.

In addition, in view of the area of activity of the Group or certain members of the Group, it should be noted that foreign
investments in companies or businesses which operate in certain sectors (notably where their activities relate to equipment,
products or services which are critical to the interests of France in terms of public order, public safety or national security,
in particular in the areas of public health, energy and water supply, public transport and electronic communication) may
require the prior authorization of the French authorities. This requirement may interfere with the enforcement of the
Collateral consisting of shares or a business.

Where any of the above sectors are involved, the following shall constitute foreign investments which are subject to the
prior authorization procedure:

A transaction as a result of which a non-EU investor (i) acquires control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the
French Commercial Code), (ii) acquires all or part of a business activity (branche d’activité) or (iii) crosses, directly or
indirectly, whether acting alone or in concert, the threshold of 25% of the voting rights, in each case of an entity governed
by French law.

A transaction as a result of which an EU investor (i) acquires control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French
Commercial Code) or (ii) acquires all or part of a business activity, in either case of an entity governed by French law.

A transaction as a result of which a French investor under non-French control, or a French ultimate investor with a foreign
investor within its chain of control, acquires all or part of a business of an entity governed by French law and which is
active in a strategic sector.

When a foreign investment is subject to the authorization of the French authorities as above, the transaction cannot be
completed prior to authorization. The foreign investor must submit a formal application for prior authorization to the French
authorities, which shall render a decision within a period of 30 business- days of receipt of the application, followed by a
second 45-business-day period if further examination is deemed necessary. In the absence of answer at the end of the said
period, the authorization request will be deemed rejected.

_Security Agent_

Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code allow the creation of security interests and personal guarantees for
the direct benefit of a security agent, which will hold such rights separately from its own estate. As a result, the rights of
secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees will be ring fenced if the security agent is the subject of
insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in cases of the exercise of a right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor).
The security agent will remain liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties. The
security agent can take all legal actions to protect the secured creditor’s interests and file a receivable on behalf of one or
several creditors in a debtor’s insolvency proceeding. The security agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement
specifying its quality, its duties, the duration of its duties and its powers.

_Parallel Debt_

Under French law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the creditor be the
same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of the creditors by third parties who do not hold the secured
claim, unless they act as trustees (fiduciaires) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des
_sûretés) under Article 2488-6 of the French Civil Code, (which will be the case here for the Security Documents governed_


-----

by French law). The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In
order to permit the holders of the Notes to benefit indirectly from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations
of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all
times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the
Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall
discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to such Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder
of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not
directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the
Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent
(even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). Although the French
supreme court (Cour de cassation) has held (in a decision dated September 13, 2011 (Cass. Com. 13 September 2011 n°
10-25.533 Belvédère) rendered in the context of safeguard proceedings opened in France) that, subject to certain conditions
being met, the concept of “parallel debt” governed by the laws of the State of New York was not incompatible with the
French law concept of international public policy (ordre public international), this decision cannot be considered as a
general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt obligation
and no assurance can be given that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. There is no certainty
that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent
that the Security Interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt structure are successfully challenged by other
parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the Collateral.

Further, under a parallel debt structure, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency
or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

_Trustee_

Pledges governed by French law will be granted to the benefit of the Trustee as trustee for the holders of the Notes in
accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture, and may therefore
not directly be granted to holders of the Notes. A concept of “trust” has been recognized for tax purposes by Article 792-0
_bis of the French Tax Code and the French supreme court (Cour de cassation) has held, in the Belvédère decision referred_
to above in respect of the parallel debt concept, that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the
State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in France. However, while
substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the La Haye Convention of July 1, 1985 on the
law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under
French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Trustee are successfully
challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an
enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated
with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee

_Recognition of Validity of Second or Lower Ranking Financial Securities Account Pledges by French courts_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second or lower ranking pledges
over financial securities accounts.

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over the relevant
securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such company are registered. In
France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over securities accounts
(nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a
securities account in which the shares of such a company are registered.

Moreover, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the securities account from the
possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a second or lower ranking pledge thereon. The


-----

second or lower ranking pledge over the shares of such a company will therefore provide that the possession of the securities
account is transferred to the custody of an agreed third party as “tiers convenus” (entiercement), that the first ranking and
second or lower ranking secured parties have consented to the creation of second or lower ranking pledge and that the first
ranking secured parties have accepted their appointment as tiers convenus and hold the pledged securities as custodian for
the benefit of both the first ranking and the second or lower ranking secured parties. To our knowledge, French courts have
never expressly recognized the concept of second (or lower) ranking pledge in respect of a financial securities account and,
if article 2340 of the French Civil Code does recognise the possibility to create multiple pledges in respect of the same
tangible asset, this article is not expressly stated to apply to pledges over financial securities account, and consequently, no
assurances can be given that such second or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is a risk that
the second or lower ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively
registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially adversely affect the recovery
under the Notes or Guarantees (as applicable) following an enforcement event.

_Assumptions as to the Enforceability of Second Ranking Pledges Over Receivables/Bank Accounts_

The pledges over receivables/bank accounts are governed by French law. In France, no lien searches are available for
security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over receivables/bank accounts. As a result, no assurance can
be given on the priority of the pledges over the receivables/bank accounts of a company.

Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over receivables/bank accounts from granting a
second ranking pledge over the same receivables/bank accounts, this structure has not been tested before the French courts
and no assurances can be given that such second ranking pledges would be upheld if tested.

_Fraudulent Conveyance_

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside insolvency proceedings,
the “action paulienne” provisions. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of
recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such person
guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such
person’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other
legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant person by the
creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (commissaire à
_l’exécution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside_
insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or
outside insolvency proceedings, and may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the person performed such
acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s insolvency proceedings, any
creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed
both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such person’s
creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no
consideration (à titre gratuit), in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge
on the grounds of fraudulent conveyance. If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the Security Interests
in the Collateral, or the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under
applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the Security Interests in the Collateral or the granting of such
guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged
the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the
benefit of the Notes, the Guarantees or the Security Interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders
of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, the Security Interests in the Collateral or the Guarantees could also be
subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such
circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuers or
the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

_Assumptions as to the Validity of the Intercreditor Agreement_


-----

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French supreme court (Cour de cassation)
on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor Agreement, except for article
L.626-30-2 of the French Commercial Code which states that, in the context of safeguard proceedings, the safeguard plan
which is put to the committees of creditors takes into consideration (prend en compte) the provisions of subordination
agreements between creditors which were entered into prior to the opening of the safeguard proceedings. As a consequence,
except to the extent referred to above (which, as at the date of this offering memorandum, has received no judicial
interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement

**Belgium**

**_Insolvency_**

Some Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Belgium (the “Belgian Guarantors”). To the extent any Belgian
Guarantor has its registered seat in Belgium or to the extent that Belgium is the territory in which the center of a Belgian
Guarantor’s main interests is situated, main insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium. This also applies to any
debtor for which Belgium is the territory in which the center of such debtor’s main interests is situated. Such proceedings
would then be governed by Belgian law. Under certain circumstances, the Insolvency Regulation and Belgian law also
allows territorial bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets of companies whose center of main
interests is not situated in Belgium. The effects of those territorial bankruptcy proceedings are restricted to the assets
situated in Belgium

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the Belgian insolvency law of August 11, 2017 (as incorporated
in Book XX (“Insolvency of Undertakings”) of the Belgian Code of Economic Law, hereafter the “Belgian Insolvency
**Law”). The Belgian Insolvency Law provides for two insolvency proceedings: judicial reorganization proceedings**
(gerechtelijke reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy proceedings (faillissement/faillite). Note that in
addition, Belgian law allows for liquidation in deficit (deficitaire vereffening/liquidation déficitaire). The latter proceedings
will not be further discussed.

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, a legislative proposal has been approved by Belgium’s House of Representatives
which re-introduces a temporary stay or “moratorium” on enforcement and insolvency proceedings. The moratorium
applies from December 24, 2020 up until (and including) January 31, 2021 (with a possible extension through Royal Decree
in the future) to all enterprises subject to the closure measures imposed by the Ministerial Decree of October 28, 2020
containing urgent measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, amended by the Ministerial Decree of November 1, 2020,
whose continuity is threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic and which were not in a state of cessation of payments before
18 March 2020. The moratorium includes measures such as (i) a temporary stay of bankruptcy proceedings, judicial
winding up, and forced transfer under judicial supervision of whole or part of a company's activities (ii) protection of new
credit provided during the moratorium against the hardening period in subsequent bankruptcy proceedings (iii) a temporary
stay of conservatory or executory attachments and means of enforcement for, in principle, all new and old debts of the
company, both principal amounts and accrued interests, with exceptions for immovable property and seagoing and inland
vessels (iv) a temporary stay of dissolution of agreements on grounds of non-payment of a monetary debt that is due and
payable, with exceptions for employment contracts; and (v) an extension of the payment periods included in a homologated
judicial reorganisation plan for a period equal to the duration of the temporary moratorium.

_Judicial reorganization_

A debtor may (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor) file a petition
for judicial reorganization if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately or in the future. If the net assets
of the company have fallen under 50% of the company’s registered capital, the continuity of the enterprise is presumed to
be at risk. A state of bankruptcy of the debtor does not exclude that a petition for judicial reorganization is filed.

As from the filing of the petition with the competent commercial court overseeing the judicial reorganization and for as
long as such court has not issued a judgment thereon, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt (save in case the debtor files
a declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court order. Furthermore, during this period, with limited exceptions,


-----

none of the debtor’s assets may be realized by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests
that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets. The filing of the petition does not, however, have a suspensory
effect if the debtor requested the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings less than six months ago (unless the court
decides otherwise).

Within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the court will examine such petition, and within 8 days
following such examination and subject to the satisfaction of the filing conditions, the court may decide to open the judicial
reorganization procedure, thereby, granting a temporary moratorium to the debtor for a period of maximum six months. At
the request of the debtor (or of the judicial administrator in case of a procedure of transfer under judicial authority) and
pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended (once or several
times) up to a total maximum period of twelve months as from the judgment opening the judicial reorganization. In
exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure
on employment), and in the interest of the creditors, the court may order an additional extension of the moratorium period
for six months. Special rules apply when a debtor has already requested and obtained a judicial reorganization procedure
in the last 3 years before the new request.

The granting of the temporary moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to pre-existing claims
(i.e. for debts incurred before the judgment opening the judicial reorganization proceedings) in the moratorium can be
continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s moveable and immovable assets from the time that the moratorium is
granted until the end of the period, with limited exceptions. During the moratorium, no attachments can be made with
regard to pre-existing claims. During the moratorium, the debtor can also not be declared bankrupt, except upon declaration
of the debtor itself and, if the debtor is a legal entity, judicial dissolution will not be possible during this period.

Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their conservatory character,
but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect on the situation of
the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of moveable or immoveable property has already been set, such sale
may, under certain conditions, be continued.

If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization proceedings,
such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium (provided the receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from
the moment the pledge is created) (note that a pledge of a business or other universality including receivables is not
considered as a pledge specifically with respect to receivables), and the holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to
take enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (e.g., the debtor’s customers) during
the moratorium. A pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Law of December
15, 2004, as amended (Wet Financiële Zekerheden/Loi sur les Sûretés Financières) (the “Belgian Financial Collateral
**Law”) can be enforced notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, subject to limited**
exceptions. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the
enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co debtors, subject to certain exceptions
or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary
payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of
the enterprise. However, in respect of an enforcement over pledged cash falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial
Collateral Law, the enforcement prohibition applies, with limited exceptions (notably in the event of a payment default),
if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the
meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Law or (ii) a public or financial legal entity but the creditor is not such an
entity.

During judicial reorganization proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor continue to exercise their
management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. However, upon request of the debtor, the court
may appoint, a company mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/médiateur d’entreprise) to assist the debtor during the
moratorium and to facilitate the reorganization of the company or of all or part of its assets or activities. The court may
also appoint a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice), upon request of any interested party or
the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings of the debtor or any of its corporate bodies threatening
the continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities and provided such measure can preserve such
continuity, to either exercise particular tasks indicated by the court, or to replace the debtor or any of its corporate bodies


-----

for the duration of the moratorium. In addition, in the event of manifestly gross error or manifest bad faith, a court appointed
temporary director (voorlopig bestuurder/administrateur provisoire) may be appointed.

The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the initiation
of the judicial reorganization proceedings does not terminate any contracts, and contractual provisions which provide for
the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure, and
certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Such enforcement
prohibition applies, with a few exceptions, to close-out netting provisions as well, if the judicial reorganization procedure
affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral
Law or (ii) a public or financial legal entity but where the creditor is not such an entity. Moreover, the Belgian Insolvency
Law provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the
reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such default within a 15-day period following the notification of such
default.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract during the
reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and that such default is necessary for the debtor
to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the enterprise or its assets. The exercise
of this right does however not prevent the creditor from suspending in turn the performance of its own obligations. The
creditor can however not terminate the agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the performance of
its own obligations.

_Judicial reorganization by collective agreement, by amicable settlement or by court ordered transfer of enterprise_

Judicial reorganization proceedings may result in an amicable settlement between the debtor and two or more of its
creditors, a collective agreement or a transfer of (part of) its activities.

The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the court and all
parties involved. In the case of an amicable settlement, only the parties to such amicable settlement will be bound by the
terms they have agreed. Such in-court agreement requires unanimity among the creditors concerned. The debtor may
petition the court to grant a grace period in respect of its payment obligations, e.g., in relation to interest payments, pending
the negotiation of the agreement. Once agreement is reached, the court will record it. Such an amicable settlement will
remain enforceable in the event of a later bankruptcy, subject to certain exceptions. The court order confirming the
existence of an amicable settlement will be published, without disclosing the content of the agreement, and its terms will
only be binding upon the creditors that have agreed to it.

In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a reorganization plan during the
reorganization procedure. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest
obligations and the swap of debt into equity (the Belgian Insolvency Law contains certain limitations, primarily in view of
protecting employees of the debtor) and may be based on a differentiated treatment of certain various categories of
liabilities. It must be filed with the electronic registry managed by the Belgian bar association (www.regsol.be) at least 20
days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan. The court needs to
ratify the reorganization plan prior to it taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the creditors
(both in headcount and in value of the claims) and by the court will bind all creditors, including those who voted against it
or did not vote. The reorganization plan can bind creditors who have a contractual lien over specific assets, pledgees,
mortgagees and the so -called creditor-owners, provided that (i) interest is paid on the principal amount of their outstanding
debts, and (ii) their rights are not suspended for more than 24 months as of the ratification of the collective agreement by
the court. No other measures can be imposed on such creditors without their individual agreement. The court may refuse
ratification if the conditions of the judicial reorganization act were not met, or if the proposed reorganization plan violates
public policy.

Within a period of eight days following the judgment opening the judicial reorganization proceedings, the debtor must
inform each of its creditors individually of the amount of its claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the
debtor, as well as of the capacity of the creditor as extraordinary creditor and of details regarding security interests, if
applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can


-----

challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor at the latest one month prior to the day
on which the creditors vote on the reorganization plan. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of
such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure, or definitively, on the condition that it
has jurisdiction in that respect but that the decision relating to the dispute cannot be taken in a sufficiently short time frame.
In addition, the court can at any moment, in the event of absolute necessity and upon the request of the debtor or the
creditor, change its decision determining the amount or the ranking of the claim on the basis of new elements. If a creditor
has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month in advance of the date on which the creditors
will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as
well as for the purposes of the reorganization plan.

The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the assistance of the court
appointed judicial administrator or company mediator, as the case may be. The plan may include measures such as the
reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity and may be based on a
limited (justified) differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities.

The court ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its petition or at a later
stage in the procedure. It may also be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or by any party who has an interest
in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court can order such transfer in specific circumstances.

The court-ordered transfer will be organized by one or more judicial administrators. Following the transfer, the recourse
of the creditors will in most cases be limited to the transfer price.

**_Bankruptcy_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors or upon the initiative of the Public Prosecutor’s
office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets, by the liquidator of the debtor’s assets or by the liquidator of
‘main insolvency proceedings’ opened in another EU member state (other than Denmark) in accordance with the
Insolvency Regulation. Once the court ascertains that the requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a
date by which all creditors’ claims must be submitted to the court for verification.

Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/declaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a situation of
sustained cessation of payments (op duurzame wijze opgehouden hebben te betalen/cessation de paiements de manière
_persistante) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/ébranlement du crédit). Cessation of payments_
is generally considered as the inability of the debtor to pay its debts as they fall due. Such situation must be persistent and
not merely temporary. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the
bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for the
operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors
and the liquidation of the debtor.

In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The
bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for the operation of the business and
implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor.
Subject to what follows, the rights of creditors in the process are in principle limited to being informed of the course of the
bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the bankruptcy receiver. Creditors may oppose to the sale of assets by
bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary continued operation of the business.

The bankruptcy receiver must decide whether or not to temporarily continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e.,
contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor,
provided the bankruptcy receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice
to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply:

� the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early
termination or acceleration event; and


-----

� _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element_
upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is
no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can however agree to continue to perform
under such contracts.

The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party which are still to be performed after
the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the bankruptcy if such decision is
necessary for the management and the liquidation of the bankrupt estate. The counterparty to an ongoing contract may
summon the bankruptcy receiver to take a decision within 15 days. If no extension of the 15 days term is agreed upon or if
the bankruptcy receiver does not take any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration
of the 15 days term. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim
will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract
dissolved. The counterparty may not seek injunctive relief or require specific performance of the contract.

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court order opening
bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy receiver may proceed against the debtor and
liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account,
falling with the scope of the Belgian Financial Collateral Law. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate credits
(boedelschulden / dettes de la masse).

For creditors with claims secured by movable assets (other than financial collateral), such suspension would normally be
limited to the period required for the verification of the claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension
period may be extended for up to one year as from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of
the court which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest of all
creditors without prejudicing the secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been given the
opportunity to be heard by the court. However, a pledge on financial instrument or cash held on accounts can be enforced
during the suspension period.

For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is necessary to pursue
the sale of the assets, subject to certain exceptions. The bankruptcy receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given
either at its request or at the request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the
enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the report of claims has been finalized. The court may suspend such enforcement
for a period of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a realization of the
assets without prejudicing the mortgagee provided that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be heard by the
court.

If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an insolvency proceeding,
are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such security shall, in accordance with the EU
Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such insolvency proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its unsecured debt,
or debts secured by a general privilege, such as tax administration or social security debts.

The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The following is a
general overview of such rules:

� Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the bankruptcy receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the
so-called “estate debts”, have a senior priority. In addition, if the bankruptcy receiver has contributed to the
realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the bankruptcy receiver in priority out of
the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors.

� Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether by
means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization).


-----

� Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (e.g., tax claims, claims for social
security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the debtor. Certain
privileges prevail over the security interests.

� _Pari passu: Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests and privileges have been_
satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the bankruptcy receiver among the unsecured
creditors who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated).

� Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).

**_Limitations on Enforcement of the Notes, the Guarantees and Security Interests_**

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian company for the obligations of another group company must fall within
the grantor’s legal and corporate purpose and be for the own corporate benefit of the granting company.

If the granting of a guarantee or the creation of a security interest does not fall within the grantor’s corporate object, then
such guarantee or security interest could, upon certain conditions, be held null and void. The assessment of whether or not
the grant of a guarantee or security interest is in each of the Belgian guarantor’s own corporate interest, is largely dependent
on factual considerations and is to be determined on a case-by-case basis by the board of directors or director(s) of each of
the Belgian guarantors at the time of the granting of the guarantees, in anticipation of their enforcement and to be reviewed
ultimately on a case-by-case basis at the time of the enforcement by the competent courts. Consideration has to be given
to any direct and/or indirect benefit that such Belgian guarantor would derive from the transaction; this is particularly
relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees and security interests. It is generally considered by legal scholars that at
least the following principles apply to such evaluation: (i) the risk taken by the Belgian guarantor in issuing the guarantee
must be proportional to the direct and/or indirect benefit derived from the transaction; and (ii) the financial support granted
by the Belgian guarantor should not exceed its financial capabilities. The responsibility for such assessment lies with the
board of directors or manager(s) of the Belgian guarantors.

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the board of directors or director(s) of the Belgian guarantor may be held
liable (i) by the company for negligence in the management of the company and (ii) by third parties in tort and under
criminal law in certain specific circumstances, i.e. where the specific facts can be qualified as “abuse of company goods”
(misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de biens sociaux). Moreover, the guarantee or security interest could be
declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor that benefits from the guarantee or security interest
may also be held liable on the basis of the principles of tort liability. Alternatively, the guarantee or security interest could
be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit and, under certain circumstances, the creditor could be
held liable on the basis of the principles of tort liability for any guarantee amount in excess of such amount. These rules
have however seldom been tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee or security interest to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect
parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market practice for
indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to
subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement (or
the accession documents thereto) will contain limitation language on the basis of which the total maximum guarantee
liabilities of certain Belgian guarantors (in case of an upstream or cross stream guarantee) under the Secured Debt
Documents (as described below) will be limited. The limitation language will be substantially as follows:

The liability of any Belgian Obligor under the guarantee provided in relation to the Senior Facilities Agreement and the
guarantee provided in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes for the obligations of any Obligor,
which is not a direct or indirect Subsidiary of that Belgian Obligor, will be limited to the greater of:

(i) an amount equal to 90 per cent. of the Net Assets of that Belgian Obligor calculated on the basis of its latest
available annual financial statements at the date on granting of the guarantee;


-----

(ii) an amount equal to 90 per cent. of the Net Assets of that Belgian Obligor calculated on the basis of its latest
available annual financial statements at the date on which the relevant demand is made against it; and

(iii) the highest amount of On-Lending to the Belgian Obligor and its Subsidiaries at any time between the date of
granting of the guarantee and the date on which the relevant demand is made against it,

it being specified that, the amount resulting from the calculation referred to in paragraphs (i) to (iii) above shall apply
without double counting and on a pro rata basis to both (i) the guarantee provided under the Senior Facilities Agreement
and (ii) the guarantee provided in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes.

For the purpose of this paragraph:

Net Assets means the net assets of the relevant Belgian Obligor as calculated in accordance with the rules under the Belgian
Code of Companies and Associations to determine the amount available for distribution as dividend, and, in the event of a
dispute of the amount thereof, a certificate of such amount from the statutory auditor of the relevant Belgian Obligor (or,
if no statutory auditor is appointed or the statutory auditor refuses to issue such certificate, from an accountant appointed
upon the Agent’s request by the “Instituut van de Bedrijfsrevisoren/Institut des Réviseurs d’Entreprises”) shall be
conclusive, save in the case of manifest error.

On-Lending means, without double counting, the aggregate amount of all Loans made to any Obligor and made available
by any Obligor, directly or indirectly, to the relevant Belgian Obligor or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, irrespective
of whether retained or on-lent by that Belgian Obligor or its Subsidiary).

For the purpose of this section relating to the guarantees that will be granted by the Belgian guarantors, “Secured Debt
Documents” means the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Indentures, and any other related agreement having the benefit of
the Collateral.

The secured liabilities under the Security Documents granted by a Belgian guarantor will be subject to the same limitations.

**_Financial Assistance_**

Any guarantee or security interest granted by a Belgian Guarantor which constitutes a breach of the provisions on financial
assistance as defined by Article 5:152 or 7:227 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations, might not be
enforceable.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event that bankruptcy proceedings are governed by Belgian law, certain transactions may be declared ineffective
against third parties if concluded or performed by the debtor during the so-called “hardening period” (verdachte
_periode/période suspecte)._

In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition for filing for bankruptcy) is deemed to have occurred
as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on serious and objective
indications that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months
before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was
dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud
its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined as being the date of such decision to
dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred to
as the “hardening period”.

The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective against third
parties include, among others, (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions entered into at an undervalue or on extremely
beneficial terms for the counterparty, (ii) payments for debts which are not due (iii) payments other than in cash for debts
due, and (iv) security interests provided for pre-existing debts.


-----

The Belgian bankruptcy receiver may request the court to declare payments of a Belgian Guarantor during the hardening
period for debts due ineffective against third parties provided that it can be proven that the creditor concerned was aware
of the cessation of payment of the company. If the guarantee or security interests granted by a Belgian Guarantor were
successfully held ineffective (based on the above), noteholders would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and would
be under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such guarantee or the realization of the security. Finally,
regardless of any declaration by the commercial court of a hardening period, transactions for which it can be demonstrated
that they have been entered into with fraudulent prejudice to a third creditor, may be declared ineffective against third
parties.

**_Recognition and Enforcement_**

The granting of security interests over movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, assets may be subject to validity
and/or enforceability conditions. The breach of any of such conditions may render such security interests invalid or
unenforceable. The foreclosure of security interests may be subject to formalities (e.g. judicial or non-judicial consent) and
may be time consuming in the event that the foreclosure takes place under judicial control or in the event of a legal dispute.
Courts may condition the enforcement of a security interest and/or guarantee upon the evidence that the creditor has a final
and undisputed claim triggering the foreclosure of the security interest and/or guarantee. Enforcement of security interests
and/or guarantees may be hindered by conflict of law and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and may not breach any public
policy provision and/or mandatory legal provisions. Courts may require a sworn translation in French or Dutch of the
English documents which they may review.

**Plan of Distribution**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) dated the date of this
offering memorandum by and among the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers, we have agreed to sell to each
Initial Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from us, together with all
other Initial Purchasers, the Notes.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes
are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial
offering of the Notes, the offering prices and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial
Purchasers without notice. Sales in the United States may be made through certain affiliates of the Initial Purchasers.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in
accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover
page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be
required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that during the period from the
date hereof through and including the date that is 60 days after the date hereof, we will not, and the Guarantors will not,
without the prior written consent provided for in the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose
of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuers or any of the Guarantors that are substantially similar to the Notes.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act and may not be offered
or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities
Act and outside the United States to persons that are not U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S
under the U.S. Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the
U.S. Securities Act. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions”.

Each Initial Purchaser represents warrants and agrees that it:

� has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated
any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA)
received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the
FSMA does not apply to us or the Guarantors; and

� has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in
relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise
made available to and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any securities to any retail investor in the EEA. For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article
4(1) MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering
or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been or will be prepared and
therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful
under the PRIIPS Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes (i) in any
Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement
to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes and (ii) the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”)


-----

from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of such securities. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for
the purpose of the Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that the Notes are not intended to be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in
the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point
(8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU)
No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required
by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”)
for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been or will be
prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK
may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

Certain Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC and, therefore, may not make sales of any Notes
in the United States or to U.S. persons except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. To the extent that
such Initial Purchasers intend to effect sales of the Notes in the United States, they will do so only through one or more
U.S. registered broker-dealers or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S. law.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold,
distributed or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a
customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the
Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering, selling
or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared
and therefore offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the
EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

Each of the Initial Purchasers has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made
available and will not offer, sell, distribute or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA or in
the UK. For the purposes of this provision:

� the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

� a retail client as defined in point (11) of MiFID II; or

� a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

� not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation; and

� the expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the
terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the
Notes.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial
Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering
memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required.
Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any
other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any
country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction.


-----

This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase Notes in any
jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum
comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of
this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

We and the Guarantors have also agreed that we will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose
of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would
cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbor of Rule 144A and
Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We will apply, through our listing agent, to
list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for
listing or that such listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The
Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be
discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making
activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market
for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular
time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Guarantees”.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover
page of this offering memorandum, which will be ten business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of
the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T +     ”).
Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business
days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes
on the date of this offering memorandum or the following     business days will be required to specify an alternative
settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make
such trades should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the Offering, J.P. Morgan AG (the “Stabilizing Manager”), or persons acting on its behalf, may engage
in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or
persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. The
Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position,
and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing
Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by
applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market
price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in
these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or
trading markets for, the Notes. “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees”.

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates
a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security
so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in
the open market after the distribution has been completed to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchaser
to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased
in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it
would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which
adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various activities,
which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management,
investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers
and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may currently and/or in the future perform, various
financial advisory, investment and corporate banking, commercial lending and banking, consulting and other commercial
services in the ordinary course of business for us and our affiliates, and may have from time to time in the past held, and
may in the future hold, positions in our or any of our affiliates’ securities or enter into hedging or general derivative
transactions with us or our affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they received or will receive customary
fees and commissions and reimbursement of expenses. Certain Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are
lenders under the Existing Senior Facilities and thus may receive a portion of the proceeds from the Offering upon
repayment thereof. In addition, Natixis and/or its respective affiliates is the facility agent and security agent under the
Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and will act as the facility agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement. The Initial
Purchasers and certain of their affiliates are expected to be lenders, arrangers or agent under the Senior Facilities.

Our institutional investors, their respective controlling shareholders, or any of their respective affiliates, directors or officers
may purchase Notes in the offering at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this
offering memorandum on the Issue Date or in the future. The Purchase Agreement will not restrict the ability of our
institutional investors, their respective controlling shareholders or any of their respective affiliates, directors or officers to
buy or sell Notes on the Issue Date or in the future and, as a result, our institutional investors, their respective controlling
shareholders, or any of their respective affiliates, directors or officers may buy or sell the Notes on the Issue Date or in
open market transactions at any time following the consummation of the offering of the Notes.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or
hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and
securities activities may involve our or our affiliates’ securities and/or instruments (directly, as collateral securing other
obligations or otherwise). The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations
and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and at any time may hold,
or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

If any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us or our affiliates, certain of those Initial
Purchasers or their affiliates may routinely hedge their credit exposure to our or our affiliates in a manner consistent with
their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure
by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions
in our or our affiliates’ securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short
positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby.

**Available Information**

Each purchaser of the Notes from the Initial Purchasers will be furnished with a copy of this offering memorandum and,
to the extent provided to the Initial Purchasers by us for such purpose, any related amendment or supplement to this offering
memorandum. Each person receiving this offering memorandum acknowledges that:

� such person has been afforded an opportunity to request from us and to review, and has received, all additional
information considered by it to be necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information herein;

� such person has not relied on any of the Initial Purchasers or any person affiliated with any Initial Purchaser in
connection with its investigation of the accuracy of such information or its investment decision; and

� except as provided pursuant to (i) above, no person has been authorized to give any information or to make any
representation concerning the Notes or the Guarantees offered hereby other than those contained herein and, if
given or made, such other information or representation should not be relied upon as having been authorized by
us or any Initial Purchaser.

For so long as the Notes remain outstanding and are “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the
U.S. Securities Act, we will, during any period in which we are neither subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange
Act, nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) of the U.S. Exchange Act, upon written request of a holder or
beneficial owner of the Notes, furnish to such holder or beneficial owner or to the Trustees or any relevant paying agent
for delivery to such holder or beneficial owner or prospective purchaser of the Notes, as the case may be, the information
required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act, to permit compliance with Rule 144A
thereunder in connection with resales of the Notes. Any such request should be directed to the Issuers at their registered
addresses at 114, route de Rouffach, 68000 Colmar, France and 53 rue Nationale, 67160 Wissembourg, France. Copies of
the Indentures, the forms of the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Paying Agency Agreement and the Security
Documents will be made available upon request to the Issuers at the addresses above.

We are not currently, and we will not be, subject to the periodic reporting and other information.


-----

**Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgments**

The Issuers are organized under the laws of France and the Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the law of
France and Belgium. All of the Issuers’ directors and executive officers and the directors and executive officers of the
Guarantors are non-residents of the United States and all of the assets of the Issuers and each of the Guarantors and of those
persons are located outside the United States. Although the Issuers will each appoint an agent for service of process in the
United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action under
U.S. securities laws, you may not be able to effect service of process on such persons or the Issuers or the Guarantors
within the United States in any action, including actions predicated on civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal and state
securities laws or other laws. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United
States upon the Issuers, the Guarantor or such persons, or to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts, including
judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. In addition, we cannot assure you that civil
liabilities predicated upon the Federal securities laws of the United States will be enforceable in Belgium, France or
elsewhere.

Additionally, because the Senior Facilities Agreement will be governed by the law of England and Wales, it is likely that
a claim arising therefrom will be brought in an English court, following which enforcement of any judgment rendered
against the Issuers or a Guarantor would need to be sought in an English court.

Under the terms of the Indentures, the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Trustees agree that any dispute, controversy or cause
of action against the Issuers, the Guarantors and/or the Trustees arising out of the Indentures or any transaction
contemplated therein, the Notes or other deposited securities, will be referred to and resolved by the courts of New York,
as more fully described in the Indentures.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuers, the Guarantors or any directors or officers investors will need
to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S.
court judgments outside the United States is described below for France and Belgium, you should consult with your own
advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United
States.

**France**

The Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are entities organized under the
laws of France with their registered offices or principal places of business in France (the “French Entities”). The directors,
officers and other executives of the French Entities are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French
**Individuals”). Furthermore, most of the assets of the French Entities or the French Individuals are located outside the**
United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities,
or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state
securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France
upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial
Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

Our French counsel has advised us that the United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters.
Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated
solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or
enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before
the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e. non-ex parte) proceedings if such
U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that the following conditions


-----

have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French civil court of
the merits of the foreign judgment):

� such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is clearly
connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the choice of the U.S.
court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter;

� such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and
to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and

� such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions (i.e. those having
a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, and that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with
a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France. Where proceedings are pending before
French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and where these proceedings have the same or similar
subject matter as such U.S. judgment, the courts may stay the exequatur proceedings.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res judicata effect
as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in France after all remedies
have been exhausted. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain
circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and
French Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of documents and information of
an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit
or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action.
Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague
Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French
persons.

Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual
liberties, as most recently modified by law No. 2017-55 of January 20, 2017), as well as the GDPR will likely limit under
certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a
judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context, although the exact extent of these restrictions is yet to be
clarified.

Furthermore, we have been advised by our French counsel that if an original action is brought in France, French courts
may refuse to apply foreign law or a part of foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including
the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to
contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) (as determined on a case-by-case basis by French
courts) or in case of overriding mandatory rules (lois de police). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis
of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign
defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in
France with a French person or in a foreign country with French persons. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code,
a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations
contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant (Article 15). These provisions also apply
in the context of non-contractual obligations. For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a
French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than
French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to
the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and
the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. More specifically, according to this recent case law, a French defendant can no


-----

longer challenge the jurisdiction of a foreign tribunal on the basis of article 15 of the French civil code in circumstances
where the foreign tribunal has otherwise jurisdiction. In addition, French and foreign claimants may respectively waive
their rights respectively to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of
conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

Under Regulation (EU) No. 1215-2012 of the European Parliament and of the EU Council dated December 12, 2012 (“EU
**Regulation 1215-2012”) regarding legal actions falling within the scope of EU Regulation 1215-2012, the privileges**
granted to French nationals pursuant to articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person
domiciled in a EU Member State. However, pursuant to article 6.2 of EU Regulation 1215-2012, the privilege granted by
article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France when bringing legal action against
a defendant domiciled outside of the EU before French courts, irrespective of the claimant’s nationality. The French
Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has held that a jurisdiction clause may only be effective if it complies with the
requirement of foreseeability. This can notably be the case where the jurisdiction clause sets out an objective basis for the
determination of the competent courts. Under this analysis, a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive
jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction, which, by
definition, does not set out an objective basis for the determination of the competent courts to be chosen by the latter party,
would most likely to be considered by French Courts as not complying with the requirement of foreseeability. In particular,
on two occasions in 2012 and 2015, the civil chamber of the French supreme court (Cour de cassation) held that a
contractual provision whereby one party agrees to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the option
to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid. However, the commercial chamber of the French supreme court (Cour
_de cassation) has held the contrary by a decision dated May 11, 2017. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in_
any relevant documents may not be binding over the party having agreed to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or prevent
a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.

**Belgium**

Final and enforceable judgments rendered by foreign courts can be declared enforceable in Belgium (without review of the
foreign judgment on the merits by the Belgian courts) according to the procedure set out in Articles 22 and sq. of the
Belgian Code of International Private Law (Wetboek van Internationaal Privaatrecht) and provided that, pursuant to
Article 24 of the same Code, the following documents are produced in court by the claimant:

� an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing) fulfilling all conditions required for its authentication
under the applicable foreign law;

� if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the originating process
has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign law or an equivalent document in
accordance with the applicable foreign law demonstration that the judgment was served or notified to the party
that did not appear; and

� any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable and has been
notified to the defendant.

However, enforcement can be refused in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Belgian Code of International
Private Law and notably (and, inter alia), if:

� the consequences of the recognition or enforcement of such foreign decision would be manifestly contrary to
Belgian public policy;

� the rights of defense were not respected;

� the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets in such state
without any further connection with the litigation in such state;


-----

� without prejudice to Article 23.4 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the judgment is not final or
does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the laws of the State where the judgment was rendered
or the applicable federal rules;

� if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been sought with
the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance with Belgian conflict of
law rules;

� the decision is in conflict with either a decision rendered in Belgium or a decision previously rendered in another
state and such decision can be recognized in Belgium;

� the claim was introduced before the courts of such state after a claim, which is still pending and relating to the
same matter and between the same parties, was introduced in a Belgian court;

� the Belgian courts have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to the claim; or

� the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in relation to
insolvency proceedings or corporate standing.

Note that the foreign judgment for which enforcement is sought will not be reviewed on the merits of the judgment.

As a general principle, procedural rules are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the court (lex fori). In Belgium the
procedural rules contained in, amongst others, the Belgian Judicial Code and the Belgian Code of Private International
Law will apply when recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered by U.S. courts is sought in Belgium.

In accordance with Articles 23 and 148 of the Belgian Code of Registration Duties, a registration duty at the rate of 3% of
the amount of the judgment is levied in respect of a Belgian decision which authorizes enforcement of a judgment rendered
by a U.S. court, payable by the debtor, if the sum of money which the debtor is ordered to pay by a Belgian court judgment,
or by a foreign court judgment that is either: (i) automatically enforceable and registered in Belgium; or (ii) rendered
enforceable by a Belgian court, exceeds EUR 12,500.

Similar to France, Belgian data protection rules (including the Act of July 30, 2018 on the protection of physical persons
with regard to the processing of personal data), as well as the GDPR, will likely limit under certain circumstances the
possibility of obtaining information in Belgium or from Belgian persons in connection with a judicial or administrative
U.S. action in a discovery context, although the exact extent of these restrictions is yet to be clarified.

**Reconciliation of Laboratoire Eimer Consolidated Financial Statements to CAB Consolidated Financial**
**Statements for the Year Ended December 31, 2019**

_The offering memorandum includes the consolidated financial information of Laboratoire Eimer (“Eimer” or “standalone_
**_company”) and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with French GAAP. The following financial information is an_**
_unaudited reconciliation of CAB's consolidated income statement and balance sheet to Laboratoire Eimer's consolidated_
_financial statements, the purpose of which being to highlight the nature and amount of the differences between the two_
_contemplated issuers. The following financial Information has been prepared for the year ended December 31, 2019, on_
_the basis set out in the notes below and have been presented for illustrative purposes only._

**Basis for preparation**

The following financial information has been prepared based on the audited consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2019 of CAB and its subsidiaries and of Laboratoire Eimer and its subsidiaries as included therein.
The main differences highlighted below derive (a) from the audited statutory annual accounts for the year ended December
31, 2019 of Laboratoire Eimer and, (b) from the audited consolidation entries booked for the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements of CAB and Laboratoire Eimer.

**Nature of the principal differences**

The principal differences relate to the natures described below:

� **Harmonization of the income statements – the line item** _depreciation and amortization is presented net of_
_provision reversals while the financial expenses are presented in the line item_ _cost of debt. The historical_
consolidated financial statements of CAB have been revised to reflect these changes and aligned to the income
statement format used by Laboratoire Eimer.

� **Contribution of Laboratoire Eimer – On the balance sheet as of December 31, 2019, Eimer contributes mainly**
to the financial assets (€827.2m), the net equity (€402.8m), the redeemable shares (€275.2m) and the loans and
_borrowings (€196.7m). On the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2019, Eimer contributes mainly_
to the net sales (€12.9m), the personnel expenses (€5.2m), the other purchases and external expenses (€4.6m),
the cost of debt (€16.5m) and the net non-recurring income loss (€8.1m).

� **Entries related to the change of parent company – these entries affect the consolidated balance sheet and, in**
particular the line items financial assets, share capital, share premium and reserves. They are intended to reflect
the net equity of the parent company.

� **Intercompany eliminations – Beyond the contribution of the standalone company, further intercompany**
transactions and balances need to be eliminated between Laboratoire Eimer and CAB and its subsidiaries.

� **Contribution of Victair – Victair is directly owned and controlled by CAB. This subsidiary operates rental and**
leasing activities, and are excluded from the scope of consolidation.

The column "Other adjustments" is a residual amount constructed by difference. It primarily includes minor consolidation
adjustments and intercompany eliminations not captured under "Intercompany eliminations".

the standalone company.

(2) an unfavourable impact on Operating income before tax and Net income of respectively -14% and -26% primarily due to the additional cost
_of debt and the additional net non-recurring expenses._

(3) a favourable impact on the Consolidated EBITDA, which differs from the Adjusted EBITDA presented elsewhere in the Offering memorandum,
driven by the positive contribution of the standalone company.

#### NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

###### These notes contain additional information on the balance sheet and the income statement. All figures are expressed in millions euros, unless otherwise stated.

##### 1. General information about the Company as of 30 September 2020

###### As at 30 September 2020 the main shareholder of Laboratoire Eimer (Biogroup), is Mr. Stéphane Eimer. Laboratoire Eimer, incorporated as SELAS under French law, owns 99.99% of the financial rights and share capital in CAB, and 49.99% of the voting rights the remainder being held by medical biologists. We operate our Laboratories business, which is our main line of business, in France, through our subsidiaries, which we own through CAB, and we are one of the largest medical laboratory testing companies.

 2. Significant events of the period as of 30 Septembre 2020

##### 2.1. Change in scope of consolidation

###### The Group has pursued its external growth through the acquisition of the following businesses over the period: - Biomélis, Sèvre Biologie, Réseau Bio, bought in March 2020 ; - Laborizon, and its subsidiaries : LABORIZON MAINE ANJOU, ARNAUD BIOLYS ORIGET +, BIORYLIS, BIOLAM SELAS, LABORIZON BRETAGNE, BENHAIM, LBM DE LA MADELEINE and GIE LABORIZON, acquired at the end of July 2020 ; - Dyomedea-Néolab, acquired at the end of July 2020 - LBM CADENET-AMARA at the end of july (absorbed by BIOSYNERGIE).

##### 2.2. Financing and capital structure

###### To finance this external growth, the Group has obtained the following financing over the periods:

 - AFN 7 granted end of 2019 has been subsequently drawn in April 2020 for € 69 million - AFN 8 has been drawn in July 2020 for € 274.7 million - AFN 9 has been partially drawn in September 2020 for € 90 million to partially reimburse the Revolving Credit Facility, that had been drawn for Dyomedea acquisition earlier.

##### INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE NINE MONTHS
 ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2020

###### The presented interim condensed financial statements are for the relative period of 9 months as of 30 September 2020.

##### 3.2. General policies

###### The interim condensed financial statements for the 9 months period as of 30 September 2020 have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the French Commercial Code (Articles L 123-12 to L 123- 28), ANC Regulations no. 2015-07 of 23/11/2015 and 2016-08 of 2 December 2016, applicable to periods ending on or after 31/12/2016, and the regulations of the Comité de la Règlementation Comptable (CRC).

 The accounting policies have been applied in accordance with the principle of prudence, based on the going concern assumption and on the principle of the separation of accounting periods.

##### 3.3. Estimates

###### The preparation of financial statements in accordance with Regulation 99-02 requires certain key accounting assumptions to be made. Management must also exercise judgement in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.

 The areas in which the exercise of judgement or the complexity of the issue is most significant, or in which assumptions and estimates are material, include in particular the measurement of asset impairments and of provisions.

##### 3.4. Intercompany transactions

###### Adjustments are made for all intra-group transactions. Internal movements and intercompany receivables and payables are eliminated.

 Profits made on intra-group sales of fixed assets are not applicable.

 Dividends paid within the Group are eliminated.

 Eimer has relations with its subsidiaries fully consolidated.

 Transactions with related-parties, excluded fully consolidated subsidiairies, are not material or were entered into on an arm’s length basis.

##### 3.5. Valuation differences and goodwill

###### Valuation differences Valuation differences represent the difference between the valuation of an item in the consolidated balance sheet and the book value of the same item in the balance sheet of the controlled entity. The financial statements include no valuation differences other than consolidation adjustments.

 Goodwill

**GROUPE LABORATOIRE EIMER**


-----

##### INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE NINE MONTHS
 ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2020

###### Goodwill represents the difference between the acquisition cost of shares in consolidated companies and the share of the fair value identified at the acquisition date. Goodwill has been determined by comparing the acquisition price of the shares to the share acquired of the following items:

 � shareholders’ equity at the end of the period preceding the acquisition (less any dividends distributed during the period in which the acquisition took place), � the share of net income at the acquisition date, � the retirement provisions, � deferred tax asset in relation to the retirement provisions, � deferred tax assets in relation to temporary differences � deferred tax assets in relation to carried-forward tax losses � amortisation of business capital and of net technical loss from mergers Where necessary, goodwill has also been reduced by the sum of the following two items:

 - any dividends received during the period in which the acquisition took place, as these are taken into account when determining the price of the acquired shares; - in the event of new goodwill arising following an increase to an existing holding, the amount of any goodwill, net of amortisation, at the end of the previous period.

 Intra-group gains on sales of business capital are eliminated.

 Insofar as it is not composed of identifiable assets, business capital recognised in the balance sheets of Group companies can be equated with goodwill, as intangible with indefinite useful life. It is therefore adjusted as follows in the consolidated financial statements:

 � disclosure within intangible assets, � impairment test performed in the same way as for goodwill.

 Amortisation and impairment Until 31/12/2015, goodwill was amortised on a straight-line basis over a 20-year period, starting from the first day of the month if the acquisition took place on or before the 15th day of the month or from the first day of the following month if the acquisition took place after the 15th day of the month. Where existing on the acquisition date, business capital and net technical loss from mergers were amortised: � from the date on which control was acquired, if existing on that date, or
� from the date on their initial recognition, if recognised subsequent to the acquisition of control.

###### In line with ANC Regulation no. 2015-07 on the amortisation and impairment of goodwill in consolidated financial statements, mandatory for periods starting on or after 1 January 2016, goodwill ceased to be amortised from that period onwards.

 The company carried out an annual impairment test in 2019 on each consolidated legal entity, based on a multiple of EBITDA, which amounted to twelve times. This test is only applied starting from the second period in which the subsidiary belongs to the Group. For interim consolidated financial statements, an impairment test is performed only if a trigger event has been identified. As at 30 September 2020, no such trigger event has been identified, and no impairment has been recognised.

 � cash flows from operations comprise: - the total operating profit of the consolidated companies, adjusted for net non-recurring income or expenses, the amount of corporation tax paid, and net additions to (or reversals of) depreciation, amortisation and provisions; - movements in working capital, presented inclusive of the effect of changes in the scope of consolidation.

 � cash flows from investing activities comprise: - purchases of fixed assets, - costs of acquisitions of equity interests, corrected for acquisition-related costs net of deferred tax and less the opening cash of the companies concerned.

 � cash flows from financing activities comprise the Group’s financing transactions.

 � net cash and related instruments are defined as the sum of “Cash” and “Marketable securities” as disclosed in the balance sheet, less “Amounts due to banks”.

##### 3.7. Deferred taxation

###### Deferred taxes arise primarily from temporary differences between the accounting profit and taxable profit (which are not material), consolidation adjustments, and carried-forward tax-losses.

 The Group applies the liability method and recognises deferred tax wherever the value of an asset or liability for tax purposes is different from its value for accounting purposes.

 The effects of changes in tax rates are recognised in profit or loss for the period during which the change is enshrined in law.

 Deferred tax assets arising from carried-forward tax losses are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be offset against future profits within a reasonable timeframe.

 The possibility of recognising a tax asset in the consolidated financial statements is thus limited by the recommendations issued in Regulation 99-02.

 At 30 September 2020 no deferred tax assets were recognised in respect of tax losses.

##### 3.8. Leasing

###### Material fixed asset acquisitions made via finance leases are recognised as assets at their original cost and depreciated in the same manner as equivalent types of property, plant and equipment (in application of Regulations CRC 2002-10 and 2004-06). The debt arising from acquisitions of this type is recognised as a liability.

##### 3.9. Research and development costs

###### Costs of this type are recorded as operating expenses.

 3.10. Other intangible assets

###### These comprise: � Software and IT licences: these items are amortised over a period of 1 to 5 years. � For goodwill, business capital, and net technical loss from mergers, refer to section 3.5 above.

##### 3.11. Property, plant and equipment

###### Property, plant and equipment are valued at cost (purchase price plus ancillary costs) excluding financing costs.

 They are recognised at the amounts appearing in the individual financial statements of the consolidated companies.

 Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the likely useful lives of the assets in question. It is calculated on the historic cost of the assets. Assets are subjected to accelerated depreciation if the useful life becomes shorter than the period originally anticipated.

 The estimated useful lives of significant items of property, plant and equipment are as follow:

 Inamovible Fittings 10 years
 Fixtures and fittings 10 years
 Equipment and tooling 5 years
 Furniture, Office and IT equipment 3-5 years

##### 3.12. Financial assets

###### This item primarily comprises financial advances on share purchases.

 If required, impairments are recognised in order to reduce the net book value of financial assets to their value in use.

##### 3.13. Inventories

###### The cost of inventories is made up of the purchase price plus any ancillary costs.

 Inventories are valued in accordance with the first-in, first-out method.

 Impairments are recognised on inventories where the value as determined above differs from the current price or realisable value.

##### 3.14. Trade receivables

###### Accounts receivable are recognised at their nominal value, less any impairments required to reduce them to their actual current value. Impairments are recognised where there is a risk of non-collection due to a delay in payment or a dispute regarding the goods or services supplied.

##### 3.15. Issuance costs of borrowings

###### The issuance costs of borrowings are recognised as deferred charges and amortised over the term of the loan .

 3.16. Marketable securities

###### Marketable securities are valued at their historical cost. A valuation test is performed on the realisable value of the marketable securities and an impairment provision is established where required.

##### 3.17. Provisions for risks and charges

###### These comprise:

 � Provisions for litigation � Retirement provisions � Negative goodwill

 Management has examined all of the disputes in which the Group was involved at closing date, and, after taking external advice, the provisions have been recognised where necessary to cover the estimated risks.

 No specific adjustments are made in the consolidated financial statements in relation to provisions for risks and charges, other than the recognition of the retirement provisions where no such provision has been recognised in a company’s individual financial statements. In accordance with article 212-3 of CRC Regulation 00-06, provisions for risks and charges represent liabilities which represent probable or certain obligations at the year-end but whose payment date or amount has not been precisely ascertained.

##### 3.18. Pension and similar commitments

###### Pension commitments for the Group’s companies have been calculated in accordance with the “retrospective” method.

 Pension commitments are measured using the projected unit credit method for all employees, in proportion to
length of service and based on final salary and were calculated on the basis of the following assumptions:

###### 30/09/2020 31/12/2019
 Discount rate 1.09% 0.88%
 Future salary growth 0.83% 1.2%
 Staff turnover rate 9%-15% depending on 9%-15% depending entity on entity
 Retirement age 65 years 65 years
 Social security rate 50% 50%
 Mortality table TG 05 TG 05

 Variation are booked against P&L.

##### 3.19. Income tax

###### Income tax represents the tax payable, less any amounts in relation to tax losses carried back, research tax credits, and sponsorship tax credits.

###### Deferred tax is calculated separately for each company, taking account of consolidation adjustments and temporary differences.

##### 3.20. Segment information

###### The Group’s operating segments used in reported financial information have been identified on the basis of the internal reports used by management to allocate resources to the segments and assess their performance, and were defined according to national geography. Over the period, the group has a sole reporting segment, full activiy being located in France.

##### 4. Scope and methods of consolidation

 4.1. Structure of the Group as at 30/09/2020

###### The companies within the scope of consolidation and the consolidation methods used are as follows:

 � companies under exclusive control (fully consolidated): CAB, Victair, Biomer, Santé Labo, BC LAB, Biolam, Unibio, Astralab, 2A2B, Bioesterel, Bio Azur, Biolittoral, BPO-Bioépine, Biosynergie, Val de Meuse (merged into Biomer in July 2020), Biogroup, Biomag, Unilians, Laboschambéry, Mirialis, Alti Finances, Alpine Finances, SCI Mirhelios, SCI Unilians, GIE Biopartenaires, CBM 25, SPFPL M. Widmer (merged with CAB the 11/09/2020 with effect on the 01/01/2020), Cadenet-Amara (absorbed by Biosynergie), Réseau Bio, Biomélis, Sévre Bio, Laborizon, and its subsidiaries : Laborizon Maine Anjou, Arnaud Biolys Origet +, Biorylis, Biolam SELAS, Laborizon Bretagne, Benhaim, LBM De La Madeleine and GIE Laborizon, Dyomedea-Néolab.

 � all entities over which the Group exercises a significant or greater influence are consolidated.

 Shareholdings in non-consolidated subsidiaries totalled €3.6M. These are companies in which the group has no significant influence, are held on a temporary basis, or whose activity is unconnected with that of the Group.

 CBM 25 has been fully consolidated, notwithstanding a dispute with a third party who has contested the validity of the Group’s acquisition of shares in CBM 25. As a result of the judgment rendered by the court of first instance on 19 December 2019, whereby the Regional Court of Besançon declared the sale void and ordered provisional enforcement,the company decided in May 2020 to reassign the shares of CBM25 back to the CBM25 Sellers. CAB and the CBM25 Sellers subsequently signed a second sale and purchase agreement dated 14 May 2020 and relaunched the pre-emption procedure. As at September 30, 2020, the process is still ongoing, and the Group has been able to demonstrate de facto control, and thus fully consolidate the company.

 Contingent liabilities as of 30 September 2020 :

 � On 24/10/2018, Bio Azur was sued, jointly with its shareholders who are natural persons, by the biologist Mr Nicolas Piron for the sum of €13.6 million on grounds of non-performance of a transfer of shares between him and Ms Pascale Chevrot. This dispute is subject to a guarantee agreement connected to the acquisition of the holding in Bio Azur by LBM Bioesterel. As a result, the financial and legal consequences of this dispute will be borne by the individual shareholders, to the exclusion of any recourse to the companies Bio Azur and Bioesterel

 � Bioesterel has undergone a tax audit in relation to the 2013 and 2014 periods. The notified adjustments of €3 million, which are disputed in their entirety, concern the reclassification of the remuneration of biologists deemed to be independent workers as remuneration subject to the tax on salaries and to all other levies assessed on the basis of salary. All of the claims made by the tax authority were contested before the Administrative Court; On September 10, 2020, Bioesterel has received a notice of tax disregard for the full amount initially claimed by the Tax Administration. Litigation is closed.

 � On 4 April 2018, BPO-Bioépine was sued in the Regional Court by Mr Stéphane Madoux and the companies MS Bio and MS INV with a view to obtaining a formal finding that the transfer of all the assets of the medical biology laboratory located at Avenue Denfert Rochereau, Paris and operated by BPO-Bioépine was complete. The suit requested that BPO-Bioépine be ordered to pay contractual penalties of €1 million plus €3 million in damages. A payment of €0.5 million was expensed in 2017. There remains a possible risk that BPO-Bioépine may be ordered to pay the whole of the amounts claimed. No provision has been recognised in relation to this risk.

##### 7.10. Net income per share
###### In its consolidated financial statements, Biogroup presents basic net income per share and diluted net per share, calculated based on net income to the Group. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to owners of the parent for the year by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The average number of shares outstanding during the year is the number of shares outstanding at the beginning of the year adjusted by the number of shares issued or cancelled during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to owners of the parent for the year by the weighted average number of outstanding shares, plus potentially dilutive shares to be created.

###### The total amount of direct and indirect remuneration of all kinds received by management is not disclosed for confidentiality reason.

##### 8.3. Subsequent events affecting the structure of the Group as of 30.09.2020

**Evolution of the Group**

On October 30, 2020, the Group acquired 100% of eight companies of Medina Group (“Medina Acquisition”),
for €1 030.5M, which is the leading laboratory operator in Belgium in terms of net sales, to expand our operations
to the Belgian medical lab testing market. The Medina Acquisition was in part financed by ICG, one of our
investors, through an equity contribution. In addition, Straco, which previously owned the Medina Group, has since
become one of our investors by reinvesting part of the proceeds from the Medina Acquisition in our Group. The
medina Acquisition was also financed through a mix of cash available and additional financial indebtness,
comprising a Term Loan B add-on of € 536 million �����������������������������������������������������������
and an additional Second Lien of € 118 million.

Regarding the CBM 25 acquisition process, on 24 November 2020, the Tribunal Judiciaire of Besançon ordered the
suspension of the delay for LBI Développement to pre-empt until certain information would be disclosed.
Further to that second litigation, CAB decided to let the second sale and purchase agreement lapse on 1 December
2020 and the CBM25 Sellers notified LBI Développement on December 4[th] 2020 that they no longer intend to sell
the CBM25 shares. As a consequence, all ongoing processes were stopped, and control can’t be demonstrated
anymore, leading to the deconsolidation of CBM 25. As of 30 September 2020, CBM 25 did represent sales of
€16.6M, net income contribution of €2.6M and total assets of €10.2M€

**COVID 19**
On October 30, 2020, the French Government decided a second lockdown in the context of a growing number of
infections to COVID 19 virus. Thanks to less restrictive measures mandated by the Government, we did not notice
such as decrease in our routine activity as in the initial lockdown. Moreover, the RT-PCR testing activity has
continued, and is still continuing, more than compensating the effect of this second lockdown.

##### 3. Accounting policies and valuation methods

 3.1. Reporting date

###### All consolidated companies prepare their individual financial statements to 31 December except the two intermediate holding companies Alpine Finances and Alti Finances, which prepare accounts to 30 June, and CBM 25, which prepares its accounts to 31 October (but draw up interim accounts).

##### 3.2. General policies

###### The financial statements for the 3 years ended 31/12/2019, 31/12/2018 and 31/12/2017 have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the French Commercial Code (Articles L 123-12 to L 123-28), ANC Regulations no. 2015-07 of 23/11/2015 and 2016-08 of 2 December 2016, applicable to periods ending on or after 31/12/2016, and the regulations of the Comité de la Règlementation Comptable (CRC).

 The accounting policies have been applied in accordance with the principle of prudence, based on the going concern assumption and on the principle of the separation of accounting periods. 

##### 3.3. Estimates

###### The preparation of financial statements in accordance with Regulation 99-02 requires certain key accounting assumptions to be made. Management must also exercise judgement in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.


-----

###### The areas in which the exercise of judgement or the complexity of the issue is most significant, or in which assumptions and estimates are material, include in particular the measurement of asset impairments and of provisions. 

##### 3.4. Intercompany transactions

###### Adjustments are made for all intra-group transactions. Internal movements and intercompany receivables and payables are eliminated.

 Profits made on intra-group sales of fixed assets are not applicable.

 Dividends paid within the Group are eliminated.

 Eimer has relations with its subsidiaries fully consolidated.

 Transactions with related-parties, excluded fully consolidated subsidiairies, are not material or were entered into on an arm’s length basis.

##### 3.5. Valuation differences and goodwill

###### Valuation differences Valuation differences represent the difference between the valuation of an item in the consolidated balance sheet and the book value of the same item in the balance sheet of the controlled entity. The financial statements include no valuation differences other than consolidation adjustments.

 Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the acquisition cost of shares in consolidated companies and the share of the fair value identified at the acquisition date. Goodwill has been determined by comparing the acquisition price of the shares to the share acquired of the following items:

 � shareholders’ equity at the end of the period preceding the acquisition (less any dividends distributed during the period in which the acquisition took place), � the share of net income at the acquisition date, � the retirement provisions, � deferred tax asset in relation to the retirement provisions, � deferred tax assets in relation to temporary differences � deferred tax assets in relation to carried-forward tax losses � amortisation of business capital and of net technical loss from mergers Where necessary, goodwill has also been reduced by the sum of the following two items:

 - any dividends received during the period in which the acquisition took place, as these are taken into account when determining the price of the acquired shares; - in the event of new goodwill arising following an increase to an existing holding, the amount of any goodwill, net of amortisation, at the end of the previous period.

 Intra-group gains on sales of business capital are eliminated.


-----

###### Insofar as it is not composed of identifiable assets, business capital recognised in the balance sheets of Group companies can be equated with goodwill, as intangible with indefinite useful life. It is therefore adjusted as follows in the consolidated financial statements:

 � disclosure within intangible assets, � impairment test performed in the same way as for goodwill.

 Amortisation and impairment Until 31/12/2015, goodwill was amortised on a straight-line basis over a 20-year period, starting from the first day of the month if the acquisition took place on or before the 15th day of the month or from the first day of the following month if the acquisition took place after the 15th day of the month. Where existing on the acquisition date, business capital and net technical loss from mergers were amortised: � from the date on which control was acquired, if existing on that date, or
� from the date on their initial recognition, if recognised subsequent to the acquisition of control.

###### In line with ANC Regulation no. 2015-07 on the amortisation and impairment of goodwill in consolidated financial statements, mandatory for periods starting on or after 1 January 2016, goodwill ceased to be amortised from that period onwards.

 The company carries out an impairment test on each consolidated legal entity, based on a multiple of twelve times EBITDA in 2019, eleven times EBITDA in 2018 and ten times EBITDA in 2017. This test is only applied starting from the second period in which the subsidiary belongs to the Group. Performance of this impairment test has not given rise to the recognition of a provision.

##### 3.6. Cash flows statement

###### In the consolidated cash flows statement:

 � cash flows from operations comprise: - the total operating profit of the consolidated companies, adjusted for net non-recurring income or expenses, the amount of corporation tax paid, and net additions to (or reversals of) depreciation, amortisation and provisions; - movements in working capital, presented inclusive of the effect of changes in the scope of consolidation.

 � cash flows from investing activities comprise: - purchases of fixed assets, - costs of acquisitions of equity interests, corrected for acquisition-related costs net of deferred tax and less the opening cash of the companies concerned.

 � cash flows from financing activities comprise the Group’s financing transactions.

 � net cash and related instruments are defined as the sum of “Cash” and “Marketable securities” as disclosed in the balance sheet, less “Amounts due to banks”.

##### 3.7. Deferred taxation

###### Deferred taxes arise primarily from temporary differences between the accounting profit and taxable profit (which are not material), consolidation adjustments, and carried-forward tax-losses.


-----

###### The Group applies the liability method and recognises deferred tax wherever the value of an asset or liability for tax purposes is different from its value for accounting purposes.

 The effects of changes in tax rates are recognised in profit or loss for the period during which the change is enshrined in law.

 Deferred tax assets arising from carried-forward tax losses are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be offset against future profits within a reasonable timeframe.

 The possibility of recognising a tax asset in the consolidated financial statements is thus limited by the recommendations issued in Regulation 99-02.

 At 31 December 2019, as at 31 December 2018 and at 31 December 2017, no deferred tax assets were recognised in respect of tax losses.

##### 3.8. Leasing

###### Material fixed asset acquisitions made via finance leases are recognised as assets at their original cost and depreciated in the same manner as equivalent types of property, plant and equipment (in application of Regulations CRC 2002-10 and 2004-06). The debt arising from acquisitions of this type is recognised as a liability.

##### 3.9. Research and development costs

###### Costs of this type are recorded as operating expenses.

##### 3.10. Other intangible assets

###### These comprise: � Software and IT licences: these items are amortised over a period of 1 to 5 years. � For goodwill, business capital, and net technical loss from mergers, refer to section 3.5 above.

##### 3.11. Property, plant and equipment

###### Property, plant and equipment are valued at cost (purchase price plus ancillary costs) excluding financing costs.

 They are recognised at the amounts appearing in the individual financial statements of the consolidated companies.

 Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the likely useful lives of the assets in question. It is calculated on the historic cost of the assets. Assets are subjected to accelerated depreciation if the useful life becomes shorter than the period originally anticipated.

 The estimated useful lives of significant items of property, plant and equipment are as follows :

 Inamovible fittings 10 years Fixtures and fittings 10 years Equipment and tooling 5 years Furniture, Office and IT equipment 3-5 years

##### 3.12. Financial assets


-----

###### This item primarily comprises financial advances on share purchases.

 If required, impairments are recognised in order to reduce the net book value of financial assets to their value in use.

##### 3.13. Inventories

###### The cost of inventories is made up of the purchase price plus any ancillary costs.

 Inventories are valued in accordance with the first-in, first-out method.

 Impairments are recognised on inventories where the value as determined above differs from the current price or realisable value.

##### 3.14. Trade receivables

###### Accounts receivable are recognised at their nominal value, less any impairments required to reduce them to their actual current value. Impairments are recognised where there is a risk of non- collection due to a delay in payment or a dispute regarding the goods or services supplied.

##### 3.15. Issuance costs of borrowings

###### The issuance costs of borrowings are recognised as deferred charges and amortised over the term of the loan . 

##### 3.16. Marketable securities

###### Marketable securities are valued at their historical cost. A valuation test is performed on the realisable value of the marketable securities and an impairment provision is established where required.

##### 3.17. Provisions for risks and charges

###### These comprise:

 � Provisions for litigation � Retirement provisions � Negative goodwill

 Management has examined all of the disputes in which the Group was involved at the year-end, and, after taking external advice, the provisions have been recognised where necessary to cover the estimated risks.

 No specific adjustments are made in the consolidated financial statements in relation to provisions for risks and charges, other than the recognition of the retirement provisions where no such provision has been recognised in a company’s individual financial statements. In accordance with article 212-3 of CRC Regulation 00-06, provisions for risks and charges represent liabilities which represent probable or certain obligations at the year-end but whose payment date or amount has not been precisely ascertained.

##### 3.18. Pension and similar commitments

###### Pension commitments for the Group’s companies have been calculated in accordance with the “retrospective” method.


-----

###### Pension commitments are measured using the projected unit credit method for all employees, in
proportion to length of service and based on final salary and were calculated on the basis of the
###### following assumptions:

31.12.2019 31.12.2018 31.12.2017

Discount rate 0.88% 2% 2%
Future salary growth 1.20% 1.5% 1.5%

Retirement age 65 years 65 years 65 years
Social security rate 50% 50% 50%
Mortality table TG 05 TG 05 TG 05

###### Variation are booked against P&L.

##### 3.19. Income tax

###### Income tax represents the tax payable, less any amounts in relation to tax losses carried back, research tax credits, and sponsorship tax credits.

 Deferred tax is calculated separately for each company, taking account of consolidation adjustments and temporary differences.

##### 3.20. Segment information

###### The Group’s operating segments used in reported financial information have been identified on the basis of the internal reports used by management to allocate resources to the segments and assess their performance, and were defined according to national localisation. Over the three periods, the group has a sole reporting segment, full activiy being located in France.

##### 4. Scope and methods of consolidation

 4.1. Structure of the Group as at 31/12/2019

% Voting rights % Financial rights

###### The companies within the scope of consolidation and the consolidation methods used are as follows:

 � companies under exclusive control (fully consolidated): CAB, Victair, Biomer, Santé Labo, BC LAB, Biolam, Unibio, Astralab, 2A2B, Bioesterel, Bio Azur, Biolittoral, BPO-Bioépine, Biosynergie, Val de Meuse, Biogroup, Biomag, Unilians, Laboschambéry, Mirialis, Alti Finances, Alpine Finances, SCI Mirhelios, SCI Unilians, GIE Biopartenaires, CBM 25, SPFPL M. Widmer.
� all entities over which the Group exercises a significant or greater influence are consolidated.

###### Shareholdings in non-consolidated subsidiaries totalled €1,771 thousand. These are companies in which the group has no significant influence, are held on a temporary basis, or whose activity is unconnected with that of the Group.

 CBM 25 and SPFPL M. Widmer have been fully consolidated, notwithstanding an ongoing dispute with a third party who has contested the validity of SPFPL M. Widmer’s acquisition of shares in CBM 25. As a result of the dispute, the CBM 25 shares were placed in sequestration with effect from 6 August 2019 until judgment was rendered by the court of first instance on 19 December 2019, whereby the Regional Court of Besançon declared the sale void and ordered provisional enforcement. The company appealed the decision on substantive grounds and applied to the First President of the Court for a suspension of the provisional enforcement. On the FY2019 closing date the decision had not been enforced, the shares thus remained in the ownership of the Group as of 31.12.2019.

###### Unilians (together with the subgroup formed by its subsidiaries) and BC Lab are fully consolidated notwithstanding a percentage of control below 40%. The use of the full consolidation method is based in both cases on clauses in the articles of association that grant de facto control to the parent company, Eimer.

###### Until 31/12/2015, goodwill was amortised over a 20-year period.  Since 2016, an annual impairment test has been conducted. The EBITDA multiple used to carry out this test at 31 December 2019 was 12 (2018: 11), (2017:10) this figure being based on the features of recent transactions carried out by the Group. No impairment charges on goodwill were required in the 2019 financial year. This is also the case for 2018 and 2017.  As of 31.12.2019 an impairment charge of M€ 8,1 was recognised during the period on the intangible assets with indefinite useful life at Eimer level. No other significant impairment charge were booked against intangible assets in FY 2018 and 2017 Main impacts from acquisitions over the 3 periods are presented in the section “significant events”, please refer to that section for detailed information over Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life.

###### Movements in provisions and depreciations over the 3 years were as follows:

 Litigation are mainly composed of employees litigations.

 Contingent liabilities as of 31 December 2019:

 � On 24/10/2018, Bio Azur was sued, jointly with its shareholders who are natural persons, by the biologist Mr Nicolas Piron for the sum of €13.6 million on grounds of non-performance of a transfer of shares between him and Ms Pascale Chevrot. This dispute is subject to a guarantee agreement connected to the acquisition of the holding in Bio Azur by LBM Bioesterel. As a result, the financial and legal consequences of this dispute will be borne by the individual shareholders, to the exclusion of any recourse to the companies Bio Azur and Bioesterel

 � Bioesterel has undergone a tax audit in relation to the 2013 and 2014 periods. The notified adjustments of €3 million, which are disputed in their entirety, concern the reclassification of the remuneration of biologists deemed to be independent workers as remuneration subject to the tax on salaries and to all other levies assessed on the basis of salary. All of the claims made by the tax authority are being contested before the Administrative Court; as agreed with the specialist lawyers, no provision has been established. To guarantee the payment of the amounts claimed, LBM Bioesterel has obtained a directly enforceable guarantee from Crédit Agricole. The risk is also covered by the seller’s warranty.

 � On 4 April 2018, BPO-Bioépine was sued in the Regional Court by Mr Stéphane Madoux and the companies MS Bio and MS INV with a view to obtaining a formal finding that the transfer of all the assets of the medical biology laboratory located at Avenue Denfert Rochereau, Paris


-----

###### and operated by BPO-Bioépine was complete. The suit requested that BPO-Bioépine be ordered to pay contractual penalties of €1 million plus €3 million in damages. A payment of €0.5 million was expensed in 2017. There remains a possible risk that BPO-Bioépine may be ordered to pay the whole of the amounts claimed. No provision has been recognised in relation to this risk.

##### 7.10. Net income per share

###### In its consolidated financial statements, Biogroup presents basic net income per share and diluted net per share, calculated based on net income to the Group. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to owners of the parent for the year by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The average number of shares outstanding during the year is the number of shares outstanding at the beginning of the year adjusted by the number of shares issued or cancelled during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to owners of the parent for the year by the weighted average number of outstanding shares, plus potentially dilutive shares to be created. This concerns convertible bonds and redeemable preferred shares. For the 3 periods, only dilutive instruments are taken into account. Convertible bonds are qualified anti-dilutive over the 3 periods and are not taken into account, and redeemable bonds are qualified anti-dilutive for 2018 and 2017 and taken into account in 2019.

###### A major event of early 2020 has been the COVID-19 public health crisis. However, as this subsequent event is unconnected to any situation already existing at 31 December 2019, we have not adjusted our financial statements for the year ended on that date.

 Owing to the full lockdown measures put in place, the Group has noted a substantial downturn in business since the lockdown began, which is linked to the reduced number of prescriptions being issued by doctors. Nevertheless, the gradual increase in tests carried out in connection with the fight against COVID-19 is making up for the regular activity of our sites.

 As of the closing date of 2019 of the consolidated accounts, the Group is not in a position to quantify the impact of the epidemic on results. However, the Group has access to significant liquid funds, both via its available cash and due to the available revolving credit facilities (as of the closing date of 2019 of the consolidated accounts). We have also availed ourselves of the options to delay payment of certain tax and social security charges, and therefore consider that our ability to continue as a going concern is not in question.

 Evolution of the Group since 31.12.2019 until closing of accounts in 2020

 In early March 2020, the Group acquired majority interests in three professional partnerships based in western France, Réseau Bio, Sèvres Biologie and Biomélys, for €27,658 thousand. This acquisition was financed from available cash and by a drawdown of the revolving credit facility.

##### As of 31.12.2018

In early 2019, the group continued to grow, acquiring a stake in the companies Bioazur, Biomag and Unilians.

##### As of 31.12.2017

###### In early 2018, the group acquired a stake in the company Bio Paris Ouest and continues its desire for external growth.

 This equity investment was carried out by a contribution of shares in the company Biolam LCD and a capital increase followed by a capital reduction.

 In addition, various operations to increase or reduce capital were carried out (the company Biolam LCD carried out an increase reserved for CAB; the company Biomer carried out a capital reduction); the company Eimer carried out a capital reduction and issued bonds with attached
warrants for the amount of M€ 95.

##### 8.4. Statutory auditors’ fees

###### As of 31.12.2019 statutory auditors’ fees for all the companies in the consolidated group totalled €175,500 in relation to audit services and €147,500 for other services.  As of 31.12.2018 statutory auditors’ fees for all the companies in the consolidated group totalled €395,058 in relation to audit services and €87,650 for other services.  As of 31.12.2017 statutory auditors’ fees for all the companies in the consolidated group totalled €285,670 in relation to audit services and €31,369 for other services.
