Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment in respect of
the securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the securities is eligible counterparties and professional
clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the securities to eligible counterparties
and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the securities (a
‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without prejudice
to the Issuer’s (as defined in the offering memorandum) obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to
MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the securities (by either adopting or
refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment in respect of
the securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the securities is only eligible counterparties, as defined

No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution

assessment in respect of the securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and
determining appropriate distribution channels.

required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities
or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the
securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS

that no such offer of Notes shall require us or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 1 of the


-----

Prospectus Regulation, or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation. Accordingly, any
person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which
no obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial
Purchasers have authorized, nor do authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary, other
than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering
Memorandum.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer to the public” shall have the meaning ascribed in the Prospectus
Regulation.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a Relevant State will be deemed to have
represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a “qualified investor” within the meaning of Article 2(e) of the Prospectus
Regulation. The Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates, and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the
foregoing representation, acknowledgement and agreement. Notwithstanding the above, a person who is not a qualified
investor and who has notified the Initial Purchasers of such fact in writing may, with the consent of the Initial Purchasers,
be permitted to subscribe for or purchase the Notes in the Offering.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
Notes as defined in the offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes
to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the
Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**Notice to Investors in France**

This offering memorandum has not been prepared in the context of an offer to the public of financial securities within the
meaning of the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, the Notes may not be, directly or indirectly, offered or sold to the
public in France (offre au public de titres financiers), and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material
may be distributed to the public in France. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Notes may be offered and sold in France
exclusively to a limited number of investors acting for their own account (cercle restreint d’investisseurs agissant pour
_compte propre) in accordance with Article L.411-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et_
_financier) or to qualified investors (investisseurs qualifiés) as defined by Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation._
Prospective investors are informed that: (i) this offering memorandum has not been and will not be submitted for clearance
to the Autorité des marchés financiers (the “AMF”); and (ii) the direct and indirect distribution or sale to the public of the
Notes acquired by them may only be made in compliance with Articles L.411-1 and L.411-2 of the French Monetary and
Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier) and applicable regulation thereunder. Investors in France and persons into
whose possession offering materials come must inform themselves about, and observe, any such restrictions.

**Notice to Investors in Switzerland**

The Notes may not be publicly offered, advertised, distributed or sold in Switzerland and will not be listed on the SIX
Swiss Exchange or on any other stock exchange or regulated multilateral trading facility in Switzerland. This document
does not constitute an offering prospectus and has been prepared without regard to the disclosure standards for issuance
prospectuses under art. 652a or art. 1156 of the Swiss Code of Obligations, art. 35 et seq. of the Swiss Financial Services
Act (the “FinSA”) or the disclosure standards for listing prospectuses under art. 27 et seq. of the SIX Listing Rules or the
listing rules of any other stock exchange or regulated multilateral trading facility in Switzerland. Neither this document nor
any other offering or marketing material relating to the Notes or the offering may be publicly distributed or otherwise made
publicly available in Switzerland.

Neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering or marketing material relating to the Offering, the Issuer, or the
Notes have been or will be filed with or approved by any Swiss regulatory authority. In particular, this offering


-----

memorandum will not be filed with, and the offer of Notes will not be supervised by, the Swiss Financial Market
Supervisory Authority, and the Offering has not been and will not be authorized under the Swiss Federal Act on Collective
Investment Schemes (the “CISA”). The investor protection afforded to acquirers of interests in collective investment
schemes under the CISA does not extend to acquirers of Notes.

**Notice to Investors in the United Kingdom**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment in respect of
the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the
FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No.
600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of
the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK
**MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the**
Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within
the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations
made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the UK has been or will be prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be made pursuant to
an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK
**Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is**
not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

**Presentation of Financial and Other Information**

**Presentation of Financial Information**

The historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum is that of Laboratoire Eimer and its
consolidated subsidiaries, including the Issuer. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, all references to “we”, “us”, “our”,
“Biogroup” or the “Group” in respect of historical financial information in this offering memorandum are to Laboratoire
Eimer and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. For a reconciliation of the consolidated financial statements of
Laboratoire Eimer to those of the Issuer, see “Reconciliation of Laboratoire Eimer Consolidated Financial Statements to
_CAB Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended December 31, 2020.”_

This offering memorandum includes the following financial information of Laboratoire Eimer and its subsidiaries:

      - the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020
prepared in accordance with French GAAP (each the “2018 Audited Financial Statements”, “2019 Audited
**Financial Statements”, and “2020 Audited Financial Statements”, respectively, and collectively, the “Audited**
**Financial Statements”); and**

      - the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, prepared
in accordance with French GAAP (the “Unaudited Interim Financial Statements”).

The audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 are included in this offering
memorandum for informational purposes only and are not included in _“Summary Consolidated Financial and Other_
_Information —Other Financial and Operating Data” or “Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Information”._ As
such, you should not place undue reliance on this information.

The Indenture allows us to report consolidated financial statements and other information for Laboratoire Eimer and its
subsidiaries. The fiscal year of Laboratoire Eimer ends on December 31 of each calendar year. The consolidated financial
statements of Laboratoire Eimer included in this offering memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any
changes to the income statements, balance sheets or cash flow statements that might occur as a result of purchase accounting
adjustments to be applied as a result of acquisitions, including the 2021 H1 Acquisitions. However, Laboratoire Eimer will
account for acquisitions (including the 2021 Acquisitions) using the purchase method of accounting under French GAAP.
The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add
to our balance sheet, which may include intangible assets such as goodwill, and different amortization and depreciation
expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future financial statements could be materially different once
the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the Audited Financial Statements or Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements included in this offering memorandum. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements”._

Certain figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial data presented in millions or thousands and
percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in
this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. Percentages and
amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data set forth in “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are calculated using the numerical data in our consolidated_
financial statements or the tabular presentation of other data (subject to rounding) contained in this offering memorandum,
as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

This offering memorandum contains non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact), and certain coverage ratios
that are not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, French GAAP or IFRS. Such measures and ratios
may not reflect accurately our performance, liquidity or our ability to incur debt and should not be considered as alternatives
to operating income/(loss) or net profit/(loss) or any other performance measures derived from or in accordance with U.S.


-----

GAAP, SEC requirements or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to net cash provided
by/(used in) operating activities. The financial information contained in this offering memorandum is not intended to

our management as non-recurring in nature;

 temporary reduction in prices of medical lab tests imposed by regulatory authorities at the end of 2018;

      - **Pro Forma net sales represents net sales as further adjusted for the full year effect on our net sales from the**
companies we acquired since July 1, 2020, as if such acquisition had been completed on January 1 of the financial
year in which they were acquired (January 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021, as the case may be) and excluding divested
sites.

      - **Pro forma net sales (excluding COVID-19 impact) represents pro forma net sales as further adjusted for the**
full period effect on our pro forma net sales based on the restatement of the negative impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the net sales that occurred during various lockdowns and otherwise, and the restatement of the
positive impact on net sales generated by COVID-19 related testing activity while adding back any recurring
COVID-19 impact.

      - **Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted for the full run rate effect on**
our Adjusted EBITDA from the companies we acquired since July 1, 2020, as if such acquisition had been
completed on January 1 of the financial year in which they were acquired, January 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021, as
the case may be, estimated cost savings and synergies from these acquisitions on an annual run rate basis and an
elimination of the transaction costs associated with such acquisitions.

      - **Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA** **margin represents Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA divided by pro forma net sales.**

      - **Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA** **(excluding COVID-19 impact) represents Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as**

otherwise, and the restatement of the positive impact on EBITDA generated by COVID-19 related testing activity
while adding back any recurring COVID-19 impact.


-----

      - **Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) margin represents •** Pro Forma Adjusted

EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) margin divided by pro forma net sales (excluding COVID-19 margin).

      - **Net capital expenditures** represent acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets net of
disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and excluding acquisitions of businesses.

      - **Net capital expenditures margin, expressed as a percentage, is calculated as (i) net capital expenditures divided**
by (ii) total net sales.

For more information, see “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other Financial and Operating
_Data”._

This offering memorandum contains certain synergy estimates, among others, relating to cost reductions and other benefits
expected to arise from the Acquisitions as well as adjustments for related costs to implement such acquisitions. The
estimates present the expected future impact of these transactions and the integration of these companies into our existing
business on a run-rate basis. Such estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information
available to us and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating the synergies
arising from these acquisitions are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic,
and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the
synergy benefit estimates.

We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact), Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding
COVID-19 impact) margin and net capital expenditures margin for informational purposes only. This information does not
represent the results we would have achieved had each of the acquisitions or other transactions for which an adjustment is
made occurred at the dates indicated. There is no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring
will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The calculations for EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin, Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact)
margin are based on various assumptions (including the successful implementation of certain initiatives), management
estimates and the unaudited management accounts of the acquired businesses. These amounts have not been, and, in certain
cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information is inherently subject
to risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that items we have identified as non-recurring will not recur in the future
or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The term “non-recurring” shall not be construed as being used in
accordance with the criteria as set forth in Item 10(c) of Regulation S-K under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act. It may
not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the acquired businesses or
other transactions for the periods presented, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other
financial information included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment
decision.

We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
(excluding COVID-19 impact) because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance
and ability to service our debt. These measures are not measurements of financial performance under French GAAP or
IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other
measure of performance derived in accordance with French GAAP or IFRS. EBITDA and its variants as presented in this
offering memorandum may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies and from “Consolidated
EBITDA” contained in the section entitled “Description of the Notes” of this offering memorandum and in the Indenture.
For a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
(excluding COVID-19 impact) to operating income (loss), see “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information
_—Other Financial and Operating Data”._

We also present net sales from organic growth, which we calculate as the variation of net sales generated in any two
subsequent years on the basis of a constant scope of consolidation for the first of these two years. This approach results in


-----

a growing organic growth portfolio over time and does not allow for comparison across all periods presented in this offering
memorandum. These organic growth figures may deviate from the presentation of organic growth in our historic and future
financial reporting, which is computed on a dynamic basis, comparing against the perimeter of the relevant prior-year
period. Net sales from organic growth are prepared by our management and provide a useful measure of our ongoing
organic performance but are not included in our historical financial information or prepared in accordance with French
GAAP or IFRS.

The non-French GAAP measures presented in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for analysis of our operating results as reported under French GAAP. Some of the limitations of each of these non-French
GAAP measures are:

      - they do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

      - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital;

      - they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments, on indebtedness;

      - they do not reflect income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;

      - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will
often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements;
and

      - other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) differently than as
presented in this offering memorandum, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) and the related ratios presented throughout this offering memorandum should not
be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in business growth or reduce indebtedness.

**Last Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2021**

The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 is calculated
by taking the results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and adding to them the difference between the
results of operations for the full year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2020. The financial
information for the six and twelve months ended June 30, 2021, is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the year ending December 31, 2021 and should not be used as the basis for or prediction of an annualized
calculation.

**As Adjusted Financial Information**

We present in this offering memorandum certain as adjusted financial information for Laboratoire Eimer and the Issuer,
which is based on the unaudited interim consolidated financial information, pro forma adjusted financial information for
the Issuer on an as adjusted basis to reflect certain effects of the Transactions and certain acquisitions (including the 2021
Acquisitions) on the indebtedness, cash position and interest expense of the Issuer as of and for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2021. See “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other Financial and Operating Data.”
This as adjusted financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what our
actual interest expense would have been had the Offering occurred on June 30, 2021 or what our actual cash position or
indebtedness would have been had the Transactions and the acquisitions referenced therein occurred on June 30, 2021, nor
does it purport to project our indebtedness, cash position or interest expense at any future date. The adjusted financial


-----

information has not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statement, balance sheet or cash flow
statement that might occur as a result of application of the acquisition method of accounting under French GAAP, which
will affect the comparability of the Issuer’s future consolidated financial statements with the financial statements contained
in this offering memorandum. The as adjusted financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted
accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the resulting adjusted financial information
have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.

**Change in certain Accounting Standards**

During the periods under review in this Offering Memorandum, we have adopted certain accounting standards that may
have an impact on the comparability of the financial information presented herein. This includes the application of the new
regulation ANC 2020-01 mentioned in Note 3.2 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. The application of the new
regulation represents a change in accounting method and has been applied prospectively, with no significant impact on the
consolidated financial statements of Laboratoire Eimer as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, other than a
change in presentation of the balance sheet and the income statement. These changes in presentation have also been made
to the comparative financial information included in the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. As a result, our
consolidated financial statements as at and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum may not be directly comparable with those as of and for the six-month period ended June
30, 2021.

**Differences between French GAAP and IFRS**

We include in this offering memorandum financial information prepared under French GAAP. French GAAP differs in
significant respects from IFRS. Given the differences between French GAAP and IFRS, if we were to prepare our financial
statements on the basis of IFRS instead of French GAAP, we cannot guarantee that there could not be substantial
differences in our results of operations, cash flows and balance sheet, including levels of indebtedness. Prospective
investors are advised to consult their professional advisors for an understanding of: (i) the differences between French
GAAP and other systems of generally accepted accounting principles and how those differences might affect the financial
information included in this offering memorandum; and (ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments of, French
GAAP may have on the financial information presented in this offering memorandum, our results of operations and/or
financial condition, as well as on the comparability of prior periods. For a discussion of certain differences between French
GAAP and IFRS as applied by us, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Certain differences between French GAAP and IFRS”._

**Industry and Market Information**

Unless otherwise expressly indicated or noted below, all information regarding markets, market size, market share, market
position, growth rates and other industry data pertaining to our business contained in this offering memorandum are based
on estimates prepared by us based on certain assumptions and our knowledge of the industry in which we operate, as well
as data from various market research publications, publicly available information and industry publications, including
reports published by various third-party sources. Industry publications generally state that the information they contain has
been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not
guaranteed. We have not independently verified such data. We use a combination of data provided by the French Court of
Audit (Cour des Comptes), the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (“INSEE”), the Directorate
for Research, Studies, Assessments and Statistics (“DREES”), the French National Health Insurance Fund (“CNAMTS”),
Assurance Maladie for the French market, the Belgian National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance
(“RIZIV/INAMI”) for the Belgian market and other industry sources.

In many cases, there is no readily available external information (whether from trade associations, government bodies or
other organizations) to validate market-related analysis and estimates, requiring us to rely on our own internally developed
estimates regarding the industry in which we operate, our position in the industry, our market share and the market shares
of various industry participants based on experience, our own investigation of market conditions and our review of industry
publications, including information made available to the public by our competitors. While we have examined and relied
upon certain market or other industry data from external sources as the basis for our estimates, including an industry report
prepared by a major third-party consulting firm (the “industry report”) and a sustainability analysis report prepared by a
third-party independent strategy advisor (the “sustainability report”), which were commissioned by Biogroup, neither we
nor the Initial Purchasers have verified that data. We and the Initial Purchasers cannot assure you of, and take no
responsibility for, the accuracy and completeness of such data. Similarly, while we believe our internal estimates to be
reasonable, these estimates have not been verified by any independent source and we and the Initial Purchasers cannot
assure you as to their accuracy. Our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various
factors, including those discussed under “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements”. Furthermore, the markets in
which we operate and compete may have shifted or changed since the date that the industry report was prepared and in
particular, the industry report may not contemplate the effects of COVID-19. These and other factors could cause results
to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by us.

Industry publications, surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from
sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. Where we
have found information from different sources to be conflicting, we have used the information that we believe to be the
most accurate and prepared on a basis consistent with the other sources we have used.

The contents of any website, including the websites of any member of the Group, do not form any part of this offering
memorandum.

_memorandum._

**Overview**

We are a leading routine diagnostics company in Europe and we believe we are the leading private medical laboratory
services company by market share in France and Belgium, providing medical laboratory testing services through a large
and dense network of 1,605 collection sites across seven regions in France, one region in Belgium and in six other regions
abroad (including the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Brazil) of the date of this offering
memorandum. We focus mainly on routine lab testing which is conducted exclusively in-house and also offer specialized
tests which can be performed in-house or outsourced to our outsourcing partners. Our in-house testing generally comprises
approximately 98% of our test volume. We outsource only a small portion of specialized tests with low demand (thereby
less profitable to invest in resources to conduct the tests in-house). In France, our customers are mainly patients, whereas
our Belgian customers are generally both doctors and patients. Our local technical platforms also assist nearby clinics with
their medical testing demands.

We perform a range of over 372 medical lab tests with varying degrees of automation, complexity and volume (including
clinical biochemistry, molecular diagnostics, infertility diagnosis, tumor marker testing, microbiology, cytology and
pathology, allergy tests and genetic tests) for patients who have either generally been prescribed these tests by their doctors
or who elect to get tested for certain non-prescribed medical tests.

We have grown our market presence in France, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg through acquisitions of technical
platforms and large networks of nearby collection sites in regions with attractive demographic factors (such as high density
populations, aging populations and affluence), followed by smaller bolt-on acquisitions to create density around technical
platforms and ensure maximization of operating efficiency. Through 57 acquisitions since 2015, we have demonstrated
our ability to consistently deliver on forecast synergies and cost savings, and extract high levels of profitability. Our founder
and shareholder Dr. Stéphane Eimer’s strategic vision and successful track record of consolidation, expertise, industry
knowledge and network, further assisted by our investors and competent management at local laboratory levels, historically
have been an important differentiator during these acquisitions, and our culture as a scientifically-led organization (driven
by ownership by a medical biologist instead of a financial sponsor) uniquely sets us apart from our competitors.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our net sales were €2,107.5 million and our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
(excluding COVID-19 impact) was €468.7 million. See “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other
_Financial and Operating Data.”_

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Present in growing and resilient markets characterized by strong fundamentals and providing further growth_**
**_opportunities_**

Our core markets are the routine outpatient private laboratory testing markets in France, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg.
France and Belgium represented €4.6 billion and €0.6 billion in net sales in 2020, respectively, and France, Belgium, Spain
and Luxembourg generated approximately €4.7 billion, €0.6 billion, €2.9 billion and €0.1 billion in net sales in 2019,
respectively. We believe that we benefit from resilient, non-cyclical demand for clinical diagnostics services that delivers
reliable organic growth. This growth is due in part to favorable market drivers in our markets, such as an aging populations,
population growth, growth in the prevalence of chronic diseases, driven by lifestyle trends such as low levels of physical
activity, poor nutrition and stress, an increase in the number of consultations per inhabitant and number of tests per


-----

consultation and increasing focus on disease prevention. We believe these factors are conducive to increased testing
frequency, driving volume growth in the market, while the essential nature of the testing services we provide contributes
to demand resilience, as exhibited during the COVID-19 pandemic by the significant increase in volume of medical tests
due to the demand for COVID-19-related testing, as well as by the gradual return of routine testing volume to normal levels
as movement and other restrictions have been lifted.

Prompt and accurate diagnostic testing improves the quality of patient care and reduces the overall cost of healthcare. As
a result, the governments in most of the markets in which we operate, including France, Belgium and Luxembourg (which
fund a significant proportion of the value of testing in their respective countries including approximately 70% for France
and between 70% and 100% for Belgium) have promoted the use of medical testing as preventive care, which has led to
growth in demand for medical lab testing generally. Due to the high volume of testing needs and limited testing capacity
of the public sector, public hospital laboratories have increasingly outsourced testing to private providers. The fiscal
constraints of the public sector further contribute to the private sector’s continued growth to meet the increasing demand.
In Spain, private insurers (who cover approximately 85% of the cost of tests generated by private labs) are also following
the trend of more preventative testing leading to an increase in the number of markers tested per test.

Net sales of laboratory companies in France, Belgium and Luxembourg are subject to annual budgets established in advance
through industry-wide agreements with regulatory authorities, which set the prices for routine medical testing in advance.
For example, in France, pursuant to a triennial agreement in March 2020 with medical biologists’ labor unions (the
“Current Triennial Plan”), the annual budget growth for medical lab tests is set for three years, and allows an increase of
up to 0.40% in 2020, 0.50% in 2021 and 0.60% in 2022, excluding COVID-19 related tests. In Belgium, prices of routine
tests in the private medical laboratory testing market in Belgium are set by the national healthcare regulatory body,
RIZIV/INAMI, and are revised at least on an annual basis and historically have increased by approximately 1% per annum
since 2010, with national social welfare agency contributions roughly tracking inflation and patient contribution levels
remaining stable. In Luxembourg, prices are set by the Ministry of Health and the national insurance scheme (Caisse
_Nationale de Santé). In 2018, a new framework was put in place that included a quotation grid setting out the tests that are_
eligible for CNS payments, as well as their respective prices. This was followed by price increases in 2019 (2.50% in
January 2019 and 5.00% in May 2019) that led, together with increased testing volumes in 2019 and 2020, to CNS spending
approximately €80 million in 2019 (which was a 23% increase compared to 2018) and €106 million in 2020 (which was a
32.5% increase compared to 2019). As a result, certain variables that contribute to our net sales, including pricing, are
somewhat predictable. These annual budgets set a baseline, with prices increasing or decreasing depending on how the
market value of laboratory testing compares to the annual budgets. In addition to the government-regulated price, in
Belgium we have the option to charge the patient an additional amount, typically up to 10% of the government-regulated
price. Although these agreements create significant pricing pressure, they also protect our industry from unforeseen
external shocks, because they provide an additional budget for a predetermined level of overall market growth and to meet
the increased need for tests during an exceptional event.

The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates how this system works. Regulatory authorities in France, Belgium and Luxembourg
provided an additional budget for COVID-19-related tests separate from its annual budget for lab testing. However, there
was also decrease in routine medical lab testing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite recent amendments to the reimbursement framework in France that precludes reimbursement for most
unvaccinated adults, see “Regulation–France–Pricing and Reimbursement”, we expect that the increased demand for
COVID-19-related testing activity (such as polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) and serology testing), which had not
previously contributed to the market value of traditional medical laboratory testing services, will continue to provide
additional upside to lab operators in the short term. In the long-term, the incremental PCR testing capacity we have
established can be used for tests to detect non-COVID-19-related infectious diseases, such as microbiology tests, which
we expect will mitigate future decreases in PCR testing volumes for COVID-19. We also expect routine testing volumes
to increase from greater public familiarity with diagnostic testing and its benefits, as well as the emergence of new tests in
the “routine” segment of the market. Moreover, the increased public awareness of the central importance of medical
laboratory testing services resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may benefit medical laboratory testing providers in
future price negotiations with the relevant regulatory authorities. We believe we are well placed to benefit from these
trends, because we were amongst the first private European testing providers to invest in the PCR testing equipment and


-----

to have provided PCR testing in our French markets. In addition, our Luxembourg subsidiary Les Laboratoires Réunis,
acquired in July 2021, has been the sole private testing provider chosen by the Government to support its first phase of
large scale testing.

For a further discussion of our markets and their underlying competitive dynamics, see “Industry”.

**_Leading European market position driving strong historical growth and EBITDA margin_**

We believe we are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in our core markets of France and
Belgium. In addition, we entered the Spanish and Luxembourg markets through acquisition in 2021 and believe we are
already are the second largest laboratory group in Luxembourg based on net sales. For the twelve months ended June 30,
2021, we generated net sales of €2,107.5 million, including net sales of €1,915.4 million in France and €180.1 million of
net sales in Belgium through the Medina Group, which we acquired in October 2020. As a large incumbent operator in all
of our markets, we are able to leverage significant economies of scale both (i) financially, benefitting from strong
negotiating positions with key suppliers and (ii) operationally, through our ability to react quickly and at scale to respond
to regulatory or other changes, such as our rapid roll-out of COVID-19-related PCR testing capabilities at the start of the
pandemic. These attributes have allowed us to deliver a competitive Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19
impact) margin of 35.2% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

Through our large-scale and successful consolidation of smaller operators, we have developed a network of approximately
1,605 collection sites across Europe with the capacity to deliver up to 176,500 tests per day as of September 2021.
Moreover, we have historically experienced very low churn among our medical biologists. Biologists at acquired
laboratories are incentivized to remain within our Group following the acquisition and integration of targets due to a
combination of financial, structural and cultural factors, such as our profit sharing system, the decentralized management
of each laboratory site, which leverages centralized regional technical platform capabilities to achieve cost savings, and
the fact that we are owned and managed by Dr. Stéphane Eimer, a medical biologist. This low churn has historically
provided us with substantial institutional knowledge at both the local and regional levels, promoting continuity and
operational efficiency as new targets are integrated into our Group’s network on an ongoing basis.

We have executed our consolidation strategy with discipline and speed, having successfully integrated 57 acquisitions
since 2015. For example, the 2020 Acquisitions and acquisitions made in 2019 (including (Unilians Biogroup, Laborizon
and Medina) have contributed an increase of €950.2 million to our net sales in the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.
The chart below sets forth the growth in the number of our collection sites since 2015.

Our consolidation strategy has allowed us to generate, on a compounded basis, an annual net sales growth rate of over 74%
and an annual pro forma adjusted EBITDA growth rate of over 83% from 2015 to 2020, demonstrating the effectiveness
of scale in enhancing our financial performance. A key factor in ensuring uplifts in EBITDA margins are effectively


-----

extracted from new acquisitions is our ability to quickly manage staff costs (mainly by substituting part of the cash
compensation of biologists at the newly acquired laboratory with equity), supplier costs (through application of the terms
of our existing framework agreements immediately after closing and post-acquisition reagent price renegotiations with
suppliers benefiting from the Group’s increased scale) and other operating costs of target labs in order to rapidly realize
operating synergies.

**_Integrated and efficient business model with a dense network of collection sites covering a wide range of diagnostic_**
**_applications in-house_**

We believe our integrated network model allows us to benefit from significant cost savings and a high utilization rate of
our technical platforms, which leads to greater profitability. We have focused on building a series of dense networks in
each of the geographic regions we have chosen to enter, leveraging a “hub-and-spoke” network model of distributed
collection sites clustered tightly around state-of-the-art, well-invested technical platforms with, in our view, the latest and
most efficient equipment. With an average of 75 collection sites per region in France as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum (by categorizing our operating regions into a total of 11 regions in France), in contrast to a competitor
average of 30 in 2019, we are able to centralize sample analysis of a large number of collection sites around each of our
best-in-class technical platforms to achieve cost savings and optimize the utilization rate for each platform.

We have focused strategically on regions within France that exhibit attractive fundamental demographic characteristics,
such as rapidly growing or aging populations, metropolitan areas with above-average population density and relative
affluence. These areas, such as Ile-de-France, Auvergne Rhône-Alpes and the PACA regions, drive higher testing volumes
than more rural or less affluent regions and consequently enable us to operate at greater levels of efficiency with faster test
turnaround speeds and higher margins. In line with this strategy, we entered the Belgian market through our acquisition of
the Medina Group in October 2020, which is located in densely populated areas, thus enabling a high level of operational
efficiency. Moreover, the future acquisition of LLR Belgique, for which a letter of intent was signed in August 2021, will
enable us to further densify our network in Bruxelles and increase our reach to the densest areas in Wallonia. Our latest
additions in Spain and Luxembourg follow the same approach of penetrating dense areas while constituting a basis for
potential further consolidation and thus increase margins.

We cover all of the routine laboratory testing phases in-house, from initial collection of samples from patients or healthcare
providers to post-analytical biological validation and results reporting. Approximately 97% of our net sales in 2020 were
derived from our testing services that are conducted in-house. Our strong in-house analytical capabilities (including our
innovative testing automation capabilities enabled by best-in-class equipment), combined with our dense network of
collection sites located in close proximity to technical platforms (as well as to large epidemic clusters), allow us to optimize
our operations and achieve a quick turnaround of testing results with fewer staff. We estimate that we revert with test
results within 12 hours for a majority of tests. We also offer a comprehensive service across a wide scope of medical tests,
including clinical chemistry, hematology, allergy, microbiology, immunochemistry, molecular diagnostics, cytology and
fertility tests. See “Business—Our Business—Overview” for more information.

Furthermore, for our operations in France and Luxembourg in particular, we believe that our strategic focus on the B2C
routine lab segment and limited exposure to outsourced testing drive our EBITDA margin outperformance. By
concentrating on B2C routine lab testing (which generally generates a higher margin than B2B) and maintaining limited
outsourcing (which is generally more expensive than in-house testing), we benefit from greater profitability than some of
our peers that have a B2B business model and/or outsource a greater proportion of tests. We generally perform
approximately 98% of our analysis by volume in-house, and outsource only a small portion of testing to our outsourcing
partner in France, Biomnis, for certain specialized tests with low demand (and therefore less profitable to invest in resources
to conduct the tests in-house). If an outsourced test becomes sufficiently recurrent, we may decide to make an investment
and purchase or lease the necessary equipment and hire the appropriate staff to be able to perform the test in-house. See
“Business—Our Business” for more information.

Finally, our centralized procurement function and limited number of suppliers allow us to better absorb pricing pressures
and improve profitability. We generally engage only one or two suppliers per service and type of purchase, who provide
the relevant service and products nationally to our collection sites and technical platforms. This centralization helps our
group-level procurement team negotiate better terms with our reagent and equipment suppliers pursuant to master supply


-----

agreements, which also benefit our acquired targets post-acquisition. This approach allows us to achieve a competitive net
sales margin while harmonizing best practices across our network. See “Business—Our Suppliers” for more information.

**_Incumbent leadership position strengthened by significant barriers to entry_**

We believe that our competitive position is bolstered by several significant barriers to entry for private medical lab testing
market in France, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg.

We operate in a highly regulated industry with stringent, complex mandatory operating license accreditation frameworks.
These requirements can be onerous for providers without a critical scale in the market to support the resources necessary
to achieve and maintain compliance, creating an environment naturally conducive to consolidation. We are subject to
onerous licensing and certification regimes, particularly in Belgium where there is a de facto stop on the granting of new
licenses, thus making it difficult to increase the number of new licenses. We collaborate closely with regulators to stay up–
to-date with the latest regulatory developments in the markets where we operate. For our French operations in particular,
our Quality Director is also a member of COFRAC (Comité français d’accréditation), which supervises French laboratories
to ensure that they are up–to-date on regulatory requirements. Our relationship with COFRAC provides us with a significant
advantage compared to new entrants, particularly with respect to obtaining accreditation under the new accreditation
requirement pursuant to the more rigorous ISO 15189 standard. As of October 31, 2021, our laboratories and facilities in
France were 100% accredited by COFRAC under the ISO 15189 standard, and we aim to obtain accreditation under the
ISO 9001 standard by 2023. In our Belgian operations, all of our collection sites and technical platforms are accredited
under the relevant quality standards issued by Sciensano, Belgium’s Scientific Institute for Public Health. All but one of
our collection sites in Belgium have obtained the BELAC accreditation in line with the ISO 15189 standard. See
“Business—Quality Standards” for more information.

Moreover, the constraints on ownership of laboratory companies in France are burdensome to potential market entrants, in
particular overseas investors, making it more difficult to achieve scale or establish a new business. French law requires in-
house biologists to retain a majority of voting rights and, subject to certain exceptions, share capital of the subsidiaries they
own. Generally, our acquisition targets’ biologists will retain some equity interest post-acquisition. See “Business—Our
_Corporate Structure (SEL/SELAS)” and “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure” for more information._

Our “hub-and-spoke” network model further allows us to leverage economies of scale. We operate in several regions
through a combination of multiple collection sites serviced by a centralized technical platform where tests are actually
performed, which allows us to reduce our fixed costs (comprised largely of staff and facilities costs) and deliver a broad
range of testing services at a lower cost per unit than a new entrant is likely to be able to achieve. This scale also gives us
negotiating power to procure reagents and equipment on more advantageous terms, as well as in M&A processes.

Further, our industry know-how and deep scientific expertise, combined with our dense network of collection sites, allow
us to deliver diagnostic testing services quickly and accurately at the convenience of the customers. Convenience (including
proximity for individual patients, our main customers in France and Luxembourg), fast turnaround and quality of testing
results are important factors for patients and doctors (our main customers in Belgium) in selecting laboratories. As an
incumbent already equipped with experienced biologists across multiple regions and state-of-the-art technical platforms
with the latest technology that can handle large testing volumes efficiently, we have been able to promptly deliver testing
results for a broad range of routine lab tests.

Our successful track record and our strong reputation also act as powerful barriers to entry. Developing a reputation for
convenience and quality takes time to build, and we believe Biogroup’s strong reputation (including the strength of our
subsidiaries’ reputations, such as Medina Group) in diagnostic services in our markets enables us to attract customers, staff
and potential acquisition targets over competitors, ensuring that our testing volumes, skill and technical capabilities are
maintained and grow over time. The high-volume nature of the routine laboratory testing business requires substantial
managerial and organizational competence to implement high quality standards throughout the network. Our decentralized
management structure allows for best practices to be identified based on local experience, while our scale and infrastructure
allow for best practices to be shared and implemented across the Group. Our fast turnaround in delivering test results and
the convenience of the proximity of testing sites to patients, due to our existing dense network in the regions we operate,
also provide a significant advantage over new entrants. Moreover, for our Belgian operations, we believe that our


-----

commitment to building and maintaining relationships with doctors, is also integral to continuing to grow our market share.
Doctors tend to return to their existing preferred laboratory services provider as a one-stop shop for all of the analyses they
need for their patients, and our existing relationship with these customers makes it more difficult for entrants to penetrate.
In Spain where private insurers cover approximately 85% of the cost of tests realized by private labs, we have invested in
Analiza alongside leading Spanish insurer ASISA. As the 2[nd] largest Group in Spain in terms of revenue, based on
management estimates (when including Analiza in Spain, whose results are not currently consolidated in the Group’s
financial statements), our concentrated presence in the four largest autonomous regions by inhabitants and our critical size
puts us in a position to be a reference partner for private insurers and large private hospitals externalizing their tests. Lastly,
our profile has increased significantly as a result of our COVID-19 testing response due in part to increased media coverage,
which will be difficult for other entrants to establish in the short-term.

**_Established consolidation strategy with disciplined acquisition criteria_**

We have a strong track record as a preeminent consolidator in the French diagnostic testing space. More recently,
capitalizing on our French leadership position, we have successfully entered dynamic new markets with acquisitions in
Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain. Through 57 acquisitions since 2015, we have demonstrated an ability to consistently
deliver on forecast synergies and effectively integrate newly acquired laboratories with speed and efficiency. We maintain
a proven and established M&A policy, drawing on the experience and track record of our senior leadership team to facilitate
rapid decision making through a standardized M&A process.

The consolidation strategy that we have pursued since 2015 has been a balance of speed with discipline. We have deployed
a tactical roll-up approach on a region-by-region basis, focusing on establishing technical platform hubs in new,
strategically attractive geographic regions meeting certain criteria (including the demographic factors described above),
balanced with smaller bolt-on acquisitions to create density around the technical platform and ensure maximization of
operating efficiency. Our decentralized management model also allows us to leverage our local management’s knowledge
and relationships in the regions in which we operate to source potential acquisitions and optimize post-acquisition
integration measures, such as opening new collection sites in the best locations based on their local knowledge and
harmonization of our network. We also benefit from their existing relationship with local governmental bodies and regional
health agencies.

The potential for synergies and cost savings with our existing technical platform and laboratory network is an important
criteria for our selection of targets for future acquisitions. We have a successful track record of achieving synergies and
cost savings due in part to our systematic approach of promptly integrating targets into our centralized framework
agreements, the majority of which we are able to achieve between the first day following the closing of the acquisition and
within a few weeks thereafter. For example, our acquisitions of Bioesterel in December 2018, Biolittoral in June 2019 and
Laborizon in July 2020 resulted in EBITDA margin increases which exceeded our initial target margin. See “Business—
_Our Growth through Acquisitions” for more information on the increases in EBITDA margin. We have our targets accede_
to our supplier master agreements as soon as possible post-acquisition, which allows the targets to benefit from our existing
competitive price and fee arrangements soon after an acquisition has been completed. We also selectively conduct certain
tests previously outsourced by the target in-house, outsourcing those that remain to Biomnis benefitting from our existing
contractual outsourcing arrangements at a competitive margin. See “Business—Our Growth through Acquisitions” for more
information.

In addition, we believe that the French regulatory regime governing the ownership of laboratory companies aligns the
interests of our Group and our targets and minimizes churn of senior-level specialized biologists at the target level. The
biologists’ retention of an equity stake at the target level also prevents disruption of the target’s business post-acquisition
and facilitates the post-acquisition integration process.

Over the past two years, we have expanded outside of France by investing in companies offering leading market positions
and competitive EBITDA margins relative to their local markets, entering Belgium in 2020 and Spain and Luxembourg in
2021. Following the development strategy we have successfully deployed in France, we are now further densifying and
expanding our network in Belgium with the acquisition of LLR Belgique, which is expected to close in November 2021.
In Spain, notably where private insurers cover the majority of the test costs, we have sought to align our interests with
leading insurer ASISA by taking a participation in Analiza alongside them. Our Spanish presence was further enhanced


-----

with our acquisition of Cerba Internacional in October 2021. We had significant other acquisition activity in 2021 in France.
In March, we acquired Labo Sambourg and Mayo Bio. In April, we acquired Biocéliande. In July, we acquired LLR
Luxembourg, Alphabio, Bio Sites, Viollet-Belmont and Oriade Noviale. In October, we acquired Bio-Santis and Medilys.
In evaluating transactions, we seek to benchmark pricing against prevailing market conditions at the time, while taking into
account the size and strategic significance of any given acquisition. When assessing a potential target, we generally consider
those within a range of applicable EBITDA multiples which depends on the size of the target’s business. With smaller
targets, we pursue acquisitions at lower EBITDA multiples, whereas for larger targets, we would consider paying a higher
EBITDA multiple.

**_Strong, resilient financial performance bolstered by high margins and strong cash flow generation_**

We have a strong track record of growth, with our annual pro forma revenue growth growing over 60% from 2015 to 2019.
From 2019 to 2020, our annual revenue has grown by 111.7% including COVID-19 impact for the year ended December
31, 2020 and 33.1% excluding COVID-19 impact for the year ended December 31, 2020. Even pre-COVID-19, from 2018
to 2019, we have generated organic net sales growth of 2% in France and 3-4% in Belgium from 2010 to 2018, exceeding
that of the overall market (approximately 0.8% from 2014 to 2019 in France and 2-3% from 2010 to 2018 in Belgium),
due in part to our structural exposure to regions exhibiting greater organic growth in testing volumes. More recently, our
French sales have organically grown by over 59% for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the six months
ended June 30, 2020.

Our above-market organic growth trajectory has been supported by our strategy of selectively investing in geographic
regions that exhibit attractive demographic characteristics, such as rapidly growing or aging populations, metropolitan
areas with above-average population density and relative affluence. Within each of the geographic regions we have chosen
to enter, we have built a dense network of collection sites which leverage centralized regional technical platform
capabilities to achieve cost savings. Our scale and infrastructure allow us to achieve economies of scale in negotiating with
suppliers, while allowing us to survey a broad array of best practices which are adopted across the Group.

Our efficient operational approach has allowed us to generate Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact)
of €468.7 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 and a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19
impact) margin of 35.2% during the same time period, which we believe to have outperformed our peers in our core
markets.

Our business has maintained stable margins and cash conversion over a number of years, despite significant growth. Our
Adjusted EBITDA margins were 29.2%, 29.6% and 38.0% for the years ended December 31, 2018 2019 and 2020,
respectively. Our adjusted free cash flow, which we calculate as Adjusted EBITDA less changes in net working capital
and net capital expenditure, was €73.0 million, €166.0 million, €402.3 million and €553.0 million for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. Our cash flow performance
was also strong, with net cash flow from operating activities representing 74% and 65% of our EBITDA for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020 respectively, supported notably by our limited capital expenditures profile and reduced
working capital requirements. Our cash flow conversion ratio, which we calculate as our adjusted free cash flow as a
percentage of Adjusted EBITDA, was 71.6%, 92.2%, 82.2% and 98.5% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and
2020 and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively.

In addition, we typically do not acquire any diagnostic instrumentation (except for PCR testing equipment, which we
purchased in 2020 in response to increasing demand due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic) and lease our
equipment from our reagent suppliers. See “Business—Our Suppliers” for more information. This approach benefits us by
limiting ongoing maintenance capital expenditures.

**_Highly experienced and agile management team with an entrepreneurial spirit supported by committed shareholders_**
**_and investors_**

We have an experienced management team with substantial scientific and commercial experience in the diagnostic testing
sector. Our majority shareholder, Chairman and CEO, Dr. Stéphane Eimer, is a trained pharmacist and medical biologist
who founded Laboratoire Eimer in 1998 and maintains control over our operations.


-----

Our senior leadership and culture (driven by a medical biologist instead of a financial sponsor) distinguishes us from our
competitors. Dr. Eimer’s strategic vision and long and successful track record of consolidation have helped drive our
growth. His knowledge and reputation among other biologists in the industry have historically been an important
differentiator during our M&A processes, compared with certain sponsor-backed peers. Dr. Eimer’s deep and long-standing
relationships with suppliers allow us to benefit from competitive margins under our supply agreements. For more
information about our management, see “Management”. Dr. Eimer’s strategy is also to cultivate strong management teams
at the local level. Our network of regional management teams, incentivized with minority shareholdings in their respective
laboratories, further provide strength and depth of experience at each level of the Group and ensure high quality and
consistency of operational initiatives across our Group. We believe that our corporate infrastructure provides the necessary
framework for improving performance and sharing best practices across our network. Our senior and regional management
structure has allowed us to retain our culture as a scientifically-led organization and promote our reputation as the provider
of choice in the routine outpatient diagnostic testing market in Europe.

Our de-centralized governance structure across our network also allows us to make agile investment decisions, thereby
enabling us to achieve a high rate of successful completed acquisitions. This agility has been recently demonstrated in our
response to the emergence of COVID-19, where our management team ramped up the installation of PCR testing
equipment, securing a cornerstone position in the provision of testing in France and an approximate 20% market share of
all COVID-19 tests in France (public and private) and approximately 35% market share in the private MLT PCR testing
market as of June 30, 2021. We have performed more than 8.9 million PCR tests and 377,000 serological tests for the 6
months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 7.4 million of PCR tests and 821,000 serological tests performed for the year
ended December 31, 2020 and COVID-19 tests revenue accounted for 37.1% of our total sales for the year ended December
30, 2020. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic until September, 2021, we performed a total of more than 18.9
million PCR tests and 1.1 million serology tests for COVID-19 in France (including tests performed by companies acquired
in 2020 prior to their acquisition date), and as of the same date, we had performed 2.3 million PCR tests and 261 thousand
serology tests in Belgium. The charts below show the number of COVID-19 PCR tests performed in France and Belgium,
together with the percentage performed by Biogroup, from May 2020 through September 2021.

Note: (1) The available data on the number of COVID tests performed in Belgium do not detail the share of PCR and antigen tests

Our agility and capacity to monitor opportunities has also been demonstrated by our successful establishment of COVID-
19-testing in London, where we have also become a market leader in private COVID-19 testing with seven sites in operation
as of the end of June 30, 2021.

Moreover, we are supported by blue-chip institutional investors who share the long-term strategic objectives of the
management team and bring substantial experience in operating in the healthcare sector. We maintain regular
communication with our key institutional investors, CDPQ, ICG and Straco, who have approval rights with respect to
external acquisitions and financings that exceed a certain level. See “Principal Shareholders, Investors and Related Party
_Transactions—Key Institutional Investors”._

**Our Strategy**

**_Selectively pursue acquisitions and become a pan-European leader in the medical laboratory testing space_**

We believe we are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in France and in Belgium, operating
in seven regions in France, one region in Belgium, and in six other regions abroad (including the United Kingdom,
Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Brazil). We entered the Spanish and Luxembourg markets through
acquisition in 2021 and believe we are already the second largest laboratory group in Luxembourg based on net sales. The
laboratory testing markets in our markets remain fragmented, and we regularly identify numerous near and medium term
potential consolidation opportunities in both markets. We therefore plan to continue expanding our footprint within all of
these regions through acquisitions and increasing the density of collection sites serving existing and additional technical
platforms, reinforcing our “hub-and-spoke” network model.

We expect acquisitions in the regions in which we are already present to be primarily small- and mid-sized bolt-on
acquisitions that can quickly and effectively be integrated into our existing network infrastructure to realize significant
operating synergies and cost savings at these sites. We will closely appraise potential targets based on their location relative
to our existing facilities, as well as other factors, including customer accessibility. We will prioritize sites that we believe
will help drive testing volume growth for our technical platforms and further increase our market share. We will also
leverage our local medical biologists’ knowledge of the market and their relationships with the management of potential
targets. We aim to finance such bolt-on acquisitions with our organic free cash flow.

We also intend to expand into new regions in our markets, particularly in the latest geographies we have established, i.e.
in Spain and to a lesser extent in Luxembourg, which fit specific demographic criteria that we believe will drive increasing
testing volumes, such as regions with rapidly growing or aging populations, metropolitan areas with above-average


-----

population density and relative affluence. Acquisitions in new regions are likely to focus on mid-sized to larger targets that
we believe will provide us with sufficient scale and both local collection sites and technical platforms. Once such
acquisitions are completed and our operations are integrated, we may seek to further consolidate our position and enhance
network density through smaller bolt-on acquisitions.

Moreover, we continue to selectively assess potential acquisition opportunities in other European markets which we believe
present attractive demographic characteristics and opportunities to become a pan-European leading laboratory testing
provider by leveraging our experience in our core markets. Acquisitions in new markets are likely to be mid- to large-size
transactions.

**_Drive organic volume growth across our markets and raise brand recognition_**

Our goal is to continue delivering organic growth superior to the growth of the markets in which we operate. We intend to
achieve this through our continued focus on operational excellence and improved customer experience and satisfaction. In
particular, we believe that the continued development of our established laboratory network will further foster successful
organic growth and help us to maintain and expand on the established relationships we hold with key stakeholders across
the industry.

We continue to monitor our geographic footprint closely to ensure that our portfolio is distributed in accordance with our
strategic criteria. Areas of higher density, aging population and affluence will be targeted for greater investment and
improvement, with a particular focus on sites offering enhanced customer convenience and other characteristics that will
help continue to drive volume growth.

We further intend to remain alert to changing trends in testing patterns and ready to respond quickly where these trends are
identified. We remain open to the selective expansion of our testing portfolio within our wider strategy of maintaining a
primary focus on routine B2C testing. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, there is potential for a step-change in public
attitudes toward diagnostic testing and, as demonstrated by our initial reaction to the emergence of the virus, we are able
to respond quickly as these trends are identified to ensure that we continue to provide a comprehensive end-to-end
diagnostic testing service.

Finally, our profile has increased significantly as a result of our COVID-19 testing response and we plan to use this as a
platform to further develop customer awareness, establish solid branding and reputation and promote public understanding
of us and our service offering to drive additional B2C volumes.

**_Continue to deliver operating efficiencies and maintain best-in-class margins_**

We will continue to maintain our established growth trajectory in line with our historical acquisitions and leverage the
economies of scale that historical and future acquisitions can deliver. Our scale is our core differentiator in our core markets
and the source of our primary competitive advantage over smaller peers. Our size allows us to benefit from operational and
supply chain efficiencies and to survey a broad landscape for best practices, which we can then benchmark and adopt across
our network. Our market leadership and culture (driven by a medical biologist controlling ownership instead of a financial
investor) also helps us attract and retain high quality staff and serves as a competitive differentiator in M&A processes.

We will continue to enhance our internal logistical and procurement networks and aim to operate as efficiently as possible
in the delivery of our services. Our strategy is to use a limited number of suppliers per service and type of purchase for the
Group. This selection process allows us to choose the best supplier for each type of analysis and to obtain optimized
purchasing conditions through economies of scale. Our procurement partner framework agreements will be revisited from
time to time to ensure they continue bringing the best value for our Group as we continue to grow in scale, and our logistical
arrangements will respond to the increasing scope of our network to ensure that our operating and financial performance
is maintained.

We will continue our strategy of maximizing our operational efficiency, through our dense networks of collection sites
located in close proximity to technical platforms, which enable us to centralize our testing equipment and professionals at
technical platforms, reduce our overhead costs and, consequently, maintain our high EBITDA margin. Moreover, we will


-----

maintain our focus on providing customers with convenience in terms of proximity to our collection sites, fast and accurate
testing results (we estimate that we revert with test results within 12 hours for a majority of tests) and flexible opening
hours. We will also continue to minimize our logistics costs through our hub-and-spoke model, which enables us to achieve
quick turnaround of testing results.

Although we anticipate our net sales to experience downward pressure in the near term as a result of regulatory pricing
pressure in our markets, we have a long track record and significant experience in managing pricing pressure and we remain
confident that our above-market organic volume growth trajectory and consistent operating cost control will continue to
mitigate this to deliver stable or near-stable EBITDA margins and free cash flow in the short to medium term. By leveraging
our dense network, strategically placed in metropolitan areas with higher demand for medical testing due to their
demographics, we expect to sustain sufficient volume growth with low staff costs, allowing us to resist against pricing
pressure in the future.

In line with our historical acquisitions, we will focus on adding scale without reducing post-synergy and cost savings
EBITDA margins for future acquisitions. We will aim to maintain a track record of meeting or exceeding forecast synergies
and cost savings with our future acquisitions, by implementing agile integration strategies and adopting efficiency measures
between the first day of integration and within a few weeks from closing.

**_Encourage the sharing of best practices internally to provide the highest quality service_**

As one of the market-leading providers of testing services, we have developed a reputation for operational excellence. One
of our key differentiators is that our ownership and management structure fosters our culture as a scientifically-led
organization that promotes the sharing of best practices within our Group. Our corporate infrastructure provides the
necessary framework for sharing best practices across our network, through “best practice” committees organized by topic
and supervised by our Quality department, to ensure such practices are benchmarked and adopted across our network. In
so doing, we aim to uniformly promote new investments in technologies and logistical innovation.

We constantly monitor and aim to improve our systems and processes, and plan to develop and upgrade our operating and
diagnostic systems to maintain high quality standards and deliver increased operational excellence and efficiency. For
example, we are actively exploring how increased automation can be incorporated into the end-to-end testing process and,
through our “best practice” committees, we plan to establish, benchmark and then implement new operating standards for
roll-out across our Group. These committees are also expected to build on the experience, including in crisis management
and operational optimization, we gained during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that we are best prepared
to respond to other potential challenges in the future. For example, we have benefited from sharing knowledge through
these committees on the best performing PCR testing equipment, as well as brand selection and alternative sourcing options
for reagents, masks and swabs, which has enhanced our ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and other future
pandemics or similar crises.

**The Transactions**

**Recent Acquisitions**

In July 2020, we acquired Laborizon (the “Laborizon Acquisition”), a network of private medical analysis laboratories
based in Grand Ouest (Western France).

On October 30, 2020, we acquired seven companies of Medina Group (“Medina Acquisition”), which is the leading
laboratory operator in Belgium in terms of net sales, to expand our operations to the Belgian medical lab testing market.
The Medina Acquisition was in part financed by ICG, one of our investors, through an equity contribution. In addition,
Straco, which previously owned the Medina Group, has since become one of our investors by reinvesting part of the
proceeds from the Medina Acquisition in our Group.

See “Principal Shareholders, Investors and Related Party Transactions” for more information on our investors.

We have also continued to actively acquire laboratory companies in the French market:

        - On March 18, 2021, we acquired Biologie Médicale Sambourg (“Labo Sambourg”) and on March 26, 2021, we
acquired Mayo Bio.

        - On April 2, 2021, we acquired Laboratoire de Biologie Médicale Biocéliande (“Biocéliande”) (together with the
acquisitions of Labo Sambourg and Mayo Bio, the “2021 H1 Acquisitions”).

        - On July 1, 2021, we acquired Alphabio (“Alphabio”) and LBM Viollet-Belmont (“Viollet-Belmont”) and Oriade
Noviale (the “Oriade-Noviale Acquisition”) on the 30th of the month.

        - On July 8, 2021 we acquired Bio Sites.

        - On October 1, 2021 we acquired Bio-Santis.

In addition, on July 1, 2021, we acquired 51% of the share capital of Laboratoires Réunis Luxembourg (“LLR
**Luxembourg” and such acquisition, “LLR Luxembourg Acquisition”) whose activities comprise blood sampling,**
analysis, nursing care as well as prevention and health promotion. It is specialized in genetics, genomics and molecular
diagnosis of infectious diseases and has also veterinary activities. It is the second largest laboratory company in
Luxembourg, with 63 blood collection centers. We expect to acquire a further 29% of the company's capital on December
31, 2021 (in accordance with the terms of a purchase option).

Most recently, on October 15, 2021, we acquired, Cerba Internacional in Spain and 80% of a holding company with a 50%
interest in Analiza in Spain. Cerba International is a Spanish medical testing and consulting group holding a leading position
in Catalonia, with 7 laboratories across its 4 provinces and a network of 205 collection centers. The Group has a catalog of
approximately 7,000 tests. Cerba’s operations are divided into the following business lines: **Laboratory Services:**
reference and routine tests divided into 10 specialties and methodologies. Reference tests require sophisticated equipment
or specialized staff and are performed at Cerba’s main laboratory in Barcelona. Routine tests on biological samples are
performed across all laboratories. Laboratory Consulting: services primarily focused on genetic consulting provided to
private medical insurance companies.

Analiza is a Spanish group in the medical diagnostics sector with 417 sample collection centres and 43 labs and centres,
focused mainly in Madrid, Catalonia and Andalucia. The company operates several segments: medical biology,
anapathology, medical imaging (mainly radiology). It has a strong coverage in Madrid and exclusive contract with one of
the main Spanish insurers (over 400,000 insured) as well as contracts with 3 major hospitals (HLA Moncloa, H. Fuensanta
and H. Santa Elena) and approximately private and external collection centers.

On October 29, 2021, we acquired Medilys in France. Medilys is a multi-site medical biology laboratory in the Jura
department in the Bourgogne Franche-Comté region, spread over seven sites. The Company’s platform in Lons-Le-Saunier
performs all COVID-19 tests for the Bourogne-Franche-Comté laboratories associated with Medilys. Medilys generated
revenue of €23.3 million and EBITDA of €6.7 million in 2020.


-----

We expect to close the LLR Belgique Acquisition in 2021. LLR Belgique operates through two technical platforms (with
collection sites) and 48 collection sites in Wallonia and Brussels. In addition to a range of routine analyses, LLR Belgique
offers a catalogue of tests in molecular biology, genetics and preventive medicine. LLR Belgique generated revenue of
€13.6 million and EBITDA of €1.2 million in 2020.

The Medilys Acquisition and the LLR Belgique Acquisition collectively represent an approximately €104 million
enterprise value.

**Recent Divestments**

As part of the acquisition of the Laborizon group, CAB sold Sèvre Biologie in February 2021 to comply with a decision
of the French Competition Authority for €10 million. As a part of the Unilians Biogroup Acquisition, we sold seven
Unilians/Dyomedea sites also to comply with a decision of the French Competition Authority for €14.3 million.

Additionally, as part of the acquisition of Oriade-Noviale, we will sell on November 30, 2021 eight offices (sites) to
Eurofins to comply with a decision of the French Competition Authority.

**Other Recent Developments**

**_Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic_**

As a leading provider of medical laboratory testing, we believe we provide a vital service to the healthcare systems and
general public in France and Belgium during the COVID-19 pandemic to help fight against the virus.

We are working closely with French, Belgian and other government health authorities to use our PCR and serology testing
capabilities to help combat the virus. We were granted the status of critical national infrastructure in France and Belgium
by their respective governments during various lock-down periods, which allowed all of our key collection sites and
technical platforms to remain open and operational in order for us to meet the demand for our services.

The significant additional net sales from the large volume of PCR and serology tests we have performed since March 2020
in France and Belgium have resulted in strong cash generation and our increased ability to deleverage. For the twelve
months ended June 30, 2021, we generated €1,185 million of Pro Forma net sales from COVID-19-related PCR and
serology tests, accounting for 47% of the Group’s Pro Forma net sales for the same period. This also had a positive impact
on our EBITDA, with our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2021 at €1,046.6 million and 41.6%, respectively, compared to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding
COVID-19 impact) and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) margin of €468.7 million and 35.2%
for the same period. See “Summary—Other Financial Data” for more information.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, market growth in COVID-19-related tests has significantly
counterbalanced the negative impact of the temporary decrease in volumes of other routine testing. The European private
medical lab testing industry has proven its resilience, and we are currently seeing a gradual return to normal levels of
activity in the routine testing market. We are optimistic that, in the medium to long term, the easing of population
confinement measures and the return of normal economic activity in France and Belgium will result in our business fully
returning to its normal levels. Moreover, the Current Triennial Plan by the French government for the period between 2020
through 2022 provides some market growth and earnings visibility until December 2022. In Belgium, we expect the
government budget allocated to clinical biology medical testing expenditures will increase as a result of an increase in the
Fixed Sum of the medical test price by 1% and an increase in the variable portion of the medical test price calculated with
B-Value by 0.8% in 2021 compared to those budgets for 2020. The exact allocation between the private medical laboratory
testing market and the public market to be published and implemented at a later date. See “Industry” for more information
on Fixed Sum and B-Value.

Since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, Biogroup has performed approximately 18.9 million PCR tests in France and
approximately 2.6 million PCR and serological tests in Belgium, representing approximately 20% of the French national
capacity (or approximately 35% of market share in private medical lab PCR testing) and 12-15% of the Belgian national


-----

capacity of PCR testing market in 2020. We believe we benefit from higher installed capacity compared with our
competitors and an advantageous geographical footprint in and near areas where some of the largest epidemic clusters have
occurred in our markets. In France, we also benefited from higher visibility due to our fast installations of drive-in locations
and good media coverage. Additionally, thanks to our competitive hub-and-spoke network, we are able to provide a
significant proportion of PCR test results in less than 12 hours. In Belgium, we enjoy an estimated 27% share of the private
testing market for the year ended December 31, 2020 and continue to hold our historical leading position in Flanders and
benefit from high loyalty from medical practitioners.

In addition, in 2020, LLR Luxembourg was the first lab company chosen by the Luxembourg government to carry out
COVID-19 PCR tests there.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, it is not possible to accurately predict the near-, medium- or long-term impact
of COVID-19 on our business and our industry, the timing and the extent, if any, of the changes in policies on
reimbursement of COVID-19 tests and government policies in connection with the testing requirements for employees for
COVID-19 requiring proof of a negative test or vaccination to carry on certain activities remain uncertain. See “Risks
_Related to Our Industry—The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has caused severe disruptions in_
_the global economy and financial markets which could adversely affect our business”. We will continue monitoring and_
working closely with the authorities as necessary as the COVID-19 pandemic develops. See “Business – Impact of the
_COVID-19 Pandemic” for our PCR and serology testing capabilities, related reimbursement policies in our markets and_
our other COVID-19 pandemic-related initiatives.

**_Our operations in the United Kingdom_**

In December 2020, we launched PCR test services in the United Kingdom through Biogroup Laboratory Limited, a non-
wholly owned subsidiary of CAB incorporated in November 2020. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we operate
our operations in the United Kingdom through six collection sites and one technical platform, all located in London. As of
the date of this offering memorandum, we have conducted more than 469,000 PCR tests since launch in the United
Kingdom, and have conducted approximately 4,504 PCR tests per day.

**Current Trading**

Based on our preliminary results, our net sales for the two months ended August 31, 2021 increased to €394.2 million from
€202.4 million compared to the two months ended August 31, 2020, primarily due to the impact of our recent acquisitions
and the increase in PCR testing volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Based on our preliminary results, our EBITDA for the two months ended August 31, 2021 increased to €153.2 million
from €85.0 million compared to the two months ended August 31, 2020, primarily due to improved profitability resulting
from a sharp increase in our revenue, which was further supported by our ability to control costs (which are mostly fixed
in nature) and to realize synergies with respect to our recent acquisitions.

Based on our preliminary results, our cash and cash equivalents as of August 31, 2021 was €748.4 million, which increased
by €192.6 million from €555.8 million as of June 30, 2021 primarily due to the amount drawn under the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility of €220 million that was not fully utilized for the relevant Acquisitions as of August 31, 2021.

_The preliminary results presented above have not been audited, are derived from internal management accounts, are the_
_responsibility of management and are subject to our financial closing procedures. These procedures have not yet been_
_completed. While we believe these preliminary results to be reasonable, our actual results could vary and these differences_
_could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this information. In particular, results for the two_
_months ended August 31, 2021 may not be indicative of the remainder of the quarter ended September 30, 2021 or any_
_future periods. See “Forward-Looking Statements”, “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this offering memorandum for a more complete discussion of certain_
_of the factors that could affect our performance._

As of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Guarantors in

and approximately 100% of our total assets (including goodwill).

The Guarantees will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and other
certain contractual and legal limitations, and may be released under certain
circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There are
_circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under_
_which the Collateral securing the Notes and the related guarantees will be_
_released automatically without your consent or the Trustee or the Security_
_Agent obtaining your further consent”; “Limitations on Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency_
_Law Considerations”; “Description of the Notes—The Guarantees—_
_Guarantees Release”._

**Ranking of the Guarantees:** The Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

                          - be a senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under
“Description of the Notes—Security”;

                          - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future
Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated
in right of payment to such Guarantee, including Indebtedness
incurred under the Senior Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured
Notes and certain Hedging Obligations;

                          - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future
Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in
right of payment to such Guarantee;

                          - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness
or obligation of such Guarantor that is secured by property and
assets that do not secure such Guarantee, to the extent of the value
of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or
obligation; and

                          - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness
of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors,
including obligations owed to trade creditors.

The Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
including the subordination, payment blockage and standstill on
enforcement provisions thereunder, as further described under
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”.

**Security:** On the Additional Notes Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by first-
priority security interests (the “Collateral”), over the:


-----

                          - share capital and other securities of the Issuer held respectively
by Laboratoire Eimer and Biogold;

                          - share capital and other securities of Biogold held by Laboratoire
Eimer;

                          - share capital and other securities of each of Astralab, Bio Lam
LCD, BPO-Bioépine, Biomer, LBM Bioesterel, Laborizon Maine
Anjou, Unilians Biogroup, Laborizon Bretagne and Laborizon
Centre, Medisch Labo Medina BV, Macsys NV and Centrum
voor Medische Analyse BV held by the Issuer;

                          - share capital and other securities of Biosynergie held by BPO-
Bioépine;

                          - intercompany receivables owed to Laboratoire Eimer by Biogold
and other members of the Group;

                          - intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer by other members of
the Group;

                          - bank accounts of Laboratoire Eimer;

                          - intercompany receivables owed to the Guarantors by other
members of the Group;

                          - bank accounts of the Guarantors.

The Collateral that secures the Existing Senior Secured Notes and related
Guarantees and will secure the Additional Notes and related Guarantees,
also secures the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations and,
subject to the terms of the Indenture, may also secure other future
indebtedness, in each case on a _pari passu basis in accordance with the_
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. Any proceeds received upon any
enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied pro rata in
repayment of all obligations under the Notes and Guarantees, the Senior
Facilities and any other indebtedness permitted to be incurred and secured
on a _pari passu basis with the Notes and Guarantees pursuant to the_
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness”._

The Collateral may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain
defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability. For more
information on the security interests granted, see “Description of the
_Notes—Security” and for more information on potential limitations to the_
security interests, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”_
and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes”.

The security interests over the Collateral may be released under certain
circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes —There are
_circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under_
_which the Collateral securing the Notes and the related guarantees will be_
_released automatically without your consent or the Trustee or the Security_

_Agent obtaining your further consent”, “Description of Other_
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—_
_Security—Release”._

**Intercreditor Agreement ....................** Each Holder, by accepting or purchasing a Note, will be deemed to have
agreed to and be bound by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Indenture is subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and the
rights and benefits of the Holders will be limited accordingly and subject
to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, the Issuer’s
obligations in respect of the Notes may be released in certain
circumstances. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”, and “Description
_of the Notes—Security”._

**Additional Amounts ...........................** All payments by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (or any
surviving entity) under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee will
be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for or on
account of, any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, withholding or
other governmental charges (including, without limitation, penalties,
interest and other similar liabilities related thereto) of whatever nature,
unless required by law. If any withholding or deduction for or on account
of any taxes imposed by any relevant taxing jurisdiction is required, the
Issuer, the Guarantor or surviving entity, as the case may be, will pay such
additional amounts as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount
received by each holder of the Notes after such withholding or deduction
will be not less than the amount the holder would have received if such
taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted, subject to certain
exceptions. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes/Additional
_Amounts”._

**Optional Redemption .........................** Prior to February 1, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all, or from time to time
a portion of, the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of such Notes plus the applicable “make whole” premium set forth
in this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

Prior to February 1, 2024, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions
redeem up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Notes using the
net proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to
103.375% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption; provided that at
least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains
outstanding after the redemption, and the redemption occurs within 180
days after the closing of such equity offering.

Prior to February 1, 2024, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the original
principal amount of the Notes during each 12 month period commencing
with the Original Issue Date at a redemption price equal to 103% of the
principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any.

On or after February 1, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the
Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum
under the caption “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption” plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date.

See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption”.


-----

**Optional** **Redemption** **on** **Certain** In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less

**Tender Offers ...................................** than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly

tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer,
or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases
all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the
Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that
remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a
price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes. See
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption—Optional Redemption
_upon Certain Tender Offers”._

**Optional Redemption for Taxation** In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may

**Reasons .............................................** redeem the Notes, in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption

price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See
“Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”.

**Change of Control ..............................** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control”,
the Issuer is required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a
purchase price in cash of 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date
of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. However, a change of control
with respect to the Notes will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified
consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such
event. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”.

**Certain Covenants: .............................** The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability
of each of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (as applicable) to:

                          - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain preferred
stock;

                          - make certain payments, including dividends and other
distributions, with respect to outstanding share capital;

                          - make certain investments or loans, including participating in joint
ventures;

                          - repay or redeem subordinated debt or share capital;

                          - create or incur or permit to exist certain liens;

                          - impose restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends
or make other payments;

                          - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including shares of any of our
restricted subsidiaries;

of our assets or all of the assets of certain subsidiaries within the
Group;

                          - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and


-----

                          - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes.

Laboratoire Eimer and Biogold, each in its capacity as a Guarantor and
third-party security provider, respectively, with respect to the Notes, will
be subject to limitations on engaging in certain activities under holding
company covenants under the Indenture.

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for as long as the Notes
achieve and maintain investment-grade ratings. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of_
_Investment Grade Status”._

Each of these covenants is subject to a number of important limitations and
exceptions as described under “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants”._

with OID equal to or exceeding a statutorily defined de minimis amount, a
holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation would be required to include
the OID in gross income as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as the OID accrues on a constant yield basis, in advance of the
receipt of cash payments that correspond to that income and regardless of
whether such holder is a cash or accrual method taxpayer. See ‘‘Tax
_Considerations - Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”._

**Notice to Investors ..............................** The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered
under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction
and may not be offered or sold, except pursuant to an exemption from, or
in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act. We have not agreed to, or otherwise undertaken to, register
the Notes (including by way of an exchange offer). See “Transfer
_Restrictions”._

**No Established Market .......................** The Additional Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
established trading market. Although the Initial Purchasers have informed
us that they intend to make a market in the Additional Notes, they are not
obligated to do so and they may discontinue market-making at any time
without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for
the Additional Notes will develop or be maintained.

**Listing ..................................................** Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission
to deal in the Additional Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There
can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the

such listing will be maintained.

(1) Represents net sales as further adjusted for the full year effect on our net sales from the companies we acquired since July 1, 2020, as if such
acquisition had been completed on January 1 of the financial year in which they were acquired (January 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021, as the
case may be) and excluding divested sites.

(2) Net capital expenditures represent acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets net of disposals of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets and excluding acquisitions of businesses.

(3) Net capital expenditures margin, expressed as a percentage, is calculated as (i) net capital expenditures divided by (ii) total net sales.

(4) Gross margin, expressed as a percentage, is calculated as (i) total net sales less consumption of materials and supplies, divided by (ii) total net
sales.

(5) EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, represents operating income/ (loss)
plus depreciation and amortization expenses. The income statement line item net change in depreciation and amortization expenses include,
among others, provisions for operational risks, disputes, pensions, bad debt, overdue receivables and depreciation of tangible assets.

(6) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) are not
measurements of financial performance under French GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating
performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with French GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) as presented in this offering memorandum may
differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and differ from “Consolidated EBITDA”
contained in the sections “Description of the Notes” of this offering memorandum and in the Indenture. We present EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) for informational purposes only.
This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the acquisitions or other transactions for which an
adjustment is made occurred at the dates indicated. There is no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will
not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The calculations for Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) are based on various assumptions (including the successful
implementation of certain initiatives), management estimates and the unaudited management accounts of the acquired businesses. These
amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information
is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations
of the acquired businesses or other transactions for the periods presented, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or
the other financial information included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision.
We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact)
because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt. EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) have limitations as analytical tools
and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under French GAAP. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information”.

(a) Represents the reversal of provisions for doubtful accounts, which are non-cash items that we consider similar to depreciation and amortization.

(b) Represents the non-utilization fee for the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, which we believe to be a non-recurring finance cost. The fee was
recorded as operating expense in accordance with French GAAP, but has been reclassified as it is related to our financing costs.

(c) Represents remaining transactional costs associated with certain acquisitions (such as advisory and legal fees), which we believe to be non-
recurring costs that should have been categorized as non-recurring costs in connection with the acquisitions we have made in 2018, 2019 and
2020, respectively. See “Business—Our History” for more information on major acquisitions we have completed during the respective periods.

(d) Represents a reduction in net sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 due to a temporary reduction of 7.4% imposed by the French social
security office in the prices for substantially all of the clinical tests we performed in France from November 2018. This temporary price
reduction was reversed in December 2018. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The prices we may charge in our markets are
_dependent on prices set by governments. Efforts to reduce government spending on healthcare and diagnostic testing may adversely affect_
_our business.”_

(e) Represents research and development (R&D) tax credit recorded as a reduction of tax expense in accordance with French GAAP, which has
been reclassified.

(f) Represents tax costs incurred in connection with French value added business tax (CVAE (cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des entreprises)),
which would have been classified as an income tax under IFRS.

(g) Represents change in subcontractor rebates granted, which is applied retroactively to our historical perimeter.

(h) Represents deconsolidation of operations of CBM25 from our consolidated financial statements. As of December 1, 2020, we no longer
exercise de facto control over CBM25 and have therefore deconsolidated the operations of CBM25 from our consolidated financial statements.
The consideration paid for the acquisition of CBM25 will be recorded as a claim against the CBM25 Sellers on our consolidated balance sheet
going forward. See “Business—Legal Proceedings” for more information.

(i) Represents the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of the companies that we acquired between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 on an annual
run-rate basis, as if the acquisitions had taken place on July 1, 2020.

(i) the €3.8 million run rate EBITDA contribution of Unilians Biogroup (formerly known as Dyomedea-Neolab, into which Unilians,
then the parent entity of Dyomedea-Neolab, merged on June 1, 2021) in connection with the Unilians Biogroup Acquisition;

(ii) the €3.6 million run rate EBITDA contribution of Laborizon in connection with the Laborizon Acquisition; and

(iii) the €14.3 million run rate EBITDA contribution of Medina Group in connection with the Medina Acquisition.


-----

(j) Represents the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of the companies that we acquired between January 1, 2021 and the date of this offering
memorandum on an annual run-rate basis, including (for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021), which correspond to €79.0 million of pro
forma run rate adjustments netted with €7.3 million related to the contribution of Biogroup Laboratory UK which exclusively performs
COVID-19 tests in London and €32.7 million of COVID-19 impact on 2021 Acquisitions. Contributions to EBITDA include:

(i) the €6.7 million run rate EBITDA contribution of Medilys in connection with the Medilys Acquisition; including a contribution of
the a COVID-19 impact of €2.9 million. In addition, run rate synergies are accounted for €1.6 million on an annual run-rate basis
for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

(ii) the €23.7 million run rate EBITDA contribution of Oriade-Noviale in connection with the Oriade-Noviale Acquisition;

(iii) the €22.4 million run rate EBITDA contribution of LLR Luxembourg in connection with the LLR Luxembourg Acquisition;

(iv) the €26.2 million run rate EBITDA contribution of other companies acquired by us during the period, including the 2021 H1
Acquisitions and our acquisitions of Alphabio (which alone accounted for a run rate EBITDA contribution of €7.3 million), Viollet
Belmont, Biosites, Bio-Santis, and Cerba Internacional (which alone accounted for a run rate EBITDA of €8.4 million)
(collectively, the “Other 2021 Acquisitions”). Analiza was also acquired in 2021, but is not consolidated in the Group’s financial
results.

(k) Represents cost savings and synergies and general efficiency improvements, each on an annual run-rate basis, that have not been implemented
as of June 30, 2021, including, as applicable for the relevant Acquisition: non-recurring expenses relating to the restatement and streamlining
of processes and overhead reductions, including as a result of purchasing efficiencies, streamlining of processes by integrating acquired
businesses into our hub-and-spoke technical platforms and overhead reductions, staff departures, impacts of new or loss of clinical contract,
including as a result of purchasing efficiencies, biologists retirements and departures, changes in biologist remuneration, management fees,
savings on reagent supplies expenses, and subcontracted specialized testing, a discount rate on subcontracted specialized testing, and
reinsourcing of part of the previously subcontracted specialized testing in-house.

(l) The presentation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) is for informational
purposes only. The calculations for Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) are based
on various assumptions and management estimates. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the
acquisitions for which an adjustment is made occurred and been fully integrated on January 1, 2020. The EBITDA of each of the relevant
acquired companies for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 may not be representative of what the EBITDA of such entities would have
been for the period, as the case may be, had the acquisitions for which an adjustment is made occurred and been fully integrated on January
1, 2021. In addition, the estimated cost savings and synergies reflected in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
(excluding COVID-19 impact) are based on various assumptions and management estimates and are presented on an annual run-rate basis as
if such cost savings and synergies had been fully realized at the beginning of the relevant period. We may not be able to achieve these cost
savings and synergies in a timely manner or at all. The estimated cost savings and synergies are based on a number of assumptions made in
reliance on the information available to us and management's judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating
synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our estimates of cost savings and synergies. These numbers have
not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the relevant acquired
companies for periods prior to their acquisition, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial
information included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) are included in this offering memorandum because we believe
that they provide a useful measure of our results of operations; however, this information does not constitute a measure of financial
performance under French GAAP, and you should not consider Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding
COVID-19 impact) as alternatives to operating income/(loss) or any other performance measure derived in accordance with French GAAP or
as a measure of our results of operations or liquidity. Other companies, including those in our industry, may calculate a similarly titled financial
measure differently from us, and so the presentation of such financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of
other companies. Funds depicted by certain of these measures may not be available for management's discretionary use due to covenant
restrictions, debt service payments or other commitments.

(m) Represents the restatement of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our EBITDA, including the exclusion of additional EBITDA
generated by COVID-19-related testing activity, which we consider to be non-recurring. The COVID-19 impact related to the 2021
Acquisitions was €33 million.

(n) Represents the EBITDA generated by COVID-19-related testing activity that we deem recurring as is permitted when calculating
“Consolidated EBITDA” as defined under the Indenture.

(8) Adjusted EBITDA margin, expressed as a percentage, is calculated as (i) Adjusted EBITDA, divided by (ii) total net sales.

(9) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin, expressed as a percentage, is calculated as (i) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, divided by (ii) total pro
forma net sales of €2,515.5 million.

(10) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) margin, expressed as a percentage, is calculated as (i) Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact), divided by (ii) total pro forma net sales (excluding COVID-19 impact) of €1,330.9 million.

(11) As adjusted interest expense represents our estimated interest expense on a pro forma basis for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, after
giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on June 30, 2021. This reflects the interest expense in connection with debt incurred
under our existing financial leases and other financial debt that is expected to remain outstanding on the Additional Notes Issue Date and the
Additional Notes offered hereby. See “Use of Proceeds”.

As adjusted interest expense has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our interest expense
would have actually been had the Transactions occurred on June 30, 2021, nor does it purport to project our interest expense for any future
period or our financial position at any future date.

(12) As adjusted net financial debt represents the principal amount of our loans and borrowings including the principal amount of the Additional
Notes offered hereby after giving effect to the Transactions and the application of the proceeds therefrom as if the Transactions occurred on
June 30, 2021 and assumes the Additional Notes are issued at par. See “Use of Proceeds”.

(13) As adjusted net senior secured financial debt represents the principal amount of our loans and borrowings including the principal amount of
the Additional Notes offered hereby after giving effect to the Transactions and the application of the proceeds therefrom as if the Transactions
occurred on June 30, 2021 and assumes the Additional Notes are issued at par.

_This offering memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual_
_results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors,_
_including the risks described below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Industry**

**_The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has caused severe disruptions in the global economy and financial_**
**_markets which could adversely affect our business._**

In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was first detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World
Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and governmental authorities around the world implemented
measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The global spread of COVID-19 and the various attempts to contain it created
and continue to cause significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The extent to which the COVID-19 may
continue to impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain. In an effort to halt
the outbreak of COVID-19, countries throughout the world, including the countries in which we operate, placed significant
restrictions such as shelter in place or stay-at-home orders and many businesses announced extended closures in 2020.
Such jurisdictions may renew quarantines or introduce other measures in response to a resurgence of COVID-19 or other
viruses, which could significantly impact our ability to support our operations and customers.

While our key collection sites and technical platforms have remained open and operational, and the increase in demand for
COVID-19-related PCR and serology testing has offset the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (which were
estimated to be approximately €41 million on net sales since March 2020) on our business and results of operations, we
experienced:

      - a significant decrease in volumes of non-critical medical testing during the initial lockdown in France and Belgium
in 2020,

      - an increase in absenteeism of employees in patient-facing activities during the initial lockdown in France between
March and May 2020,

      - the need for recruitment of nurses and non-biologists on temporary contracts to meet the French population’s
needs for COVID-19 tests,

      - an increase in our orders of reagents, and

      - an increase in capital expenditures related to dedicated COVID-19 diagnostics equipment and other supplies such
as gloves, swabs and masks.


-----

Furthermore, although the high demand for COVID-19 diagnostic services had a net positive effect on our financial
condition and represents a significant part of our net sales in 2020 and the six months ended 30 June, 2021, we cannot
guarantee that such demand will continue in the medium- to long-term. Beginning in late 2020, countries began to approve
the widespread use of COVID-19 vaccines. As of October 31, 2021, approximately 76% and 75% of the population in
France and Belgium, respectively, had received a full course of vaccination treatment (not including boosters). As COVID-
19 vaccines become more effective and widely used over the next one-to-two years, it is possible that the COVID-19
diagnostic services market may see a significant decrease. Any such decrease could significantly reduce our revenue with
respect to COVID-19-related testing.

Our business continuity could be adversely affected in the event that our employees are affected in significant numbers by
a resurgence of the pandemic. Volatility in capital markets that could be exacerbated by a resurgence of the pandemic could
adversely impact our future ability to access debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, due to the disruption and
instability in the global financial markets or deterioration in credit and financing conditions, which could affect our ability
to meet liquidity requirements.

The duration and ongoing impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately
predicted at this time, such as mutations and new strains of the virus, which may have higher transmission rates or be
partially or completely resistant to current or future vaccinations, and the extent and effectiveness of containment actions.
The disruptions caused by the pandemic, including any renewed or sustained lockdowns mandated by the government,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
While the French and Belgian governments have reimbursed the testing services provider the costs of PCR tests in full in
the past, their reimbursement policies have since been updated to decrease the reimbursement price levels in France and to
require certain conditions to be met to qualify for full reimbursement, and their reimbursement policies may further change
from time to time. For example, as of December 15, 2020, PCR testing services providers in France were reimbursed by
the government at €73.59 in total per test) if the test results are provided within 12 hours from testing. As of October 15,
2021 PCR tests in France are reimbursed for vaccinated people or people with prescriptions at €43.89 per test (reference
price when performed by a medical biology laboratory and at €50.64 per test if results are provided within 12 hours.
Moreover, as of October 15, 2021, the French government decided to stop reimbursing PCR testing and so-called “comfort”
antigen tests for anyone who was unvaccinated subject to certain limited exceptions. The price for antigenic tests is fixed
at €22 per test (when performed by a medical biology laboratory). In Belgium, if conditions for reimbursement by the
government (including a prescription) are met, the price per PCR test that the lab receives varies between €44.04 and
€47.18 per test (depending on the reasons to perform the test). Between June and September, there was a temporary extra
fee of €10 for the collection by medical staff, but that ended on 30 September 2021. Any further changes in the policies or
related developments that may reduce the demand or volume of COVID-19-related tests could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Furthermore, the budget deficit
caused by COVID-19 spending could place extra pressure on medical lab testing related budget in France and Belgium or
any other markets in which we may operate in the future, which could place further pressure on testing prices and reduce
the level of reimbursement by the government entities. This may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash
flows and prospects. See “Summary—Other Recent Developments—Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.” Because the
COVID-19 situation is unprecedented and continuously evolving, the other potential impacts to our risk factors that are
further described below are uncertain.

**_We operate in a highly regulated sector. Compliance with regulations applicable to our activities may increase our costs_**
**_or restrict our activities. Failure to comply with such regulations may lead to penalties of various types. Future_**
**_alterations to regulations applicable to us may have a material adverse impact on our activities._**

The medical diagnostics industry (including medical laboratory testing) is subject to extensive regulations and controls by
various regulatory authorities in France, Belgium and any of the other countries in which we operate. These regulations
and controls have a significant influence on the way we carry out our activities. For medical laboratories, these regulations
mainly pertain to professional qualifications of laboratory personnel, ownership and corporate governance constraints on
companies that operate laboratories (which are especially strict in France) and the pricing and reimbursement levels for
medical tests. Our activities are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations, particularly with respect to the
handling and storage of certain chemicals and reagents, the disposal of biological waste (waste from care activities that


-----

carry a risk of infection), the handling and storage of personal data (including patients’ medical records and test results),
relationships with doctors and hospitals (including laws and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and regulating gifts and
fringe benefits) and the prevention of fraud on social security systems. Our compliance with such regulations is monitored
by the relevant administrative authorities in the countries and regions in which we operate, as well as by the competent
professional associations.

Compliance with current or future laws and regulations may cause an increase in our administrative, legal and operational
expenditure, force us to alter our commercial practices, our legal organization, the ownership structure and corporate
governance of our subsidiaries or, more generally, reduce or limit our net sales. Such laws and regulations have a broad
scope of application and their interpretation by the competent administrative authorities or professional associations is
subject to change. Potential efforts to comply with existing laws and regulations, new interpretations of such laws and
regulations or new laws and regulations may generate substantial additional costs for us. Failure to comply with such
regulations may also lead to sanctions of various kinds for us and potentially for medical biologists working for us.
Sanctions may be administrative (fines, periodic penalty payments, temporary or permanent closures of laboratories),
disciplinary (temporary or permanent removal of the right to practice), civil (damages) or criminal (a ban on operating a
medical laboratory or imprisonment).

In addition, changes affecting certain regulations or government programs that are not directly connected with the medical
diagnostics sector, and in particular regulations relating to prescription control, co-payment, doctors, health insurers and
hospitals, may also affect us and impair our results of operations and our ability to expand our activities.

In general, if we fail to comply with applicable regulations, if they change or are interpreted in a manner adverse to us or
if we cannot maintain, renew or secure required permits, licenses, accreditations, agreements or other necessary
administrative authorizations, we may be unable to pursue our activities or market our services, be excluded from
participating in public healthcare programs, no longer be able to enter into contracts with third-party payers, suffer penalties
or civil and criminal fines, or be subject to complaints by third parties, with the financial consequences that may result
under any of the foregoing scenarios. Although we could develop a strategy to anticipate such regulatory changes, our
industry and operating environment may not respond to those changes in the way we expect, and we may, as a result, be
unable to maintain our position in those markets or apply our strategy in such markets. In addition, our competitors may,
in the future, gain greater financial resources or stronger market positions than ours and may be able to better respond to
future regulatory reforms. If we cannot respond effectively to regulatory and market changes, our outlook and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

These laws and regulations, the extent of some of which have not been fully interpreted by courts, may require us to modify
our operations or impose additional compliance expenses or burdens or give rise to administrative fines and penalties. For
example, recent French regulatory reforms have imposed stricter International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”)
operating standards (namely ISO 15189, with which our laboratories and facilities in France were 100% accredited as of
October 31, 2021), and introduced minimum accreditation standards for laboratories, which can be costly and time
consuming.

As of November 1, 2021, a medical laboratory may no longer perform medical biology examinations corresponding to the
scope lines (lignes de portée) for which it is not accredited without having submitted to COFRAC an application for
accreditation relating to such scope lines.

The decree dated July 16, 2020 (arrêté définissant le cadre de l’accréditation mentionnée à l’article L. 6221-1 du code de
_la santé publique) and the decree dated March 8, 2021 (arrêté fixant les examens représentatifs et les compétences associées_
_pour l’accréditation des lignes de portée des examens de biologie médicale) provide additional details on the content of_
scope line accreditation: the scope line is considered as accredited when one or more representative examinations for the
scope line in question, combining common professional competencies (metrology, staff authorizations, etc.), are accredited
by COFRAC.

The laboratory accreditation process involves the preparation of written applications, site studies and assessment of the
scope of changes required to comply with new standards, the appointment of external qualified experts, the training of our


-----

staff, the participation of our staff in the process in addition to their usual workload, the payment of certain administrative
fees and the implementation of new quality software.

Accreditation may be delayed based on many factors, including the number of sites operated by a medical laboratory and
the responsiveness of the accreditation body, COFRAC (Comité français d’accréditation), which has been negatively
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have already undertaken to conduct our business in compliance with
these heightened standards, any further changes in laws and regulations may require us to further modify our operations.
In Belgium, accreditation under the ISO 15189 standard has become a condition for the reimbursement of laboratory tests
performed on the DNA of microorganisms (such as viruses) pursuant to the Royal Decree of March 19, 2008, modifying
the annex of the Royal Decree of September 14, 1984, establishing the list of healthcare services eligible for reimbursement
by public health insurance. According to the Royal Decree of January 31, 2006, BELAC (Organisme belge
_d’Accréditation) is the only public body authorized to give such accreditation. However, accreditation under BELAC does_
not otherwise affect reimbursement and is not necessary for the majority of medical tests. As of October 31, 2021,
Biogroup’s laboratories and facilities in France were 100% accredited by COFRAC under the ISO 15189 standard. All but
one of our collection sites in Belgium have obtained the BELAC accreditation in line with the ISO 15189 standard.

As discussed below, French law imposes stringent restrictions on the legal structure and ownership of medical laboratories.
See “Risks Related to Our Business—We may not exercise full control over the operations of our French subsidiaries in
_which we have a minority voting interest, including the Issuer, and are dependent on the biologists who own a majority_
_voting interest in them to conduct the operations of such subsidiaries.”_

Moreover, all arrangements between shareholders of our laboratory companies that are not contained in the bylaws could
become unenforceable if they are not communicated to the relevant professional association. Article L. 6223-8 III of the
French Public Health Code provides that, in order to be enforceable, all arrangements relating to a laboratory company
(including shareholder agreements) must be communicated to the relevant professional association (Ordre national des
_pharmaciens and/or Ordre national des médecins). Failing to do so, the shareholding agreements pertaining to our_
laboratory companies could become unenforceable.

In addition, we are subject to specific Belgian regulations relating to the operation of the medical laboratory business. In
particular, the Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 (implementing Article 3 §1(2) of the Royal Decree n° 143 of December 30,
1982) lists the four legal forms that medical laboratory companies may take in order to be eligible for reimbursement by
the Belgian public health insurance system. The duration of this Royal Decree, which was initially due to expire on
December 31, 2009, has been extended retroactively until December 31, 2012, by a Royal Decree of January 27, 2010. The
regulatory authorities have confirmed that to date, no new Royal Decree has been adopted. As the term of the Royal Decree
of April 26, 2007 has expired, and to date no new royal decree has been adopted, there is currently no legal framework
regulating the legal forms that medical laboratory companies should take in order to be eligible for reimbursement by the
Belgian public health insurance system. See “Regulation—Belgium.” It is currently unclear whether a new Decree will be
adopted and, if so, what its content will be. The absence of any form of extension of the duration of the Royal Decree of
April 26, 2007 could have a significant impact on all Belgian laboratories run under the same corporate form as ours,
including us.

In the event of our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, our reputation could be damaged and important
relationships with government regulators or third parties could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_The prices we may charge in our markets are dependent on prices set by governments. Efforts to reduce government_**
**_spending on healthcare and diagnostic testing may adversely affect our business._**

In France and Belgium, most of our activities are highly regulated. In particular, there are mandatory prices or pricing
methodologies for a large majority of the medical tests we perform. Prices are established by governments and we have
limited, or no, influence over the levels at which they are set. Revisions of prices may occur on a regular basis. Overall
price decreases, or the implementation of a pricing formula that fails to keep up with testing costs, may reduce our margins


-----

and may affect our net sales from testing services, our operating results or the economic feasibility of providing certain
testing services by some or all of our collection sites and technical platforms.

We are particularly sensitive to prices in France, as the majority of our business is located in France, which represented
90% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. In the French private medical laboratory test
market, tests are state-regulated and prices and reimbursement tariffs are set by the Ministry of Health and the national
healthcare regulatory body, CNAM, and are revised at least on an annual basis. Most recently, the CNAM entered into the
Current Triennial Plan in March 2020, under which the annual budget growth for medical lab tests is set for three years,
and allows an increase of up to 0.40% in 2020, 0.50% in 2021 and 0.60% in 2022, excluding COVID-19 related tests.
Based on the size of the private lab market in the industry report and the proportion of spending in the French private
medical testing market according to “Les dépenses de santé en 2020 —Résultats des comptes de la santé,” a report
published in 2021 by Panorama de La Drees Santé, approximately 79.1% (or €4.9 billion) of spending in the French private
medical testing market was financed by the French social security system and the remainder was covered by private
insurance companies (approximately 17.2%, or €1.07 billion) and by the patient directly out-of-pocket (approximately
2.2%, or €0.138 billion) in 2020. See “Industry—Medical Laboratory Testing”, “Industry—France” and “Regulation—
_France” for more information. Although the percentage of spending financed by the social security system has remained_
relatively constant over time, the regulatory prices in the French lab market have declined by approximately 1.5% during
the period from 2014 to 2019, according to the industry report. We cannot be certain of the extent of any future stagnation
or reductions in prices that do not keep up with the respective testing costs. Based on _Les dépenses de santé en 2019 —_
_Résultats des comptes de la santé by Panorama de La Drees Santé, the French government has targeted annual savings in_
French healthcare expenditures of approximately €1 billion in 2021. Both public and private medical testing expenditures
represented approximately 5.5% of overall French healthcare expenditures in 2019. While this reimbursement structure
had been stable for years, the 100% reimbursement of COVID testing by the French social security system as from late
July 2020 has led to an increase of its share in the financing of MLT spending with the French social security system
covering approximately 79.1% of spending in 2020, according to “Les dépenses de santé en 2020 —Résultats des comptes
_de la santé”. Given the very high COVID testing activity since the beginning of the year, we expect this trend to be similar_
in 2021.

See “Industry—Medical Laboratory Testing”, “Industry—France” and “Regulation—France” for more information.

Since our acquisition of Medina Group, a Belgian laboratory testing company conducting routine laboratory testing in
Belgium, in October 2020, we are now also exposed to pricing decisions by regulators in Belgium. In the Belgian private
medical laboratory test market, tests are also state-regulated and in practice prices and reimbursement tariffs are set by the
Belgian government and national healthcare regulatory body, RIZIV/INAMI, and are revised at least on an annual basis.
According to the RIZIV/INAMI, the Belgian social security system reimburses between 70% and 100% of regulated
medical test expenditures, while the patient contribution ranges from 0% to 30%. Currently, the Belgian pricing system
includes a “claw back” mechanism that allows the Belgian government to recover budgetary overspend. See “Regulation—
_Belgium.” According to the industry report, historical prices of routine tests in the private medical laboratory testing market_
in Belgium have increased by approximately 1% per annum since 2010, with national social welfare agency contributions
roughly tracking inflation and patient contribution levels remaining stable. There can be no guarantee that prices will
continue in line with this trend, particularly given that the Belgian national social welfare agency intends to change its
medical reimbursement scheme, which could include a price reduction affecting the medical laboratory testing market, due
to a high and increasing social security deficit.

Due to the high levels of government spending required to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a possibility that
government health insurance schemes may be curtailed or otherwise restricted due to budgetary pressures in the long term.
Although the French and Belgian governments have provided, and are expected to provide in the future, additional budgets
for healthcare costs related to external shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, there cannot be any assurance that such
additional budgets will continue to be made available on the same terms or at all. As a general matter, future reductions in
government health insurance coverage, including in the wake of high levels of spending in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic, could put downward pressure on regulatory pricing for medical tests, thus adversely affecting our results of
operations and financial condition. Furthermore, because of the importance of the French market to our business, we are
specifically exposed to budgetary pressures in France and further price reductions in France could significantly adversely


-----

affect our overall performance. For more detail on French prices for laboratory tests, see ““Industry—Medical Laboratory
_Testing,” and “Industry—France.”_

We expect increased constraints on government regulated prices to continue in both France and Belgium. Both France and
Belgium have in the past, and may in the future, pursue expenditure control measures aimed at curbing spending, including
healthcare expenditures. In particular, governments tend to reduce price levels in greater proportion on tests that are
administered in high volumes, which has a multiplying effect on our results as the tests we perform in high volumes tend
to be impacted by larger price cuts. As of October 15, 2021 PCR tests in France are notably reimbursed for vaccinated
people or people with prescriptions at €43.89 per test and at €50.64 per test if results are provided within 12 hours.
Moreover, as of October 15, 2021, the French government decided to stop reimbursing PCR testing and so-called “comfort”
antigen tests for anyone who was unvaccinated subject to certain limited exceptions. In addition, any changes in
government or in the political environment in the countries in which we operate may cause future regulatory changes in
the healthcare industry, which could have a negative impact on our business. For example, policies that constrain
consolidation in markets in which we operate, limit or decrease the amounts we may charge for our services or exclude
coverage of certain of our services from public health programs may have a material adverse effect on our net sales and
operating results.

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_We may not exercise full control over the operations of our French subsidiaries in which we have a minority voting_**
**_interest, including the Issuer, and are dependent on the biologists who own a majority voting interest in them to conduct_**
**_the operations of such subsidiaries._**

French law sets regulatory constraints on the corporate structure and nature of ownership of the share capital of medical
laboratories. In particular, French law limits (i) persons who are not medical biologists and entities that are not laboratory
companies from holding more than 25% of a laboratory company’s share capital and (ii) external medical biologists and
entities that are laboratory companies from holding more than 49.99% of the voting rights and, subject to certain exceptions,
of the share capital in a laboratory company. French law also requires that medical laboratories must take the corporate
form of a SEL or SELAS (unless they are organized as a non-profit organization, or a _société civile professionnelle_
(“SCP”), or a cooperative undertaking). See “Regulation—France.”

Presently, we primarily conduct our business through our subsidiaries in France and Belgium, which we own and operate
through CAB, which is incorporated as a SELAS under French law. Our founder, Stéphane Eimer, a medical biologist,
directly and indirectly holds a majority of the voting rights of Laboratoire Eimer, the remainder being held by medical
biologists and other minority shareholders. Laboratoire Eimer owns 99.99% of the share capital, 49.99% of the voting
rights and 99.97% of the financial rights in CAB, with the remainder being held by in-house medical biologists and other
minority shareholders.

Due to the limitation under French law described above, CAB, which holds our French and Belgian laboratory subsidiaries,
holds between approximately 40% to 49.99% of the voting rights in our French laboratory subsidiaries, with biologists
operating such French laboratory subsidiaries holding the majority of the voting rights. The bylaws of such French
laboratory subsidiaries allow CAB to hold approximately between 50% and 99% of the financial rights (e.g. rights to
receive dividend payments) in its French laboratory subsidiaries. See “Business—Our Corporate Structure (SEL/SELAS)”
for more information on our structure.

Certain of the shareholders of our French laboratory subsidiaries have entered into shareholders’ agreements or similar
agreements with the biologists working in the relevant French laboratory subsidiary. Certain of these agreements allow the
representatives of the shareholders to hold positions at the managing bodies of such French laboratory subsidiary, but such
managing bodies do not have control over any managerial decisions at the laboratory subsidiary and consultative in nature.

In addition, the obligations and constraints resulting from such agreements are limited by French regulatory constraints
regarding the independence of biologists. The legal representatives of a French laboratory subsidiary company must be
medical biologists working within such laboratory company, and are appointed by decision of the shareholders of the
laboratory company, the majority of which are medical biologists. As a result, we are dependent on the biologists who hold


-----

the majority of the voting rights in our French subsidiaries for decisions affecting these subsidiaries’ day to day routine
operations. Although we exercise de facto control over our French laboratory subsidiaries through CAB, the biologists who
hold the majority of the voting rights in our French laboratory subsidiaries may not necessarily share our views on the
manner in which the subsidiaries should be managed and may exercise their voting rights in a manner adverse to us. This
could disrupt the operations of our French laboratories and divert our management’s time and attention from the operation
of our business. If our business activities were disrupted due to a conflict with our biologists, our operating results could
be negatively affected.

In addition, under the terms of the articles of associations, bylaws and shareholders’ agreements of certain of our French
laboratory subsidiaries, as the case may be, we may be required to purchase shares held by the medical biologist
shareholders upon their retirement or for other reasons. We are permitted to, as shareholders of our laboratory subsidiaries,
substitute a medical biologist shareholder for another medical biologist shareholder under the relevant articles of
associations, bylaws and shareholders’ agreements, as the case may be. If the leaving medical biologists are not replaced
in a timely manner, it may result in our holding a greater percentage of the share capital and voting rights in such French
laboratory subsidiaries than is permitted by French law. Although there is a one-year grace period (and, if an interested
person brings a legal action against the relevant laboratory company, an additional six-months grace period to remedy the
situation may be granted) in the law to reduce holdings back down to the maximum permitted level, if we fail to reduce
our holdings within such period in compliance with the relevant French law, we may be required to dissolve or wind up
such subsidiary. Furthermore, the grace period does not technically apply to the validity of the licenses of such subsidiaries
and, as such, if we surpass the maximum ownership threshold for share capital and voting rights, even during the one-year
grace period, the licenses of such subsidiaries could be subject to revocation, although our licenses have never been subject
to such revocation under these conditions.

Although we typically seek to align the shareholders’ agreements of our newly acquired French laboratory subsidiaries
with those of our existing subsidiaries, because the consent of the biologists is required for such alignment, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.

However, Laboratoire Eimer remains a holding company in charge of defining the strategy of the Group (“holding
_animatrice”)._

Moreover, our institutional investors hold bonds convertible or redeemable into preferred shares of Holdco. Upon
conversion or redemption of such bonds in part or in whole, our current shareholders’ shareholding in Holdco, and therefore
in Laboratoire Eimer, may be significantly diluted. See “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure” for more
information.

We are subject to ongoing legal proceedings, the result of which may require us to amend the existing ownership and legal
structure of our French operations and to implement a new structure for any future acquisitions. In March 2017, certain
trade unions brought a lawsuit, which did not involve Biogroup, against, Cerba Selafa, Cefid and Cerba Healthcare (the
“Cerba Group”) initiated legal proceedings against, among others, Laborizon, CAB and Laborizon Centre (the “Cerba
**Litigation”) against the Cerba Group seeking a judgment that would nullify or render inoperable certain provisions in the**
articles of incorporation and shareholder agreements in certain of the Cerba Group’s subsidiaries that are subject to French
legal restrictions on the legal structure and ownership of medical laboratories (the “March 2017 Litigation”). On
December 14, 2020, the Cerba Group initiated legal proceedings seeking that any judgment in the March 2017 Litigation
(if rendered in favor of such trade unions) be imposed on, among others, Laborizon, CAB and Laborizon Centre as well
(the “Cerba Litigation”). The procedural incident was pleaded before the Court on May 18, 2021. By deliberation
delivered on September 2, 2021, the Court rejected all of Cerba’s claims against Biogroup companies. Cerba Group
appealed against this decision.

While the legal and practical consequences of such judgments against Biogroup, our subsidiaries and the medical laboratory
industry in which we operate are currently unclear, we may be required to amend the existing ownership and legal structure
of our French operations and may not be able to continue using our existing acquisition strategy for future acquisitions in
France. This may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our
growth through acquisitions could be significantly limited. See “Business—Legal Proceedings” and “Regulation—France”
for more information.


-----

**_We face risks associated with the acquisition of businesses in connection with our strategy._**

In the past we have made strategic acquisitions by acquiring laboratory testing groups in France and Belgium, such as
Unilians Biogroup (formerly known as Dyomedea-Neolab), Bioesterel, Medina, Unilians (which has been merged into
Dyomedea-Neolab on June 1, 2021 which was renamed Unilians Biogroup), and Laborizon, and continue to look for
opportunities for future acquisitions. We have also made acquisitions in our new regions of Spain and Luxembourg,
including Cerba Internacional and 80% of a holding company with a 50% interest in Analiza in Spain, and LLR
Luxembourg in Luxembourg. Our growth strategy is to focus on smaller acquisitions of laboratories with one or more
testing platforms, upgrade them to equip them with the latest technology and increase their testing capacity, and utilize
them as a regional centralized testing platform for the additional collection sites that we acquire subsequently in the same
geographic region, which generates significant cost savings and optimization. We may also consider larger acquisitions in
regions and segments of the market in which we are already present in order to increase our market share, or in other new
regions and segments of the market in order to establish a foothold. For instance, in the years ended December 31, 2018,
2019 and 2020, we completed eleven, sixteen and six acquisitions, respectively. As of October 31, 2021, we have completed
twelve acquisitions during 2021. In the regions in which we are already present and our new regions of Luxembourg and
Spain, we plan to focus primarily on small- and mid-sized bolt-on acquisitions going forward. Acquisitions in new regions
are likely to focus on mid-sized to larger targets that we believe will provide us with sufficient scale and both local
collection sites and technical platforms. Any such acquisition could substantially increase the amount of our outstanding
debt.

The success of our acquisition strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, conduct
appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately agree and complete such transactions
and successfully integrate the acquired business into our Group. Our plans to acquire additional businesses in the future
are subject to the availability of suitable opportunities at an attractive price and planned acquisitions may not materialize.
The continued consolidation of the French medical laboratory testing market, as well as the restrictions on both regional
market share and outsourcing, may limit the opportunities for acquisitions. Current laboratory ownership constraints in
France have allowed for the development of regional laboratory hubs that combine several smaller local laboratories into
a larger regional entity. However, French regulation still limits the proportion of tests that one person or entity may perform
in a specified territory or in a relevant market, which limits our ability to pursue this strategy and may require us to
undertake to divest certain businesses or sites in order to comply with decisions of competent anti-trust regulators.

For example, in connection with the Laborizon Acquisition, CAB sold Sèvre Biologie to Synlab in February 2021 to
comply with a decision of the French Competition Authority.

Additionally, as part of the acquisition of Oriade-Noviale, we will sell on November 30, 2021 eight branch offices (sites)
to Eurofins to comply with a decision of the French Competition Authority.

Further, French tax reforms may limit biologists’ willingness to sell to a potential buyer by imposing prohibitive capital
gains tax rates. Furthermore, acquisitions of businesses with a turnover of at least €40 million (consolidated at the target
group or subgroup level) in Belgium may be subject to review by the Belgian competition authority. Some of our
competitors are following similar acquisition strategies and they, and certain financial investors interested in entering our
market, may have greater financial resources available for investments or may have capacity to accept less favorable terms
than we can accept, preventing us from acquiring the businesses that we target and/or reducing the number of potential
acquisition targets. In addition, certain of our competitors already have, or may attain through acquisitions, a greater
geographical footprint within a particular region or country making them a more attractive acquirer for potential targets
seeking to join a network, the size of which they believe will provide greater business prospects.

We expand into new regions by targeting dynamic geographical areas or areas where we already enjoy a dense network,
thus allowing for a high level of synergies. Our acquisition strategy focuses on first acquiring a significant position in a
new territory and implementing synergies, then performing bolt-on acquisitions to densify, expand and optimize lab
networks. Generally, we acquire businesses based on a business plan which depends, in part, on anticipated synergies that
will materialize after the combination of the acquired business with our own. The success of our acquisition strategy hinges
upon the successful implementation of our business plans and realization of such synergies or cost savings within a
reasonable timeframe. Achieving synergies can be difficult and uncertain. Implementing a business plan, including


-----

achieving net sales targets in strategic international acquisitions, may not succeed on the targeted timeline or at all. We
anticipate the targeted synergies based on our due diligence of the target company (including its existing governance
structure) as well as standalone business models. Changes in either affect the timeframe in which we are able to realize
such synergies or our ability to realize them at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the customer
base or other contractual arrangement with third parties of businesses we acquire (in particular where they are subject to
change of control clauses), generate expected margins or cash flows, or realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions,
including growth or expected synergies, in the timeframe and at the costs we initially anticipate, if at all. Although we
analyze acquisition targets, those assessments are subject to assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates,
company valuations and ability to redeploy the workforce. There can be no assurance that our assessments of and
assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may significantly differ from
our expectations. In most cases, acquisitions involve the integration of a separate business that was previously operated
independently with different systems and processes.

Even if we are able to acquire new companies, unless we are able to integrate the companies we acquire in the future into
our own operations successfully, our ability to expand our operations and operate efficiently may weaken. We may not be
able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our business or such integration may require more investment or time than
we expect, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies with respect to customers,
employees, government authorities or public health programs, private health insurers, or to other parties, which may impact
our results of operations. Certain of the businesses we acquire may not have robust accounting systems, internal controls
and reporting systems, and as such the historical financial results of such businesses may be different from those reported
to us. Additionally, from time to time, disputes may arise with the sellers of businesses we acquire, some of whom may
continue to hold interests in the company or occupy management positions. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” Such
risks can be exacerbated in executing international acquisitions, as we may be less familiar with the competitive, operational
and regulatory environments in these markets and may not be able to identify suitable targets or be able to integrate them
successfully to achieve the desired synergies. The process of integrating businesses may be disruptive to our operations
and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such businesses or a decrease in our results of operations as a
result of difficulties or risks, including:

      - unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual and other issues;

      - loss of key customers or employees;

      - delays in redeploying our workforce;

      - difficulty in standardizing information and other systems;

      - difficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure;

      - difficulty in realizing operating synergies;

      - failure to maintain the quality or timeliness of services that we have historically provided;

      - added costs of dealing with such disruptions;

      - regulatory and labor law restrictions on the redeployment or termination of employees;

      - unforeseen challenges from operating in new geographic areas; and

      - diversion of management’s attention from our day to day business as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing
disruptions and difficulties.

Furthermore, we may operate and acquire businesses in different countries, with different regulatory and operating cultures,
which may exacerbate the risks described above. If we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy or integrate
acquired businesses successfully, our business and our growth could be negatively affected.


-----

For more details on the particular regulations that directly affect our business, see “Regulation.”

**_Failure to establish and comply with appropriate quality standards in the provision of our testing services could result_**
**_in litigation and liabilities and adversely impact our reputation._**

The tests we perform as part of our business are intended to supply healthcare professionals with information to help them
establish or support diagnoses and prescribe medication and treatment for patient care. Inaccuracies or negligence in
performing our testing services could lead to inaccurate drug efficacy and safety studies, incorrect diagnoses by doctors,
prescriptions of inappropriate treatment or decisions not to prescribe treatment when treatment is required, which may lead
to illness, harm, death, other adverse effects or liabilities. Errors such as misidentifying or inaccurately labeling samples,
compromising the integrity of samples and errors caused by testing machines or reagents may occur. Claims and litigation
against us may result in liability for the harm or other adverse effects caused. Payments related to such liabilities may
adversely affect our liquidity and financial position to the extent our existing insurance does not cover such liabilities and
may adversely affect our reputation. The process of defending such cases, even when we are successful in our defense, is
costly, could distract management from executing our strategy and could result in substantial damage to our reputation in
the medical community and with patients. To the extent we are held liable for misrepresentation or negligence, the damages
that we may owe could have a material negative financial impact on our business. Our competitors are also subject to
inaccuracies and negligence in their businesses, which may lead to illness, harm, death and other liabilities. To the extent
any such negligence results in litigation or an adverse outcome, we cannot guarantee that we will not be affected by any
resulting reputational harm to our competitors and to our industry more generally. Any such reputational harm could have
a material negative impact on our business and results of operations.

**_Continued weakness in economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses._**

Economic downturns may increase the risk associated with conducting our business. Economic difficulties tend to result
in reduced levels of activity and have led governments, private insurers and patients to reduce their expenditures on
healthcare, which has affected our net sales and margins.

Where patients, directly or indirectly (such as through private health insurance premiums), are responsible for all or part
of the cost of laboratory tests, individual decisions to reduce healthcare expenditures may result in a reduction of demand
for our services. Based on the size of the private lab market in the industry report and the proportion of spending in the
French private medical testing market according to “Les dépenses de santé en 2020 —Résultats des comptes de la santé,”
a report published in 2021 by Panorama de La Drees Santé, approximately 79.1% (or €4.9 billion) of spending in the French
private medical testing market was financed by the French social security system and the remainder was covered by private
insurance companies (approximately 17.2%, or €1.07 billion) and by the patient directly out-of-pocket (approximately
2.2%, or €0.138 billion) in 2020. In Belgium, a patient’s out-of-pocket patient expenses amount up to 30% of the total
price of medical tests, on average, and generally act as a deterrent against overspending on medical testing. A decrease in
household disposable income, or the perception thereof, in times of economic downturn can lead to a reduction in
individuals’ healthcare expenditure. This may result in patients postponing certain types of medical treatment and could
result in a drop in the volume of business we are able to conduct through our operations.

Governments, as direct payers of a test’s price, whether in part or in whole, have also instituted policies designed to reduce
their expenditures on healthcare as a means of reducing overall budget deficits. As a result of such policies, changes in
medical guidelines could occur, leading to lower volumes of recurring tests. Such changes could have a negative impact
on our business.

As of October 15, 2021, the French government decided to stop reimbursing PCR testing and so-called “comfort” antigen
tests for anyone who was unvaccinated subject to certain limited exceptions.

Future economic downturns may lead governments, public health authorities, private insurers and patients to further reduce
their expenditures on healthcare. Where patients are directly or indirectly responsible for all or part of the cost of laboratory
tests, individual decisions to reduce healthcare expenditures may result in a reduction in demand for our services. A
decrease in household disposable income, or the perception thereof, in times of economic downturn can lead to a reduction
in individuals’ healthcare expenditures. This may result in patients postponing certain types of medical treatment and could


-----

result in a significant decrease in our volume of tests and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our pro forma financial information may not be representative of our results as a Group; additionally, our actual_**
**_financial condition and results of operations may differ materially._**

The pro forma information and metrics, including pro forma net sales, included in this offering memorandum are presented
for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what our actual financial condition or results of operations
would have been had the relevant acquisitions been completed on the dates indicated. The pro forma information reflects
adjustments to illustrate the effect of acquisitions had they been completed on the date indicated, which are based upon
preliminary estimates, to record the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting
goodwill recognized. The Issuer accounts for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting under French GAAP
and applies purchase accounting adjustments in connection with such acquisitions. In addition, the assumptions used in
preparing the pro forma information may not prove to be accurate.

**_We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value thereof._**

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill. Total goodwill which represents the excess of cost over the fair value
of the net assets of the businesses acquired, was €3,288.9 million as of June 30, 2021, or 74.7% of our total assets (including
goodwill). We expect goodwill to increase further as a result of the purchase accounting for the 2021 Acquisitions, with
exact amounts determined following the respective purchase price allocations.

Goodwill is recorded on the date of an acquisition and is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is any
indication of impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance, a decline in
expected future cash flows, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations (including
changes that restrict the activities of, or affect the services provided by, our collection sites and technical platforms) and a
variety of other factors. The amount of any impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to our income statement.
Any future impairment of goodwill may result in material reductions of our income and equity.

**_If we lose the service of members of our senior management team, our business and operating results may be harmed._**

The execution of our strategy and our continued success depend in part on the skills, continued efforts and motivation of
our senior management team and other key personnel. Our strategy for organic growth and improved operating efficiency
depends on our senior management having deep knowledge of our business operations. Our external growth strategy
requires knowledge of the dynamics and relevant players in the various markets in which we operate. Loss of the services
of key members of our senior management or experienced personnel could disrupt the pursuit of our strategy. If one or
more members of our senior management team or key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present
positions, including for health, family or other personal reasons, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all. An
inability to attract and retain qualified members or key personnel in a timely manner could have a material and adverse
effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, if Stéphane Eimer, who is our
Group Chief Executive Officer and founder, and also a majority shareholder of Laboratoire Eimer, no longer owns the
majority of the share capital of Laboratoire Eimer, there could be a serious risks posed to the ownership structure of the
Group. French regulation requires that more than half of the share capital and voting rights of medical laboratories be held
by medical biologists – this requirement is currently fulfilled by the fact that Stéphane Eimer is a medical biologist. If the
majority of the share capital of Laboratoire Eimer is no longer owned by Dr. Eimer, his shareholdings in Laboratoire Eimer
may be required to be transferred to other medical biologists outside the Group to align with regulatory requirements. The
transfer may be difficult to be completed in a timely manner and could significantly disrupt the business of the Group,
which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
See “Business—Our Corporate Structure (SEL/SELAS)” and “—We may not exercise full control over the operations of
_our French subsidiaries in which we have a minority voting interest, including the Issuer, and are dependent on the_
_biologists who own a majority voting interest in them to conduct the operations of such subsidiaries”._


-----

**_Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

We are subject to competition from other market participants.

We face competition from other laboratories based on the location of the collection sites and quality of services we are able
to offer to the patients or nurses in France and Luxembourg, doctors in Belgium or private insurers in Spain. To a more
limited degree, our business also faces competition from hospitals that are able to provide testing themselves.

We may also face competition from other laboratory companies seeking to acquire the same target companies that we are
considering. Such competition could trigger an increase in the price of acquisition and could adversely affect our ability to
acquire companies and successfully implement our strategy.

Furthermore, we face competition from the increase of more accessible diagnostic technology and services. As technology
develops and advances, it is likely that an increasing number of common and routine medical testing will be able to be
conducted at home, for example, at-home pregnancy tests have become increasingly common and accurate over the years,
thus reducing some of the demand for laboratory blood testing to determine pregnancy. Similarly, certain types of testing
services are also becoming more accessible through clinics, pharmacies and nurses, with the need for laboratory testing no
longer required. In the long-term, this could reduce demand for some of our high-volume medical lab tests and could
adversely affect our strategy and results of operations.

**_Failures of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of customers or business_**
**_opportunities._**

Information technology (or “IT”) systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business and across each of
our lines of business, including for test reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of medical data. Our
operations depend on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems. IT systems are vulnerable to damage
from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts and natural disasters. Moreover,
despite the security measures we have implemented, our IT systems may be subject to physical or electronic break-ins,
computer viruses and similar disruptive problems.

IT problems may impact our ability to process test orders, deliver test results, perform or bill for tests in a timely manner
or maintain the privacy of the medical data we collect. If we experience significant or recurring IT systems problems,
including with our implementation of standard laboratory or billing systems, our operations would be disrupted. If our
operations were so disrupted, it could adversely affect our reputation, expose us to litigation or regulatory sanction and
result in a loss of other customers and negatively affect our net sales.

A flood, fire, other natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, power failure, cyber-attack, computer virus or other catastrophe
affecting a portion of our IT system could have a material adverse impact on its business and its relations with customers.
Measures with the aim of remedying such disasters, safety and security measures, or measures for protecting service
continuity that have been undertaken or may be undertaken in the future by the Group, as well as the effects thereof on the
performance of its network, could be insufficient to avoid losses. The Group is insured against operating losses only up to
a capped amount, any disaster or other damage affecting the network of the Group could result in significant uninsured
losses. We are not separately covered under a cyber risk insurance policy. In the event of a power outage or other shortage,
we do not have a backup or alternative supply source for all of the Group’s network components. The occurrence of any
such event could cause interruptions in service or reduce capacity for customers, either of which could reduce the Group’s
net sales or cause the Group to incur additional expenses.

Additionally, although we typically work with the acquired laboratories to transition their IT systems to integrate with ours
on or prior to closing, they may continue to use their existing IT systems for an indefinite amount of time after their
acquisition. In this case, there is a risk that our operations could be disrupted due to any incompatibility among the
information technology systems we use for a period after closing, which could have an adverse effect on our business and
results of operations.


-----

**_Adverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base_**
**_and reputation._**

We have been involved, and may be involved in the future, in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business, including disputes concerning acquisitions, professional liability and employee-related matters, regulatory
matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and health insurance carriers regarding, among other things,
billing issues. Additionally, from time to time, disputes may arise with or in connection with the sellers of businesses we
acquire, some of whom may continue to hold interests in the company and/or management positions. Some of the
proceedings against us may involve claims for substantial amounts and could divert management’s attention from day to
day business operations to address such issues. Proceedings may result in substantial monetary damages, damage to our
reputation and decreased demand for our services, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The
ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid.

In some proceedings in which we are involved or could be involved, material amounts are claimed, or could potentially be
claimed, from us or our subsidiaries and affiliates. Any provisions we set aside in this respect in our financial statements
may prove insufficient if we were found liable, which could have material adverse consequences on our activities and
financial position (particularly on our operating results and cash flow) regardless of whether or not the underlying claim is
well founded.

Outcomes of the litigations in connection with the sellers of businesses we acquire which we may not be parties to may
also have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the period. For example, in
July 2019, we acquired shares in CBM25 from CBM25 Sellers and have consolidated the operations of CBM25 in our
consolidated financial statements. However, due to the pre-emption rights under an existing affiliation agreement between
CBM25 and a counterparty, and a recent court order from Tribunal Judiciaire of Besançon, the deadline of the relevant sale
and purchase agreement has lapsed on December 1, 2020. While none of the Biogroup companies are parties to the litigation
at Tribunal Judiciaire of Besançon, as a result, as of December 1, 2020, we no longer exercise de facto control over CBM25
and have therefore deconsolidated the operations of CBM25 from our consolidated financial statements and the CBM25
Consideration will be recorded as a claim against the CBM25 Sellers on our consolidated balance sheet going forward. For
the year ended December 31, 2020, the CBM25 contribution to our 2020 consolidated pro forma EBITDA amounted to
€7.6 million. See “Business—Legal Proceedings” for more information.

In general, it is possible that, in the future, new proceedings, whether or not connected with those currently underway, may
be initiated against us, our subsidiaries or our laboratory doctors, medical doctors or employees. Since such proceedings
may be lengthy and costly, they could also, regardless of their outcome, have adverse consequences on our activities,
financial position (particularly our results and cash position) and outlook.

**_Failure to bill timely or accurately for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

Billing for our business is a complex process involving several payers. Depending on the billing arrangement, the payer
may be a third party responsible for providing health insurance coverage to patients (such as national public health
insurance or a private medical insurance plan), a patient or other party (such as a clinics, a healthcare agency or an
employer) who outsourced testing to us, or a combination of these parties. Changes in laws and regulations and the payment
policies of third-party payers could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process. In addition, we must maintain
procedures to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in order to ensure that we bill properly for our testing,
adding to the cost of the billing process and our ability to collect payment. See “Business—Billing and Payment.”

**_Financial difficulties of certain of our clients or third-party payers may require us to write off debts._**

We encounter third-party credit risk where we are reliant on the ability of a third party to be able to pay for services we
provide. We are exposed to varying levels of third-party credit risk across our lines of business. In France and Belgium,
although the government sets prices for laboratory testing, a portion of the cost is not directly paid by the social security
systems. Based on the size of the private lab market in the industry report and the proportion of spending in the French
private medical testing market according to “Les dépenses de santé en 2020 —Résultats des comptes de la santé,” a report


-----

published in 2021 by Panorama de La Drees Santé, approximately 79.1% (or €4.9 billion) of spending in the French private
medical testing market was financed by the French social security system and the remainder was covered by private
insurance companies (approximately 17.2%, or €1.07 billion) and by the patient directly out-of-pocket (approximately
2.2%, or €0.138 billion) in 2020. In Belgium, the patient’s out-of-pocket patient expenses amount up to 30% of the total
price of the medical test, on average, and generally act as a deterrent against overspending on medical testing. As a result,
we are exposed to the risk of not being able to collect amounts due from patients who are unwilling or unable to pay the
portion of the cost for which they are responsible. Collection efforts for amounts due from outsourced tests can be difficult.
Significant or recurring incidents of bad debts would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Failure to comply with and liabilities arising under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could result_**
**_in the imposition on us of fines, penalties and other costs and the loss of our licensing, which could have a material_**
**_adverse effect upon our business._**

Our operations are subject to licensing and other requirements under EU, national and local laws and regulations relating
to the protection of the environment and human and occupational health and safety, including those requirements governing
the handling, transportation and disposal of medical samples and biological, infectious and hazardous waste, as well as
those relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. For example, we must meet strict requirements in all
jurisdictions in which we operate for the disposal of testing samples at authorized facilities and undergo regular audits from
national regulators in order to ensure compliance with mandated quality control standards. In addition, we must meet
extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for employees in medical laboratories who could be exposed to various
biological risks such as blood-borne pathogens (including HIV and the viruses that cause hepatitis). These requirements
include work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other
measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens.

The environmental, health and safety regulations to which we are subject, including those governing the disposal of medical
waste, are likely to become more stringent over time, and our costs to comply with these requirements are likely to increase.
Moreover, we could incur substantial costs and sanctions, including civil and criminal fines and penalties, enforcement
actions, or the suspension or termination of our licenses to operate as a result of violations of our responsibilities under
these laws and regulations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We also may become subject
to claims from employees or other persons, such as those alleging injury or illness resulting from exposure to the samples
or waste they handle.

**_Disruption, failure or unsuitable delivery of sample transportation services could adversely affect our business and_**
**_financial results._**

The proper handling of samples during collection and transportation is essential for maintaining their integrity and ensuring
safety from accidental exposure to potentially infectious microorganisms. The vehicles used to transport samples must
satisfy relevant legal, practical and technical requirements, which vary depending on the type of samples transported. These
requirements include, for example, the use of appropriate transport containers and packaging, the labeling of containers,
the manner in which samples and containers are stored in the vehicle, the temperature at which samples must be transported
and the duration of the journey. Drivers employed to transport samples must be trained to handle biological samples in
accordance with best practices and applicable laws and regulations. Mishandling the sample in the collection and
transportation process can increase the likelihood of errors in laboratory testing.

Efficient transportation of samples is key to our business. Our in-house testing business in France operates on a model of
several collection centers where samples are collected and then delivered to technical platforms where testing takes place.
We handle the transport of samples from collection centers to technical platforms through our internal logistics service, or
are supported by external logistics providers mainly for our Ile-de-France operations. In Belgium, our internal logistics
service is responsible for picking up samples at general practitioners’ or specialist doctors’ offices once or twice a day and
deliver them to our network of technical platforms. See “Business—Our Logistics” for more information on our logistics.
We depend on our internal and external (in the case of our Ile-de-France operations) logistics providers to maintain the
integrity of samples during the transportation. In the event of a fault on the part of our internal or external logistics provider,
this may increase errors in our laboratory testing and may result in damage to our reputation, claims against us and the loss
of customers, which would adversely affect results of operations, financial condition and prospects.


-----

**_Disruptions in the delivery of testing supplies could adversely affect us._**

We depend on effective supply and distribution networks of our suppliers to obtain necessary reagents and consumables
for our testing operations and for the maintenance of our testing equipment. Damage or disruption to such supply or
distribution capabilities due to labor strikes at suppliers, loss on non-delivery of such materials or any other reason could
impair our ability to process tests and provide customers with their results in a timely manner, which could damage our
reputation and adversely impact our results of operations. In particular, operations at our labs could be interrupted if, as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our suppliers become unable to deliver necessary personal protective equipment,
reagents or other supplies on time in the required quality. For example, at the beginning of the lockdown period in March
2020, there were delays in shipments of masks and other personal protective equipment (“PPE”), as well as testing reagents
and equipment for COVID-19 diagnostics. To the extent that we are unable to effectively manage such events if they occur,
or cannot financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, they could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Business interruption at one of our laboratory technical platforms could result in significant losses and reputational_**
**_damage to our business._**

We operate a large number of collection sites. While many of these are small, we also operate, and may operate in the
future, larger or strategically important technical platforms that are critical to our operations in France and Belgium. There
is a risk of business interruption at these sites, which could be the result of external factors such as natural disasters, fire,
vandalism or other unforeseen events. Business interruption could also be the result of internal factors such as failure to
comply with regulatory requirements and the resulting loss of authorizations to operate the technical platform. If our
operations at any of our technical platforms were to be disrupted or compromised for an extended period of time, it could
have a material adverse effect upon our business and our results of operations.

Business interruptions could have a significant adverse impact on our business, both by direct loss of net sales and profits
related to the affected collection site, and also through the reputational damage that such a business interruption could have
on our business. While we maintain business interruption insurance for most of our major locations, there can be no
assurance that it would adequately offset our losses in the event of a business interruption. In particular, our business
interruption insurance does not cover losses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Business interruptions could therefore
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Extreme weather conditions may affect our testing volume levels and, consequently, our net sales._**

The volume of tests that we complete depends in significant part on the ability of patients—who are often ill, elderly,
pregnant or have limited mobility—to travel to see a doctor or to a laboratory or test sample collection center. Accordingly,
unusual or inclement weather conditions, particularly those affecting ground transportation conditions, such as heavy snow,
have in the past caused, and may in the future cause, a decrease in demand for our testing services.

**_We are subject to stringent privacy laws and information security policies, and violation of the European Union’s data_**
**_privacy regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation, could subject us to significant fines and other sanctions._**

We receive, generate and store significant volumes of personal and sensitive information, such as patient medical
information, and are therefore subject to privacy and security regulations with respect to the uses and disclosures of
protected health information intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such information. Privacy
and security regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:

      - the circumstances under which use or disclosure of protected health information is permitted or required without
a specific authorization by the patient;

      - a patient’s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information;

      - the requirements to notify patients of privacy practices for protected health information;


-----

      - administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health
information; and

      - the protection of computing systems that store protected health information.

If we do not adequately safeguard confidential patient data or other protected health information, or if such information or
data are wrongfully used by us or disclosed to an unauthorized person or entity, our reputation may be damaged and we
may become subject to fines, penalties and litigation.

On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) on the protection of natural persons with regard
to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data came into effect. The GDPR requires EU-based
companies or companies that process personal data about EU subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”)
comply with a large number of obligations, which relate for example to (i) the processing of personal data including
transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, security, and confidentiality; (ii) the ability of the controller
to demonstrate compliance with such principles (accountability); (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis before the
processing; and (iv) rights of data subjects, such as, among others transparency, right of access, right to rectification, or
right to erasure.

The GDPR obligates companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the
privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies, or types of data. The GDPR
provides for substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements. Depending on the nature and gravity of the
breaches committed, fines can be up to €10 million or 2% of the previous year’s worldwide turnover, whichever is greater,
or €20 million or 4% of the previous year’s worldwide turnover, whichever is greater, particularly in the event of a breach
of the conditions applicable to consent and/or related to data subjects’ rights. In case of control by the supervisory
authorities, administrative fines are often not applicable before a formal order. The fine may be imposed instead of, or in
addition to, measures that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease the processing). The
GDPR, the national implementing legislation, i.e., the French data protection rules and the Belgian Data Protection Act of
July 30, 2018, and French and Belgian law in general also provide for a private right of action on data subjects for breaches
of data protection requirements and additional private enforcement mechanisms. For instance, supervisory authorities may
issue a public warning, as part of a control revealing infringements of the applicable data protection regulation, and in
parallel a public formal order to comply with the applicable regulation. Such sanction constitutes a reputational risk for the
data controller’s company. The failure to comply with these laws could subject us to significant administrative fines and
sanctions, as well as civil and criminal liability in some cases.

**_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance._**

We carry insurance of various types, including workers’ compensation, employment practices, pension related and general
liability coverage. We maintain insurance policies both at the Group level as well as policies for individual collection sites
that we operate through our various subsidiaries. While we seek to maintain appropriate levels of insurance, not all claims
are insurable and there can be no assurance that we will not experience major incidents of a nature that is not covered by
insurance. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is adequate, but there can be no assurance that
our insurance cover will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all liabilities to which we may subject.
We could, for example, be subject to substantial claims for damages upon the occurrence of several events within one
calendar year. In addition, our insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative development in our
claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost.

**_Labor disputes could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs._**

We are subject to the risk of labor disputes, which may disrupt our operations. Labor laws applicable to our business are
relatively rigorous. In numerous cases, labor laws provide for the strong protection of employees’ interests. In addition,
some of our employees are members of unions or, based on applicable regulations, represented by work councils or other
bodies. In many cases, we must inform, consult with and request the consent or opinion of union representatives or work
councils in managing, developing or restructuring certain aspects of our business. These labor laws and consultative


-----

procedures could limit our flexibility with respect to employment policy or economic reorganization and could limit our
ability to respond to market changes efficiently. Even where consultative procedures are not mandatory, important strategic
business decisions could be negatively received by some employees and employees’ representative bodies, which could
lead to labor actions that could disrupt our business.

Although we believe our relations with employees are good and French law in particular limits the ability of workers
involved in the provision of healthcare services (which would include certain of our employees) to go on strike, our
operations may nevertheless be materially affected by strikes, work stoppages, work slowdowns or other labor related
developments in the future, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Our employees benefit from collective bargaining agreements, and we may not be able to periodically
renegotiate collective agreements on acceptable terms. Settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in
the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements may adversely affect our labor costs,
productivity and flexibility.

**_The results of some entities are fully consolidated in our financial statements, despite the fact that we hold less than_**
**_50% of the voting rights and less than 100% of the financial rights for such entities._**

The results of our French subsidiaries are fully consolidated in our consolidated balance sheet and income statement despite
us owning, directly or indirectly, less than 50% of the voting rights of our French laboratory subsidiaries. See "—We may
_not exercise full control over the operations of our French subsidiaries in which we have a minority voting interest,_
_including the Issuer, and are dependent on the biologists who own a majority voting interest in them to conduct the_
_operations of such subsidiaries.” However, although CAB, our wholly owned subsidiary, holds, directly or indirectly, less_
than a majority of the voting rights in these French laboratory subsidiaries, the bylaws of these entities allow CAB to hold,
directly or indirectly, between approximately 51.0% and 99.9% of the financial rights in such entities, in certain cases
through share capital.

In addition, because CAB owns, directly or indirectly, less than 100% of the financial rights in certain of our French
laboratory subsidiaries, we have access to only a portion of the EBITDA and assets of these entities. See note 4.2 of the
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for more information.

**_Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with French GAAP, and any transition to IFRS in the future could_**
**_impair the comparability of our reported and historical results._**

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with French GAAP, which differs in certain
significant respects from IFRS. We have not presented in this offering memorandum a full reconciliation of our French
GAAP consolidated financial statements to IFRS consolidated financial statements. As there are significant differences
between French GAAP and IFRS, if we were to prepare our consolidated financial statements based on IFRS instead of
French GAAP, there could be substantial differences in our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows,
including levels of indebtedness. Accordingly, if we transition our financial reporting standards, accounting policies and
accounting adjustment from French GAAP to IFRS, the comparability of our reported and historical results could be
significantly impaired.

We are allowed under the Indenture to elect to report exclusively in IFRS. If we do so, the covenant calculations under the
Indenture is based on IFRS and our covenants may become more or less restrictive from time to time, depending upon the
effect of the standards we adopt. This could result in our being able to take actions that might be to your detriment, such
as incurring greater amounts of debt than would otherwise have been possible had we continued to report in French GAAP.
For a discussion of certain differences between French GAAP and IFRS as applied by us, see “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Certain differences between French GAAP and IFRS”._

**Risks Related to Our Capital Structure**

**_Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our businesses._**

We currently have, and after the issuance of the Additional Notes will continue to have, a significant amount of outstanding
debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of June 30, 2021 (on a pro forma basis), and as adjusted to give effect
to the Offering, the Additional Existing Term Loan Facility drawn in July 2021 and the application of the proceeds
therefrom, we would have had €3,218 million of outstanding total indebtedness, including €350.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of Additional Notes offered hereby, €800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Existing Senior
Secured Notes, €250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Existing Senior Notes and €1,750.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, we will be permitted to incur additional
indebtedness under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility in the future, as well as other significant additional indebtedness
to fund acquisitions as set out in “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”. Our
significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations and for you as a holder of Notes,
including, but not limited to:

      - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debts and liabilities;

      - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thus
reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund acquisitions, organic growth projects and for other general
corporate purposes;

      - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry conditions;

      - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage or greater financial
resources than we have;

      - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business and industry;

      - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

      - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities; and

      - limiting, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and
increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt
obligations, including the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to fund acquisitions,
working capital expenditures and other expenses will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate
cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic,
competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate
sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to service our debt or fund our future acquisitions or other
working capital expenditures.

For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources”._

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the_**
**_Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement contain
restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant
qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Under the Indenture, in addition to specified permitted


-----

indebtedness, we will be able to incur additional indebtedness so long as on a pro forma basis our fixed charge coverage
ratio (as defined in the Indenture) is at least 2.00 to 1.00. Under the Indenture, in the event such indebtedness is secured
indebtedness, we will be able to incur additional senior secured indebtedness so long as on a _pro forma_ basis our
consolidated senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in the Indenture, which, among other things, excludes certain
specified permitted indebtedness from the calculation of such ratio and is calculated on a net basis) is no more than 5.75 to
1.00. We will also be able to refinance indebtedness outstanding under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility with debt
incurred in compliance with these ratios and then be able to draw amounts under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility at
a time when we do not meet these ratios. The terms of the Indenture permit us to incur future debt that may have
substantially the same covenants as, or covenants that are more restrictive than, those of the Indenture. Moreover, some of
the debt we may incur in the future could be structurally senior to the Notes and secured by collateral that does not secure
the Notes. In addition, the Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement do not prevent us from incurring obligations that
do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-
related risks described in this offering memorandum.

**_French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest on our_**
**_indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness._**

As a general rule, pursuant to Article 39, 1-1° of the French Code général des impôts (the “French Tax Code”), expenses
incurred by a French company are deductible provided, among other conditions, that (i) they are incurred in its direct
corporate interest and (ii) they correspond to actual and justified expenses. In this respect, French case law has developed
the concept of “abnormal act of management”, according to which the expenses incurred by a French company in relation
with transactions that are not aligned with its direct corporate interest are not tax deductible.

Given the complex intragroup transactions within the Group, the risk that the French tax authorities might try to challenge
the deductibility of interest expenses resulting from intragroup financings (e.g., interest expenses on an intragroup loan),
by claiming that such transactions (i) are not performed in the direct corporate interest of the French company of the Group
at the level of which these interest expenses are incurred or (ii) have not been set at arm’s length conditions, cannot be
excluded.

Under Article 39, 1-3° of the French Tax Code, the deduction of interest paid by a French company to lenders who are
direct shareholders of such company but are not related parties to such company within the meaning of Article 39, 12 of
the French Tax Code, is subject to the conditions that (i) the share capital of the borrowing company is fully paid-in and
(ii) the interest rate on the corresponding loans does not exceed a rate equal to the annual average rate of floating rate loans
granted by financial establishments for a minimum term of two years (1.18% with respect to fiscal years closed on
December 31, 2020).

By exception, pursuant to Article 212, I-a) of the French Tax Code, the deductibility of interest paid on loans granted by a
related party within the meaning of Article 39, 12 of the French Tax Code is deductible within the limit of the interest that
would have resulted from the application of the maximum tax rate computed as per Article 39, 1-3° of the French Tax
Code, or, if higher, from the rate that the borrower could have obtained from independent financial establishments in similar
conditions.

Pursuant to Article 39, 12 of the French Tax Code, two entities will be regarded as related if (i) one of the entities holds
directly or indirectly the majority of the other entity’s share capital or actually exercises the power of decision in that entity
or (ii) both entities are placed under the conditions defined in (i) to the control of a same third entity.

In both cases (i.e. non-deductibility under Article 39, 1-3° and 212, I-a) of the French Tax Code, non-deductible interest
might be re-characterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, which may be
subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis, 2 of the French tax Code, at (i) the standard corporate income
tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the second paragraph of Article 219, I of the French Tax Code (i.e. 26.5% for fiscal
years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and 25% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2022) for payments
benefiting legal persons or (ii) the rate of 75% for payments made in non-cooperative jurisdictions within the meaning of
Article 238-0 A of the French tax Code other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A (subject in
any case to more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty).


-----

Pursuant to Article 212 _bis of the French Tax Code (which has transposed into French law the interest limitation rules_
provided for by Article 4 of the Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 of July 12, 2016 (the “ATAD 1 Directive”)), subject
to certain exceptions and safe harbor clauses, net financial charges (i.e. the portion of financial charges exceeding financial
income) accrued by a company that is subject to French corporate income tax, without distinction between third-party debts
and related-party debts, are deductible from their taxable result only up to a maximum amount equal to the higher of: (i)
€3 million (to be adjusted on a prorata temporis basis for fiscal years which do no last twelve months) and (ii) 30% of the
company’s result before deduction of carried-forward tax losses and before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
adjusted for tax purposes (the “Tax EBITDA”) generated in the same fiscal year (the “General Limitation”).

Where the company is a member of a consolidated group for accounting purposes and is able to demonstrate that the ratio
between its own funds and all of its total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the
consolidated group for accounting purposes to which it belongs, net financial expenses non-deductible under the General
Limitation are deductible up to 75% of their amount (the “Safeguard Clause”).

By exception, where the average amount of the sums made available to a company by all related parties (directly or
indirectly) during a fiscal year exceeds in respect of that fiscal year one and a half times the amount of its own funds (i.e.
where the company is thinly capitalized), the net financial expenses borne by such company are deductible for:

       - a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its Tax EBITDA and (ii) €3 million multiplied by a ratio
equal to (A) the average amount of the sums made available to the company by all unrelated parties (directly or
indirectly) increased by one and a half times the amount of its own funds (assessed either at the beginning or at the
closing date of the fiscal year) divided by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the
company during said fiscal year (the “Thin-Cap Limit A”);

       - the balance up to the higher of (i) 10% of its Tax EBITDA and (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the
average amount of the sums made available to the company by all related parties (directly or indirectly) exceeding
one and a half times the amount of its own funds (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal
year) divided by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal
year (the “Thin-Cap Limit B”).

However, these thin-capitalization rules do not apply if the company demonstrates that the overall indebtedness ratio of
the consolidated group for accounting purposes (i.e. the ratio existing between the total amount of the consolidated group’s
debts (with the exception of those owed to companies belonging to the consolidated group) and the amount of the
consolidated group’s own funds) to which it belongs is higher than or equal to its own indebtedness ratio (i.e. the ratio
existing between the total amount of its debts and the amount of its own funds).

Net financial expenses in respect of previous fiscal years that are not deductible under the General Limitation, the Safeguard
Clause and the Thin-Cap Limit A as well as a third of net financial expenses in respect of previous fiscal years that are not
deductible under the Thin-Cap Limit B may be deducted up to an amount equal to the positive difference between (i) the
General Limitation in respect of the fiscal year or, where the company is thinly capitalized, the Thin-Cap Limit A in respect
of the fiscal year and (ii) the net financial expenses of the fiscal year reduced, as the case may be, by those subject to the
Thin-Cap Limit B. Net financial expenses not deductible under these provisions can be carried forward indefinitely and
deducted in the future under the same conditions (the “Carry-Forward Clause”).

The unused deduction capacity of a company that is not thinly capitalized (corresponding to the positive difference between
the General Limitation and the net financial expenses deductible under the General Limitation, the Safeguard Clause and
the Carry-Forward Clause) in respect of a given fiscal year may be used over the subsequent five fiscal years to deduct
from the result of those fiscal years the amount of net financial expenses not deductible under the General Limitation and
the Safeguard Clause. This unused deduction capacity may not be used to deduct carried forward financial expenses in
accordance with the Carry-Forward Clause.

Under Article 223 B bis of the French Tax Code, the abovementioned limitations apply mutatis mutandis to companies
that belong to French tax-consolidated groups with respect to amounts made available by creditors outside such group. The
Finance Act for 2020 has transposed into French law the measures to tackle hybrid mismatches provided for in Articles 9,


-----

9 bis and 9 ter of the Atad 1 Directive as amended by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 of May 29, 2017 (the “Atad 2
**Directive”). These measures apply to fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2020, except for some of them which would**
be applicable as from January 1, 2022.

Articles 205 B et seq. of the French Tax Code implementing ATAD 2 provide limitations on interest deductions in the
event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in
the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”) or (ii) a deduction of the same
payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a
“double deduction”). Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises”, except for
the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement whose terms include the valuation of the mismatch effect or
an arrangement that was designed to produce the same consequences as a hybrid mismatch, subject to certain conditions).
If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied
to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income
if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the
deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity.

In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions will also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring
to arrangements where an entity is deemed to be transparent for tax purposes by the Member State in which it is
incorporated or established but the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” holding directly or
indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit are established
qualify the entity as a taxable person. Where a hybrid entity of a reverse hybrid mismatch is incorporated or established in
France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax or taxable pursuant to the conditions
provided for by Article 8 of the French Tax Code, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State.

The abovementioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in France and,
as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility._**

Our Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indenture contain covenants which impose significant restrictions on the way we
operate, including restrictions on our ability to:

      - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;

      - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

      - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures;

      - prepay or redeem subordinated debt;

      - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

      - create unrestricted subsidiaries;

      - agree to limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions;

      - sell assets, or consolidate or merge with or into other companies;

      - sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis;

      - issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries; and

      - create or incur certain liens.


-----

These covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or
regulatory developments or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions
could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations; pursue acquisitions, investments or alliances; restructure our
organization; or finance our capital needs.

**_Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Indenture or the Existing Senior_**
**_Notes Indenture, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default which could_**
**_materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations._**

The Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement will require us to comply with
various covenants, including a springing financial covenant in respect of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility requiring
us to maintain a specified leverage ratio which will be tested when loans under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
aggregate 40% of the total commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility on the last day of a financial quarter.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement”. Our ability to meet this financial ratio could be
affected by a deterioration in our operating results, as well as by events beyond our control, including, without limitation,
any unfavorable economic conditions, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet this ratio. Moreover, the
Senior Facilities Agreement includes certain events of default (including, among other things, events of default for breaches
of representations and warranties, an event of default for our failure to make principal payments when due on certain other
debt and financial covenants breach) that are in addition to the events of default set forth in the Indenture and the Existing
Senior Notes Indenture. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the agent
under the Senior Facilities (if directed by the majority lenders thereunder (or majority lenders under the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility in the case of a financial covenant default)) could, amongst other things, terminate any available facilities,
cancel any undrawn commitments and declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and any
other sums then payable, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under other debt instruments, including the Notes,
that contain cross acceleration or cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand in the
event that acceleration occurs under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In these circumstances, our assets and cash flow may
not be sufficient to repay in full that debt and our other debt, including the Notes then outstanding, if some or all of these
instruments were accelerated, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we might not be able to repay our
obligations under the Notes in such an event.

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has limited revenue generating operations of its own and will depend on cash_**
**_from the operating companies of our combined Group to be able to make payments on the Notes or the Guarantees._**

The Issuer is a holding company with limited, business operations of its own. The Issuer is dependent upon the cash flow
from its operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including
its obligations under the Notes or the Guarantees. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will
depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under
applicable law. The subsidiaries of the Issuer, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law
to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including
the Notes and the Guarantees. While the Indenture limits the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual
restrictions on its ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant
qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law. In addition, the subsidiaries
of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries and effectively subordinated_**
**_to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not secure the Notes._**

Certain of our subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes. Our subsidiaries will not have any obligations to pay amounts due
under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose unless they guarantee the Notes or grant security interests in
this respect. Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders of non-
Guarantor subsidiaries, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are
made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors of the Issuer and Guarantors.


-----

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or
is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

      - the creditors of the Issuer and Guarantors (including the holders of the respective Notes) will have no right to
proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and

      - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders
will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before
the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive any
distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each related Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including depositors, trade
creditors and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries. Our restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the
Additional Notes (each on an unconsolidated basis) are required to pass an annual Guarantor coverage test under the terms
of the Indenture. The Guarantor coverage test was satisfied based on the financial information for the six months ended
June 30, 2021.

As of June 30, 2021, the subsidiaries of the Issuer not guaranteeing the Notes had €13.6 million of third-party debt
outstanding.

Any of the debt that our non-Guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future in accordance with the Indenture will rank
structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees and any debt we incur that is secured on property or assets that do not
secure the Notes will be effectively senior to the Notes to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such
indebtedness.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control,_**
**_and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

Our ability to make payments on or to refinance the Notes or our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating
performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends on general economic, financial, competitive, market,
regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our debt obligations, and
additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when
due, or to refinance such debts, including the Notes. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources
are insufficient to pay obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

      - reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures;

      - sell assets;

      - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

      - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We may not be
able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all.

In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such time. Any
refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us to comply with more
onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments
and the Indenture may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. Furthermore, we may be unable to find
alternative financing, and even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or
acceptable to us. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially
reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes. In that event,


-----

borrowings under other debt agreement or instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions may
become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all our debts, including the Notes.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would
likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence
of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of
material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness, including under
the Indenture, restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets. We may not be able to consummate certain dispositions or obtain
the funds that we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset
dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due.

**_We are exposed to interest rate risks, and such rates may adversely affect our debt service obligations._**

A portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate, and we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates,
primarily under the Senior Facilities Agreement, which is based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) and
the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in
the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital
expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_Changes in, or uncertainty relating to, the EURIBOR calculation process may adversely affect the interest the Issuer_**
**_pays on its Senior Facilities._**

The Senior Facilities bear interest at interest rates based on EURIBOR, which are deemed to be “benchmarks” and have
been the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms
are already effective while others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform
differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.

Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) applies, subject to certain transitional provisions, to the
provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark within the EU (which,
for these purposes, includes the United Kingdom). Among other things, it (i) requires benchmark administrators to be
authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed)
and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered
(or, if non-EU based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed).

The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the Senior Facilities if the methodology or other terms of the
benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could,
among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or
level of the relevant benchmark. More broadly, any of the international or national reforms, or the general increased
regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the
setting of a benchmark and complying with any such regulations or requirements.

The elimination of any benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or
law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which a benchmark is determined, which could require
an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark
(including, but not limited to, the Senior Facilities). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation
thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the
Group’s ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. Separately, the euro risk free-rate working
group for the euro area has published a set of guiding principles and high level recommendations for fallback provisions
in, amongst other things, new euro denominated cash products (including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding
principles indicate, among other things, that continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust
fallback provisions) may increase the risk to the euro area financial system.


-----

Based on the foregoing, investors should in particular be aware that any of the reforms or pressures described above or
any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it
to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be.

It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, EURIBOR will continue to be supported going
forward. This may cause EURIBOR to perform differently than in the past, and may have other consequences which cannot
be predicted. Such factors may have (without limitation) the following effects on certain benchmarks: (i) discouraging
market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a benchmark; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or
methodologies used in the benchmark; and/or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the benchmark. Any of the above changes
or any other consequential changes as a result of international or national reforms or other initiatives or investigations, may
result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the interest we pay
on borrowings under the Senior Facilities. To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest
expense could correspondingly increase, thereby reducing our cash flow.

**_We may not be able to finance a change of control offer. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may have the_**
**_right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the_**
**_tender._**

The Indenture requires us to make an offer to purchase the Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase if we experience certain specified
change of control events. The Senior Facilities Agreement also provides for a mandatory prepayment to lenders thereunder
to repay them at par if we experience certain specified change of control events. The source of funds for any offer to
purchase Notes, or repay lenders under the Senior Facilities, required as a result of any such event would be available cash
or cash generated from operating activities or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds
provided by our subsidiaries. Sufficient funds may not be available at the time of any such events to make any required
purchases of the Notes tendered and we may not be able to secure access to enough cash to finance the required purchases
of the Notes tendered. Our failure to effect a change of control offer when required would constitute an event of default
under the Indenture or the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the other
indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement. A change of control may result in an event of default and/or mandatory
prepayment obligation under, or acceleration of, our other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an
offer could cause a default under our other indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. In addition, certain
events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities may not constitute a change of control under the
Indenture. The future indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions on certain
events that would constitute a change of control.

Further, if pursuant to a change of control offer, holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes, the Indenture permits the Issuer, at its option, to redeem
the remaining outstanding Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any. As a consequence, holders of the Notes may be required to surrender the Notes against their
will at a price equivalent to that paid to tendering holders and may not receive the return expected.

Under the definition contained in the Indenture, a change of control may include a disposition of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole to any person. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries
taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is
required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. Furthermore, certain important corporate events that might adversely
affect the value of the Notes (including certain reorganizations, restructurings and mergers) would not constitute a “change
of control” under the Indenture. Furthermore, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of
control under the Indenture is not be deemed to be a change of control if at the time our consolidated net leverage ratio is
less than certain specified levels. For a complete description of the events that would constitute a “change of control” under
Notes, see the section entitled “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”.


-----

**_The interests of our ultimate principal shareholder may be inconsistent with your interests._**

The interests of our principal shareholder, Dr. Stéphane Eimer (together with his family members), could conflict with the
interests of investors in the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when
due. Our principal shareholder could cause us to pursue acquisitions or divestitures and other transactions or to make large
dividend payments (subject to limitations in the Indenture and in the shareholders’ agreements entered into with our
investors) or other distributions or payments to him as the shareholder, even though such transactions may involve
increased risk for the holders of the Notes. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that our principal shareholder will not
sell all or any part of his shareholding at any time nor that he will not look to reduce his holding by means of a sale or
otherwise. Such divestitures may not trigger a “Change of Control” under the Indenture.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euros. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a
currency other than euros, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors,
possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which such investors measure
the return on their investments. These changes may be due to economic, political and other factors over which we have no
control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their
investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a
loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which such investors measure
the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars by U.S. holders
(as defined in “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) may also have important tax
consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See _“Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal_
_Income Tax Considerations.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision,_**
**_suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the
potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that
may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject
to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will
remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit
rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time
of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and
terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and their business
is conducted entirely outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are
non-residents of the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New
York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or under the Indenture, you may be unable to effect
service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In
addition, because all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and all or a majority of
the assets of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce
against them judgments obtained in the U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court,
actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of
the United States. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgments.”


-----

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of particular assets_**
**_could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Notes will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain
exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral to the extent that
it relates to their assets. So long as no acceleration event has occurred, and subject to certain conditions, the Issuer and the
Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course
activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and
making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt_**
**_in the future, may create or restart hardening periods (i.e., the periods of time following the granting of security interests_**
**_during which such security interests may be challenged in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions)._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Guarantees may create hardening periods for such security
interests in certain jurisdictions. In addition, the Indenture specifically permits the release and retaking of security that
constitutes Collateral in connection with the incurrence of permitted debt if certain conditions are satisfied. The granting
of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen
such hardening periods. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each
new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be
enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or
ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and
_the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries as
additional Guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of
holders of the Notes.

Given that some security interests to be granted by certain Guarantors may be granted after certain Guarantors accede to
the Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement, this could trigger the hardening period issues described in “Limitations
_on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_You may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the pledges over shares of French companies_**
**_by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of shares rather than by a sale of such Collateral in a_**
**_public auction._**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and unpaid to
it. The pledges over financial securities (whether in the form of a pledge over a financial securities account or in the form
of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) of French companies may be enforced at the option of the secured
creditor either by a sale of the pledged financial securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the
secured creditors), by judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or by contractual foreclosure (attribution conventionnelle
_or pacte commissoire) of the financial securities to the secured creditor, following which the secured creditor becomes the_
legal owner of the pledged financial securities. In a proceeding for attribution judiciaire or attribution conventionnelle, an
expert is appointed (whether contractually or by the court) to value the collateral (in this case, the pledged financial
securities) and if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt under the pledge, the secured creditor is
required to pay the relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the difference between the value of the financial securities and the
amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured
creditor from a subsequent sale of the Collateral.

Also, if the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether an attribution judiciaire or an attribution
_conventionnelle), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed financial securities._


-----

Consequently, in the event the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the Senior
Facilities and the holders of the Notes or as creditor of the parallel debt) decides to, and is entitled to, enforce the financial
securities pledges through a judicial or contractual foreclosure and if the value of such financial securities exceeds the
amount of the secured debt under the pledge, the security agent (acting on its own behalf as well as for the benefit of the
lenders under the Senior Facilities and the holders of the Notes or as creditor of the parallel debt) may be required to pay
to the relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the value by which such financial securities exceeds the amount of secured debt
under the pledge.

If the value of such financial securities is less than the amount of the secured debt under the pledge, the relevant amount
owed to the relevant creditor will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such financial securities, and the remaining
amount owed to such creditor will be unsecured.

If the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Facilities and the holders
of the Notes or as creditor of the parallel debt) declines to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the financial
securities, a sale of the pledged financial securities could be undertaken by public auction in accordance with applicable
law. Due to the French regulatory restrictions set forth in the immediately following risk factor, the security agent (acting
on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Facilities and the holders of the Notes or as creditor
of the parallel debt) is likely to have an incentive to enforce the pledged financial securities through a public auction. Since
public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern (as the latter will not be sold pursuant
to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the
basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups
of companies) it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the Group as a
going concern.

**_Your ability to enforce the pledges over financial securities of our French laboratory companies will be limited by_**
**_French law restrictions on the ownership of laboratory companies and future regulatory changes may have an impact_**
**_on the value of the Collateral._**

French law limits persons who are not medical biologists and entities that are not laboratory companies from holding, in
aggregate, more than 25% of a laboratory company’s share capital and voting rights. Moreover, external medical biologist
and entities that are laboratory companies cannot hold, in aggregate, more than 49.99% of the share capital and 49.99% of
the voting rights in a laboratory company, unless they are incorporated as “5.1” laboratory companies pursuant to a
grandfathering exception. “5.1” laboratory companies in France (including CAB and certain subsidiaries of our Group) are
allowed to have (i) external medical biologist and entities that are laboratory companies to hold, in aggregate, up to 99.99%
of the share capital and 49.99% of the voting rights in such laboratory company and (ii) transfers of the securities of such
laboratory company to be subject to a legal right of first refusal from the in-house medical biologists. See “Business—Our
_Corporate Structure (SEL/SELAS)” and “Regulation—France” for more information._

If the Security Agent seeks enforcement of a pledge over financial securities in a SEL not benefitting from the
grandfathering exception, at least 50.01% of the shares will need to be acquired by laboratory biologists practicing within
the SEL whose shares are being sold, which will decrease the pool of potential buyers, result in a lower sale price. In the
case of a SEL benefitting from the grandfathering exception, the Security Agent may be obligated to offer the shares to the
in-house biologists in the first instance. This could also limit the attractiveness of the acquisition of the laboratory to other
potential buyers. In any event, the Security Agent or any other purchasers (other than the in-house biologists practicing
within such SELs) will hold a minority of the voting rights. In addition, relevant law restricts the ability of such persons or
entities to own shares of SELs operating medical laboratories, thus further reducing the number of potential buyers of our
medical laboratories in connection with the enforcement of the Collateral. These restrictions may limit significantly the
amount you are able to recover under the Collateral in the case of an event of default.

As a result, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce a pledge on the share capital of a French SEL operating medical
laboratories will be limited because it will be able to hold, following a judicial or contractual foreclosure, a maximum of
25% of the share capital of each such SEL, which shares have been pledged.


-----

We may issue new shares to in-house biologists in order to comply with any new law or regulation regarding the
participation of in-house biologists in the share capital of SELs operating medical laboratories. Since the new shares to be
issued to in-house biologists practicing within such SELs would not be pledged to secure the Notes and the guarantees, the
percentage of shares of our French SELs that constitute part of the Collateral securing the Notes would decrease following
such issuance and would be limited to a minority of the share capital of our SELs whose shares have been pledged as
Collateral for the Notes. See “—Risks Related to Our Business—Current or future regulatory changes in France, and
_disputes initiated by the competent administrative authorities or professional associations, may affect our ability to develop_
_our network of French laboratories through acquisitions, make us more dependent on in-house biologists to check_
_operations carried out by SELs, and call into question our organizational and legal structure” and “Regulation—France.”_

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The Notes will be secured by the same Collateral securing our obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain
hedging obligations.

The holders of the Notes do not have separate rights to enforce the Collateral. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, and
the Indenture, a common security agent will serve as the Security Agent for the secured parties under the Senior Facilities,
the Notes (including the Existing Senior Notes and the Additional Notes) and the hedging arrangements (if any) with regard
to the shared Collateral (as applicable). The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent will, subject to
certain limited exceptions, act to enforce the security interests in the Collateral and take instructions from the relevant
secured creditors in respect of the Collateral only at the direction of an “instructing group”. In addition, the holders of the
Notes are not able to instruct the Security Agent, force a sale of Collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies
of a secured creditor under the relevant security documents unless it comprises an instructing group, which, in turn, will
depend on the quantum of the creditors in respect of the drawn and undrawn uncanceled commitments under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the creditors in respect of certain hedging obligations and the creditors in respect of other future
senior secured obligations incurred. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that an “instructing group” is certain classes of
creditors which will vote together as part of an instructing group in relation to any consent or instructions relating to the
enforcement of Collateral or where any matter requires the consent of or instruction from a certain class of creditors.

Disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes and creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement, counterparties
to certain hedging arrangements, if any, and/or holders of any permitted _pari passu secured indebtedness as to the_
appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the Collateral. In such an event, the
holders of the Notes would be bound by any decisions of the relevant instructing group, which may result in enforcement
action in respect of the Collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to
such holders of the Notes. The creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the hedge counterparties and holders
of any other senior secured debt entitled to provide instructions regarding enforcement may have interests that are different
from the interests of holders of the Notes and such creditors may elect to pursue their remedies under the security documents
at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions_**
**_may prove difficult._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of France; the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France and Belgium; the
Collateral includes the shares of certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of those jurisdictions, and certain
present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries in respect of debtors in
certain of these jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or a similar event, proceedings could
be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral are likely to be
subject to insolvency and administrative laws of multiple jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able
to effectively enforce your rights in such complex proceedings. In addition, the multi-jurisdictional nature of enforcement
over the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer and the Guarantors may be
materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United States, including in the areas of rights
of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest, the duration of


-----

proceeding and preference periods. The application of these laws, and any conflict between them, could call into question
whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce
your rights under the guarantees and the security documents in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may
receive.

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for the Notes_**
**_and future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” Not
all of our assets secure the Notes, and the Indenture allows the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure any future
senior secured indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture) permitted to be incurred under the Indenture (which may be
structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees) with the property and assets of the restricted subsidiaries that do not
secure the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations
under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt
and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with
respect to any property or assets that is or are excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes or such secured debt.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under Notes and such_**
**_Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

The Notes will be secured by pledges over the financial securities held by the Issuer and certain Guarantors in certain of
our subsidiaries, certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries
to certain subsidiaries and certain banks accounts held by the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries. If we default on the
Notes, holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets underlying the security interests
granted in favor of holders of the Notes.

In the event of an enforcement of the Security Documents relating to the Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets
underlying the Security Documents may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations of Issuer and Guarantors with respect
to the Notes and the Guarantees. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering.
The value of the assets underlying the Security Documents will also depend on many factors, including, among other
things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability
to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability
of buyers.

The Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment
of the Notes, in part because most of these assets may not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less than their
value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be
substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as
France, include restrictions on persons who may own or operate medical laboratories. In the event of foreclosure, the
transfer of medical laboratories (or the ownership of an entity holding medical laboratories) may be prohibited or only
permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers.
Furthermore, the transfer of medical laboratories may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory
consents, approvals or filings. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As
a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may
be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral
will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our
subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity's shares that have been pledged because all of
the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in
the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of
value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of
the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid
from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the
Issuer's and the Guarantors' remaining assets. See “—Your ability to enforce the pledges over financial securities of our


-----

_French laboratory companies will be limited by French law restrictions on the ownership of laboratory companies and_
_future regulatory changes may have an impact on the value of the Collateral.”_

The Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral.
To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or
not permitted by the Indenture or the security documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with
respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.
Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture, holders of such additional Notes would benefit from the same
collateral as the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Additional Notes being offered hereby, thereby
diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.

**_In certain jurisdictions, security over the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the_**
**_holders of the Notes._** **_The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

In France where parallel debt obligations are, or a separate appointment of the security trustee for local law purposes is,
customary or required, the security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes
and the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will
be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that only the Security
Agent has the right to enforce such security documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security
interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through
the Trustee, who will provide instructions (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) to the Security Agent.

The security over the Collateral in France where parallel debt obligations are, or a separate appointment of the security
trustee for local law purposes, is customary or required, will be granted in favor of the Security Agent as beneficiary of
parallel debt obligations (“Parallel Debt”) created to satisfy a requirement that the Security Agent, as grantee of certain
types of collateral, be a creditor of the relevant Guarantor. The Parallel Debt is in the same amount and payable at the same
time as the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, including any additional Notes (the “Principal
**Obligations”). Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and**
any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. The Security Agent
will have, pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim against the Issuer for the full principal amount of the Notes. The holders
of the Notes will not be entitled to enforce such security except through the Security Agent. Holders of the Notes bear some
risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. The Parallel Debt obligations referred to
above are contained in the Intercreditor Agreement, which is governed by English law. There can be no assurance that such
a structure will be effective before the relevant courts since there is no judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy, and
therefore the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted as the Collateral may be invalid or
unenforceable with respect to the claims of any person who is not a party to the relevant security document, including all
holders of the Notes.

In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will
provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the
Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the parallel debt structure
are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the
security interest in the Collateral.

Further, under a parallel debt structure, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency
or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the parallel debt.

The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following default
or events of default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes.

**_Investors' rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected, and its
priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security, as applicable. The
liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are
unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. The Security Agent will not be under any obligation to
take any steps to perfect any such liens.

**_The insolvency laws of France and Belgium may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States_**
**_or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security_**
**_Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

On the Additional Notes Issue Date as described elsewhere in this offering memorandum, our obligations under the
Additional Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured by security interests over the Collateral. The Issuer is
organized under the laws of France and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France and Belgium. There is a
rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in the Council of the European Union Regulation No.
134612000 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In addition, the Collateral
will include a pledge over the shares in certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of France and Belgium and
pledges of certain present and future intercompany loan receivables and bank accounts held by Laboratoire Eimer, the
Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries and third-party Collateral providers (as applicable) incorporated under the laws of
France and Belgium.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or
other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In particular, the French bankruptcy laws and regulations are unfavorable
to creditors in many respects. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of the Issuer's
subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions
insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable
principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could
limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor and the
enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the
Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and
insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the
relevant jurisdiction's fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may
challenge the guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at
an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a
court, if it makes certain findings, to:

      - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor's obligations under its Guarantee or the Security Interests
provided by such Guarantor;

      - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any Security
Interest to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor's creditors; and

      - take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference,
transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can
ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee
or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting
a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the


-----

Guarantors under the Security Documents (as defined herein) will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as
to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the
possibility that the entire Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be
extinguished. See also “—The Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses
_that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability” below._

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example,
need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the Guarantor:

      - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current
or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency;

      - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent businessman as a
shareholder of such Guarantor would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or where the relevant beneficiary
of the Guarantee or Security Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor was insolvent or a filing for
insolvency had been made; or

      - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee or Security
Interest on the basis that the Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the
Guarantor's benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance
of the Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii)
was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor's assets were unreasonably
small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as
and when they would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in different jurisdictions, be
considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or created any Security Interest if:

      - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

      - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

      - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities,
including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute.

Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance
as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantees
were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine
that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor
was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the
Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees and Security Interests,
see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.”_

**_The Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect_**
**_their validity and enforceability._**

Our Guarantors are organized under the laws of France and Belgium. Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee
against any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case
may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate
benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally.


-----

The obligations of the Guarantors incorporated in France and Belgium and the enforcement of each such Guarantee will
be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction,
to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor's corporate interests, or the burden of such
Guarantee exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor, or such Guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance or
thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor to
contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. An increase in the amount of debt that benefits from
such Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Guarantee will dilute the value of such Guarantee
to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Notes.

Accordingly, enforcement of any such Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be subject to certain defenses
available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Guarantees designed to
ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors. These laws and defenses may include
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, a Guarantor's liability under its Guarantee could be
materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law applicable to it.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing, or providing security in relation to,
indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. Under French
corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee or security unenforceable and, if payment had already been
made under the relevant guarantee, or any proceeds have been obtained from the enforcement of any security, require that
the recipient return the payment or any proceeds so obtained to the relevant guarantor or security provider, if the court
found that the French guarantor or security provider did not receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the
transaction involving the grant of the guarantee or security as a whole. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter
which must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor or security
provider and whether the amounts guaranteed or secured are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as
to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Under Belgian financial assistance rules, a limited liability company is only allowed to advance funds, grant loans or
security interests, with a view to the acquisition or subscription of its own capital shares of profit shares by third parties, if
certain strict conditions as set out in the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations have been complied with. Any
guarantee or security interest granted by a Guarantor incorporated in Belgium which constitutes a breach of the provisions
on financial assistance as defined by Article 5:152 or 7:22 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations, whichever
is applicable, might be null and void and therefore not enforceable. In addition, it may trigger the civil liability of the
directors (i.e. joint and several liability towards third parties and the company itself for a breach of the Belgian Code of
Companies and Associations). In practice, the specific conditions set out in the Belgian Code of Companies and
Associations are quite cumbersome to fulfil. Note that the guarantee limitation language in relation to the Guarantors
incorporated in Belgium, specifically indicates that the guarantee does not extend to any liability to the extent it would
constitute unlawful financial assistance in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Belgian Code of Companies
and Associations.

In Belgium, a transaction entered into by a company must be in its corporate interest, whether such transactions are entered
into for its own benefit or for the benefit of group companies. Corporate interest is not a well-defined term under Belgian
law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal writers. Corporate interest may be held to be present where it can be
shown that (i) the Belgian company itself derives a direct or indirect benefit from the transaction, (ii) the financial risks
that the Belgian company may incur are not be disproportionate to the financial means that are available to it and to the
benefit it derives from the transactions (the ‘proportionality test’) and (iii) the company is a member of a structured group,
with common economic interest. Only the board of directors of the Belgian company can properly assess whether the
conditions are met (and this assessment is a factual matter, which is to be determined on a case-by-case basis). The courts
only exercise a limited ‘marginal review’ whereby they can only determine whether the assessment was reasonable. If a
transaction is entered into contrary to the company’s interest, this can lead to nullity and unenforceability of the transaction.
For an overview on Belgian corporate benefit rules, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the
_Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Belgium—Limitations on Enforcement of the Notes, the_
_Guarantees and Security Interests”._


-----

In light of the proportionality test, the obligations of the Guarantors incorporated in Belgium (and thus the enforcement of
each such Guarantee) is limited to a certain amount to be calculated by reference to the greater of (i) 90% of the Belgian
company’s net assets calculated on the basis of the latest available financial statements at time of entry into the Guarantee,
(ii) 90% of the Belgian company’s net assets calculated on the basis of the latest available financial statements at time of
enforcement on the Guarantee and (iii) the highest amount of on-lending to the Belgian company and its subsidiaries
between the date of entry into the Guarantee and the enforcement of the Guarantee. This guarantee limitation is a combined
guarantee limitation, which applies on a pro rata basis to the guarantee provided by the Guarantors incorporated in Belgium
under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Notes and the Existing Senior Notes. For an overview on guarantee limitation
language, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations—Belgium—Limitations on Enforcement of the Notes, the Guarantees and Security Interests”. In addition,_
each of the Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable
laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor's
or security provider's corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant
Guarantor or security provider, or such Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin
capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or
security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In particular, enforcement of any
such Guarantee or Collateral against the relevant Guarantor or security provider would be subject to certain contractual
limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the Indenture (or any other document governing the Guarantees)
and Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant
Guarantor or security provider. As a result, a Guarantor's or security provider's liability under its Guarantee or Collateral
could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to
it. This could lead to a situation in which such Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a
Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the
case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the
Guarantor's Guarantee or the security provider's Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may
determine that the Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant
Guarantees or Collateral apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable
Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Guarantees and
Collateral may be subject to similar limitations.

It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in
the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor's guarantee
on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee should be limited or voided.
To the extent that agreed limitations on the Guarantee obligation apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively
subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor. Future guarantees
may be subject to similar limitations. Moreover, an increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Guarantee
without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Guarantee will dilute the value of such Guarantee to its beneficiaries,
including the holders of the Notes. See _“Description of the Notes—The Guarantees,” “and “Limitations on Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations,”_

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Guarantees have not been, or will not be, and are not required to be, registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in the United States except
to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other
applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in
the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries comply with applicable
securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.”


-----

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream.

Interests in the global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive
registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-
entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear
and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest
and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Notes will be made to the paying agent,
which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants'
accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to
indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer will have no
responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if
investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through
which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the
Issuer's solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor
owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from
Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable
such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive registered Notes are
issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through
Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to
ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

      - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

      - your ability to sell your Notes; or

      - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates,
our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely
affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade
securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the
Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes, regardless of our prospects and
financial performance. The initial purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing
the Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market-making activities at any time without
notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and other
applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there may not be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading
market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all. If the Additional Notes are issued with
OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Additional Notes will trade separately under different ISIN and common
codes than the relevant Original Note. If the Additional Notes are issued under a different ISIN and common codes than
the Original Notes, the Additional Notes may be less liquid than the Original Notes.


-----

**_The Additional Notes may not become or remain listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

Although an application will be made for the Additional Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange and admitted
to trading thereon, we cannot assure you that the Additional Notes will become or remain listed. Although no assurance is
made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Exchange, failure to be approved for
listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes, as
applicable, from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as
applicable, in the secondary market.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the_**
**_Notes and the related guarantees will be released automatically without your consent or the Trustee or the Security_**
**_Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes or applicable Guarantees will be released automatically,
including a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral or capital stock of such Guarantor in a transaction that does
not violate the asset sale covenant of the Indenture, and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture also permits us to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are Guarantors
as unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of
the liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any guarantees of the Notes by such subsidiary will be released
under the Indenture, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the
aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary
or of its subsidiaries. See “Description of the Notes—The Guarantees—Guarantees Release,” and “Description of the
_Notes—Security—Release of Liens,”_

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment-grade ratings._**

The Indenture provides that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes issued under the Indenture receive
an investment-grade rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s, and BBB- or better by S&P or a rating of BBB or better by Fitch,
and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time
as the Notes are no longer rated investment grade by either ratings agency, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to
the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment
_Grade Status”. At any time when these covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur additional_
indebtedness, pay cash dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of which may conflict
with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment-grade
rating or that any such rating if achieved will be maintained.

**_If the Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable security._**

In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption” and
depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor who receives proceeds due to such an early redemption
may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that carried by
the Notes.

**_The proposed financial transactions tax (FTT) may apply and impact dealings in the Notes._**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a Directive
for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia
(together, except for Estonia, the “Participating Member States”) and which, if enacted and implemented by France,
should replace the French FTT. Following the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (the “ECOFIN”) meeting of
December 8, 2015, Estonia officially announced its withdrawal from the negotiations and, on March 16, 2016, completed
the formalities required to leave the enhanced cooperation on FTT.

The Commission’s Proposal has a very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes
(including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.


-----

At the ECOFIN meeting of June 14, 2019, a state of play of the work on the FTT was presented on the basis of a note
prepared by Germany on June 7, 2019 indicating a consensus among the Participating Member States to continue
negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on the French financial transactions tax model which in
principle would only concern shares of listed companies whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union.
However, such proposal is still subject to change until a final approval.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States, the scope of such tax being
therefore uncertain. The timing of its implementation remains also unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to
participate and Participating Member States may decide to withdraw.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**_Holders of the Additional Notes may be subject to tax on any original issue discount before receiving the cash payments_**
**_attributable to such income._**

The Additional Notes may be issued with original issue discount ("OID") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such
event, U.S. Holders (as defined herein) generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income)
on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. Holders generally will include any OID in income in advance of the cash attributable
to such income.

In addition, if the Additional Notes are issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Additional Notes will
trade separately under a different ISIN numbers and common codes than the corresponding Original Notes.

See “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” for more information.


-----

**Use of Proceeds**

Assuming an issuance at par, we estimate that the gross proceeds from the sale of the Additional Notes will be €350.0
million. The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds are shown in the table below. Actual amounts will vary from
estimated amounts depending on several factors.

**Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations**

_The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended_
_December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021. The following should be read in_
_conjunction with the information set forth under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”, “Summary_
_Consolidated Financial and Other Information”, and the consolidated financial statements of the Group and the notes_
_thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

The following discussion includes forward-looking statements based on assumptions about our future performance. Our
actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors,
including but not limited to those described under “Forward-Looking Statements”, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this
offering memorandum.

**Overview**

We are a leading routine diagnostics company in Europe and we believe we are the leading private medical laboratory
services company by market share in France and Belgium, providing medical laboratory testing services through a large
and dense network of 1,605 collection sites across seven regions in France, one region in Belgium and in six other regions
abroad (including the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Brazil) of the date of this offering
memorandum. We focus mainly on routine lab testing which is conducted exclusively in-house and also offer specialized
tests which can be performed in-house or outsourced to our outsourcing partners. Our in-house testing generally comprises
approximately 98% of our test volume. We outsource only a small portion of specialized tests with low demand (thereby
less profitable to invest in resources to conduct the tests in-house). In France, our customers are mainly patients, whereas
our Belgian customers are generally both doctors and patients. Our local technical platforms also assist nearby clinics with
their medical testing demands.

We perform a range of over 372 medical lab tests with varying degrees of automation, complexity and volume (including
clinical biochemistry, molecular diagnostics, infertility diagnosis, tumor marker testing, microbiology, cytology and
pathology, allergy tests and genetic tests) for patients who have either generally been prescribed these tests by their doctors
or who elect to get tested for certain non-prescribed medical tests.

We have grown our market presence in France, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg through acquisitions of technical
platforms and large networks of nearby collection sites in regions with attractive demographic factors (such as high density
populations, aging populations and affluence), followed by smaller bolt-on acquisitions to create density around technical
platforms and ensure maximization of operating efficiency. Through 57 acquisitions since 2015, we have demonstrated
our ability to consistently deliver on forecast synergies and cost savings, and extract high levels of profitability. Our founder
and shareholder Dr. Stéphane Eimer’s strategic vision and successful track record of consolidation, expertise, industry
knowledge and network, further assisted by our investors and competent management at local laboratory levels, historically
have been an important differentiator during these acquisitions, and our culture as a scientifically-led organization (driven
by ownership by a medical biologist instead of a financial sponsor) uniquely sets us apart from our competitors.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our net sales were €2,107.5 million and our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
(excluding COVID-19 impact) was €468.7 million. See “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other
_Financial and Operating Data.”_

**Factors that affect our Results of Operations**

You should consider the following factors when analyzing our financial condition and results of operations.

**_General Economic Conditions_**

We are exposed to the general economic conditions in our main markets of France, Belgium, Spain, and Luxembourg.
Although the medical laboratory services market is generally considered to be less sensitive to economic cycles than certain


-----

other markets, a prolonged downturn in general economic conditions may negatively affect our results of operations as
governments seek to reduce healthcare expenditure. Moreover, to the extent patients are responsible for all or part of the
costs of laboratory tests, individual decisions to reduce out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures may result in weaker demand
for our services.

**_Regulated Prices for Laboratory Testing_**

We operate predominantly in France, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg and where clinical laboratory testing services are
largely paid for through government-funded healthcare programs with regulated prices. The prices are set by regulators in
France (CNAM), Luxembourg (government and Caisse Nationale de Santé) and Belgium (RIZIV/INAMI), respectively.
Generally, most of our net sales are generated from prescribed tests subject to regulated prices, and a very limited share of
our net sales are generated from non-prescribed tests for which we have discretion to set prices payable by the patients.

We have limited, or no, influence over the levels at which such regulated prices are set. Due to pressure on the healthcare
budget, the regulators in France and Belgium have historically reduced test prices to counterbalance growth in test volumes,
in particular for high-volume tests. The government-regulated test prices are established based on a pre-designated formula.
See “Industry” for more information. Overall price decreases, or pricing formulas that fail to keep up with testing costs,
may reduce our margins and negatively affect our net sales, our operating results or the economic feasibility of providing
certain testing services by some or all of our collection sites and technical platforms.

European governments, including the governments of France and Belgium, have implemented austerity measures aimed at
reducing government spending, including in healthcare. Prices for medical lab tests we perform are fixed under agreements
with CNAM in France and RIZIV/INAMI in Belgium. In France, CNAM entered into the Current Triennial Plan in March
2020, under which the annual budget growth for medical lab tests is set for three years, and allows an increase of up to
0.40% in 2020, 0.50% in 2021 and 0.60% in 2022, excluding COVID-19 related tests. In Belgium, the healthcare reform
measures enacted in 2005 have reduced the prices for medical lab tests significantly, and since 2010 prices in the private
medical laboratory testing market have increased by approximately 1% per annum, with national social welfare agency
contribution roughly tracking inflation and patient contribution levels remaining stable. See “Industry” for more
information. The agreements with the regulators make our net sales easily predictable. Although these agreements create
significant pricing pressure, they also protect us from adverse impact on pricing due to certain unforeseen external shocks,
with the respective governments providing an additional budget for the increased need for tests during exceptional events,
such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, government budget deficits caused by COVID-19 spending could place extra
pressure on medical lab testing related budgets in France, Belgium or any other markets in which we operate or may operate
in the future, which could place further pressure on testing prices and reduce the level of reimbursement by government
entities. This could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. See also “Industry” and
_“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry—The prices we may charge in our markets are dependent on prices set by_
_governments. Efforts to reduce government spending on healthcare and diagnostic testing may adversely affect our_
_business.”_

**_Demand for Laboratory Tests_**

The volume of tests we perform has a direct impact on our net sales. Demographic trends, including an aging population
and population growth, an increasing prevalence of minor illnesses and conditions (such as allergies and certain respiratory
conditions) and chronic, long-term and lifestyle related diseases (such as cancer and diabetes), often require recurrent
testing. In addition, such trends also require an increase in the number of medical consultations per person and number of
tests per consultation, all of which contribute to the increased demand for our services. Testing volumes have also increased
over time as the medical profession has shifted its focus towards the prevention and early detection, diagnosis and treatment
of chronic and severe illnesses and has increasingly relied on medical testing for more accurate diagnoses. This shift has
been supported by increasing demand for bespoke healthcare solutions and the potential for preventive medicine to reduce
future treatment costs. Furthermore, the greater health consciousness of the general public, increased disposable income
and lifestyle trends such as low levels of physical activity, poor nutrition and stress, have contributed and are expected to
continue to contribute to both volume growth and a willingness of certain patients to absorb out-of-pocket costs for non-
prescription preventive medical tests. In France, this increase in demand is also driven by population growth (approximately
0.3 % per annum from 2014 to 2021) and an increase in the number of tests per consultation (3% to 3.5% per annum from


-----

2014 to 2019) resulting from an aging population with a higher rate of chronic diseases and a higher number of available
tests being prescribed by doctors. As a result of COVID-19, test volumes increased by 39% compared to 2019. The industry
has experienced this increase despite the decrease in the number of medical consultations per inhabitant (1.2% per annum
from 2014 to 2019) due to an aging population of physicians, who are retiring faster than new physicians are entering into
practice, as well as a growing trend in self-medication.

The COVID-19 pandemic has driven significant demand for PCR tests and serology tests. As of June 30, 2021, our cost of
reimbursement per PCR test in France was €44.06 and our pro forma cost of reimbursement per PCR test in Belgium was
€40.44. As of September 30, 2021, we have performed more than 18.7 million PCR tests and 1.1 million serology tests for
COVID-19 in France, and as of the end of December 2020, we had performed approximately 6.6 million PCR tests and
0.7 million serology tests in Belgium. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, we generated €584.3 million of net sales
from COVID-19-related PCR and serology tests, accounting for 49.7% of the Group’s net sales for the same period.

While the French, Belgian and Luxembourg governments have reimbursed the testing services provider the costs of PCR
tests in full in the past, their reimbursement policies have since been updated to require certain conditions to be met to
qualify for full reimbursement, and their reimbursement policies may further change from time to time. For example, as of
December 15, 2020, PCR testing services providers in France were reimbursed by the government at €73.59 in total if the
test results are provided within 12 hours from testing. As of October 15, 2021 PCR tests in France are notably reimbursed
for vaccinated people or people with prescriptions at €43.89 per test and at €50.64 per test if results are provided within 12
hours. Moreover, as of October 15, 2021, the French government decided to stop reimbursing PCR testing and so-called
“comfort” antigen tests for anyone who was unvaccinated subject to certain limited exceptions. The price for antigenic
tests is fixed at €22 per test (when performed by a medical biology laboratory). In Belgium if conditions for reimbursement
by the government (including a prescription) are met, the price per PCR test that the lab receives varies between €44.04
and €47.18 per test (depending on the reasons to perform the test). Between June and September, there was a temporary
extra fee of €10 for the collection by medical staff, but that ended on 30 September 2021. The timing and the extent, if any,
of any further changes in policies on reimbursement of COVID-19 tests and government policies in connection with
requiring proof of a negative test or vaccination to carry on certain activities remain uncertain. Due to the increase in
demand for PCR tests, we have experienced a temporary increase in costs due to increase in temporary hiring, among
others. See “Business—Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic” for more information.

**_Expansion of Our Laboratory Network through Acquisitions_**

In the past several years, our growth and expansion have accelerated through acquisitions. We have expanded our
laboratory network mainly through strategic and bolt-on acquisitions, and intend to continue expanding our network in line
with this strategy. Historically, when we enter a new market we have focused on making strategic acquisitions of strong
technical platforms, followed by further bolt-on acquisitions of collection sites with the aim of building a dense network
of sites around each technical platform to generate synergies and maximize operational efficiencies. For example, in
October 2020, we acquired eight companies of the Medina Group, a leading laboratory operator in Belgium, thus expanding
our operations to the Belgian medical lab testing market. Furthermore, in 2021 we acquired Mayo Bio, Labo Sambourg,
Biocéliande, Oriade-Noviale, Alphabio, Bio-Santis, Biosites, Viollet Belmont, Cerba Internacional, Analiza, LLR
Luxembourg and Medilys, and were in the process of acquiring a controlling interest in LLR Belgique at the date of this
Offering Memorandum. Acquisitions in the regions in which we are already present are primarily small- and mid-sized
bolt-on acquisitions that we integrate into our existing network infrastructure and new geographies with Spain and
Luxembourg. We achieve synergies and cost savings in part due to our systematic approach of promptly integrating targets
into our centralized framework agreements, the majority of which we are able to achieve between the first day of integration
and within a few weeks thereafter. For example, our acquisitions of Bioesterel in December 2018 and Biolittoral in June
2019 both resulted in EBITDA margin increases which exceeded our initial target margin. For a timetable of the principal
acquisition activity undertaken by our Group since January 1, 2018 through the date of this offering memorandum, see
_“Business—Our History” and notes 2.1 and 5.1 to our Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering_
memorandum. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, we
completed eleven, sixteen, nine and 11 acquisitions, respectively, for aggregate consideration.

Our acquisitions have resulted in increased net sales, EBITDA and EBITDA margin, with historical acquisitions exceeding
our initial target EBITDA margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of scale in enhancing our financial performance. Due


-----

to the number of acquisitions that we have undertaken and intend to continue to undertake, our results of operations from
period to period may not be comparable.

Acquisitions affect our results of operations in several ways. First, our results for the period during which an acquisition
takes place are affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired business in our consolidated results. Acquired
businesses are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, so the full impact of an acquisition is only reflected in our
financial statements in the subsequent period. In addition, the results of the acquired businesses after the acquisition may
be impacted positively by synergies and cost savings. For example, the businesses we have acquired in the past have
generally generated savings on reagent purchases and personnel expenses, including remuneration of self-employed
biologists who are not on our payroll, mostly at the closing date, and have realized savings on technical and administrative
expenses over a longer period of time.

Because of the nature of the businesses we acquire, we carry a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet
(€3,288.9 million as of June 30, 2021). Goodwill is subject to an impairment test both on an annual basis and whenever
there are indications of impairment, such as a decrease in net sales or EBITDA. We may record significant charges in our
income statement as a result of impairment of goodwill under French GAAP.

In France, we have experienced payment delays from the French social health insurance system and private health insurance
following mergers between Group entities, which have negatively affected our cash flow from operating activities. We are
reimbursed only upon the transmission of patient files to the national health insurance. After a merger, we are required to
re-register biologists under the newly formed entity, which causes delays in the transmission of files and consequently in
reimbursement. In the event of such delays due to mergers that take place close to year end, certain cash flows from
operating activities may not be realized during the relevant period.

We intend to further expand our network by continuing to acquire collection sites and technical platforms in France and
Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg, and selectively explore opportunities to purchase existing laboratory networks in new
markets.

**_Synergies and Cost Savings Initiatives_**

Synergies and cost savings are key components of our historically strong profitability because they provide us with
increased test volume and allow us to compensate for the price pressure from government payers while continuing to grow
our business. Our synergies and cost savings are mainly realized from (i) contractual savings, such as a decrease in the
salaries of the target's biologists, who are otherwise incentivized by becoming shareholders after the acquisition, (ii)
replacement of supplier contracts at the target with our master agreements (or, where possible, renegotiating contracts to
align prices with ours) so as to achieve economies of scale through lower prices and (iii) centralization of testing in one
regional technical platform, enabling us to streamline the overall number of employees or replace a biologist with a lower-
cost technician. In certain cases, our synergies initiatives may lead to certain limited one-off costs.

**_Changes in Regulation_**

The medical diagnostics industry (including medical laboratory testing) is subject to extensive regulations and controls by
various regulatory authorities in our markets. See “Regulation”. These regulations mainly pertain to professional
qualifications of laboratory personnel, ownership and corporate governance constraints on companies operating medical
laboratories, as well as pricing and reimbursement levels for medical tests. Changes made to laws and regulations in the
past have had, and in the future may continue to have, a significant impact on our results of operations. In particular,
compliance with current or future laws and regulations may result in an increase in our administrative, legal or operational
expenditures and may require changes in our commercial practice or company structure.

We are also subject to stringent regulations and strict accreditation procedures in our markets, governing the granting or
the renewal of a license to operate a laboratory and the standards by which any such laboratory is operated. We collaborate
closely with our regulators to stay up–to-date with the latest developments in the relevant regulations in France and
Belgium, particularly with respect to obtaining accreditation under the new accreditation requirement pursuant to the more
rigorous ISO 15189 standard. As of October 31, 2021, Biogroup’s laboratories and facilities in France were 100%


-----

accredited by COFRAC under the ISO 15189 standard. Compliance with current or future laws and regulations may (i)
cause an increase in our administrative, legal and operational expenditure, (ii) force us to alter our commercial practices,
our legal organization, the ownership structure or corporate governance of our subsidiaries or, more generally, (iii) reduce
or limit our net sales. See “Business—Quality Standards” and “Regulation”, and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Industry – We operate in a highly regulated sector. Compliance with regulations applicable to our activities may increase_
_our costs or restrict our activities. Failure to comply with such regulations may lead to penalties of various types. Future_
_alterations to regulations applicable to us may have a material adverse impact on our activities”._

**_Organic Growth_**

Our results of operations are also affected by organic growth in our businesses. Organic growth is a non-French GAAP
measure. Organic growth is determined as follows:

      - in respect of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we have excluded the impact of
acquisitions on revenue by assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2020;

      - in respect of revenue for 2020 (compared with 2019), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions on revenue by
assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2019;

      - in respect of revenue for 2019 (compared with 2018), we have excluded the impact of acquisitions on revenue by
assuming that no acquisitions have occurred after January 1, 2018.

Even pre-COVID-19, from 2018 to 2019, we generated organic net sales growth of 2% in France and 3-4% in Belgium
from 2010 to 2019, exceeding that of the overall market (approximately 0.8% from 2014 to 2019 in France and 2-3% from
2010 to 2018 in Belgium) due in part to our structural exposure to regions exhibiting greater organic growth in testing
volumes. Our historical organic growth in Ile-de-France, the largest market in France, was 2.8% from 2016 to 2019, which
was well above the market average of 1.1% from 2014 to 2019.

**_Sensitivity of Our Cost Structure_**

Our cost base is largely fixed. Only a few regular expenses, namely consumption of materials and supplies (consisting
mainly of reagent purchases) and costs for outsourced tests, certain external expenses and a small portion of personnel
expenses are fully variable. Personnel expenses are also largely fixed, in part due labor laws in our markets limiting
workforce reductions and requiring in France the presence of at least one medical biologist in every lab.

In the context of an acquisition, we believe that our ability to manage staff costs (mainly through reduction in biologists
remuneration secured by closing, and reduction and re-deployment of staff to fully leverage our “hub-and-spoke” model)
and other operating costs of target labs to quickly deliver operating synergies and cost savings minimizes our exposure to
any variability in costs.

We experience limited seasonality in the volumes of tests we perform and, consequently, in our net sales. We have
historically performed fewer tests during holiday and vacation periods, notably in the summer months and around the
winter holidays. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a short-term increase in costs due to an increase in
temporary hiring in 2020 and 2021 in response to the additional demand in PCR testing.

**Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements**

The accounting impacts of the acquisitions are not limited to our consolidated net sales but may also affect the other income
statement line items, including our operating expenses, our depreciation and amortization charges and our cost of debt.

**Key Income Statement Items**

Below is a summary description of the key elements of French GAAP line items of the income statements of the Group.


-----

**_Net sales_**

Net sales correspond to sales of our testing services primarily provided to direct patients and, to a lesser extent, to hospitals
and clinics. Net sales consists of net sales from services rendered in the course of ordinary activities and are recognized
when a report is validated by the medical biologist, which is the date when the results are communicated to the client. For
our direct patients in France, our net sales are derived from the French social healthcare system (Sécurité Sociale),
complementary additional private health insurance plans and, in certain cases, directly from patients, and are based on the
rates set annually by the French government.

**_Cost of materials and supplies_**

Cost of materials and supplies primarily include the costs of reagents and other consumables, net of volume-based rebates
received from suppliers, and associated inventory variations.

**_Personnel expenses_**

Personnel expenses principally include wages, salaries, remuneration of self-employed biologists who are not on our
payroll, compulsory social security contributions, post-employment benefits and other long-term benefits, and employee
profit sharing (as required under French law for our French operations). See “Regulation—France” for more information
on employee profit sharing requirements under French law.

**_Other purchases and external expenses_**

Other purchases and external expenses include mainly consumables (subcontracting costs and staff costs dedicated to
external sample collection (such as costs relating to the collection of test samples by nurses at patients’ homes), operational
leases, maintenance costs, mail and telecommunication expenses, fees to external service providers (audit, accounting,
legal), insurance and travel expenses.

**_Taxes and duties_**

Taxes and duties include certain tax payments, including CVAE payments and payroll tax.

**_Other operating income and expenses_**

Other operating income and expenses principally include miscellaneous income and expenses not related to the operation
of our collection sites and technical platforms, including, among others, operating subsidies and reimbursement to
employees on sick leave.

**_Depreciation and amortization charges net of reversal_**

Depreciation and amortization charges net of reversal include regular depreciation and amortization of noncurrent assets
such as intangible assets, buildings, laboratory equipment, computers and software. When applicable, they also include
impairment of non-current assets and provisions for operational risks, disputes, pensions, bad debt and overdue receivables.

**_Cost of debt_**

Cost of debt include interest and related expenses, such as interest on bank loans, interest on bonds issued to shareholders,
swap-related finance costs and accrued interest and related expenses.

**_Other financial income/(expenses)_**

Other financial income/(expenses) include miscellaneous income and expenses not related to the cost of debt.


-----

**_Net non-recurring income (loss)_**

Net non-recurring income (loss) includes legal reorganization fees, issuance costs of borrowings, gains/losses on dilution
related to mergers, gains/losses on disposal of assets, exceptional increases/reversals and any other non-recurring
income/expenses.

**_Income tax_**

Income tax includes current income tax on taxable profit and deferred tax income and expenses. It does not include other
taxes payable by us, including CVAE, which are recorded under the line item “Taxes and duties” in our French GAAP
income statement.

**Results of Operations**

**_Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 with the Six Months Ended June 30, 2021_**

The following table shows certain line items of the income statement of our audited financial statements for the six months
ended June 30, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021.

**Six months ended June 30,**

**Net income of consolidated companies ............................** **23.7** **279.2**

_Net sales_

Our net sales increased by €820.2 million, or 231.5%, from €354.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, to
€1,174.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to (i) the substantial increase in
demand for PCR tests and serology tests due to COVID-19, (ii) the full-period impact from the 2020 Acquisitions and (iii)
revenues from acquisitions during the first six months of 2021 (Mayo Bio, Labo Sambourg and Biocéliande) (the “2021
**H1 Acquisitions”) The deconsolidation of CBM25 slightly offset the increase in net sales. The acquisitions made during**
the six months ended June 30, 2021 represented consolidated net sales of €21.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2020.

Our net sales generated from PCR and serology tests increased by €332 million from €17 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2020, to €349 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily driven by reduced activity during the
lockdowns in 2020 and the increase in tests performed in 2021.


-----

_Cost of materials and supplies_

The cost of materials and supplies increased by €134.3 million, or 303.2%, from €44.3 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2020, to €178.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to the supply
costs for COVID-19 testing and increased operating expenses related to growth in the business.

As a percentage of net sales, the cost of materials and supplies increased from 12.5% for the six months ended June 30,
2020, to 15.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily driven by the cost of reagents for PCR tests which is
higher than that for other medical tests performed.

_Personnel Expenses_

Personnel expenses increased by €137.3 million, or 103%, from €133.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, to
€270.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the 2020 Acquisitions and the
2021 H1 Acquisitions, as well as additional employees who were hired to help us handle the increase in demand related to
COVID-19.

Personnel expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from 37.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2020, to 23.0%
for the six months ended June 30, 2021. This decrease mainly reflects a greater increase in net sales due to higher testing
volumes for COVID-19 compared to the rise in the number of employees who were hired to meet the additional demand.

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 6,602 FTE employees, which increased to 8,986 FTE employees as of
June 30, 2021, primarily due to acquisitions during the respective periods.

_Other purchases and external expenses_

Other purchases and external expenses increased by €123.4 million, or 183.6%, from €67.2 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2020, to €190.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the full
period impact from the 2020 Acquisitions and the increase in expenses from the 2021 H1 Acquisitions.

As a percentage of net sales, other purchases and external expenses decreased from 19.0% for the six months ended June
30, 2020 to 16.2% for six months ended June 30, 2021, as further set forth in the table below:

**Six months ended June 30,**

**2020** **2021**

**(€ in millions)**

Leases ............................................................................... (19.8) (28.4)

Mail and telecommunication costs ................................... (7.3) (13.5)

Repairs and maintenance costs ......................................... (7.2) (17.2)

Travel and entertainment expenses ................................... (5.0) (13.3)

Energy and furniture ......................................................... (10.0) (21.2)

Subcontracted Technical Analysis .................................... (7.8) (33.4)

Fees................................................................................... (2.6) (16.7)

Others ............................................................................... (7.4) (46.9)

Other purchases and external expenses ............................ **(67.2)** **(190.6)**

_Taxes and duties_

Taxes and duties increased by €13.4 million, or 95.7%, from € 14.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to
€27.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the 2020 Acquisitions and 2021


-----

H1 Acquisitions. As a proportion of net sales, taxes and duties decreased from 4.0% to 2.3% of net sales between 2020 and
2021.

_Other operating income and expenses_

Other operating income and expenses increased by €40.3 million from €4.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020
to €44.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to a change in the French GAAP
principles in application of the French GAAP ANC 2020.01 which replaced the CRC 99.02.

_Depreciation and amortization charges net of reversal_

Depreciation and amortization charges net of reversal increased by €10.3 million, or 75.2%, from €13.7 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2020, to €24.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to
the additional depreciation and amortization of fixed assets charges incurred as a result of the 2020 Acquisitions and 2021
H1 Acquisitions.

_Operating income_

Due to the changes in the line items discussed above, our operating income increased by €441.7 million from €86.4 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2020, to €528.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

_Cost of debt_

Cost of debt increased by €20.2 million, or 66.9%, from €30.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, to €50.4
million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the issuance of new debt in 2020,
mainly in the second half of the year. In February 2021, the Group successfully refinanced its previously existing debt.

_Other financial income_

Other financial income increased by €1.1 million from €0.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, to €1.2 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

_Net financial income/(loss)_

Net financial loss increased by €10.0 million, or 25.4%, from €(39.4) million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, to
€(49.4) million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Within net financial loss, cost of debt increased by €20.3 million,
or 66.9%, from €30.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, to €50.4 million for the six months ended June 30,
2021. This increase was primarily due to the issuance of new debt in the second half of 2020.

_Operating income before tax_

Due to the changes in the line items discussed above, operating income before tax increased by €431.7 million, or 918.5%,
from €47.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, to €478.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

Net non-recurring loss increased by €67.1 million from €(3.6) million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, to €(70.7)
million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Net non-recurring losses during the periods mainly comprise legal
reorganization fees related to debt refinancing undertaken in February 2021, partially offset by the net gains on the disposals
of assets (including Sèvre Biologie and seven sites of Unilians Biogroup (formerly known as Dyomedea-Neolab)) due to
antitrust reasons.

Income taxes increased by €109.1 million, or 553.8%, from €19.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, to €128.8
million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to a strong increase in consolidated profit
before tax.

_Net sales_

Our net sales increased by €679.2 million, or 111.7%, from €608.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to
€1,287.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily the result of (i) the substantial increase
in demand for PCR tests and serology tests due to COVID-19 (with revenue from PCR tests and serology tests contributing
approximately €478 million of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the remainder coming from routine
testing net sales) and (ii) 2020 Acquisitions (primarily the Medina Acquisition, the full year impact of the Laborizon


-----

Acquisition and Unilians Biogroup Acquisition) and the full-period impact of the acquisitions in 2019. The 2020
Acquisitions represent consolidated net sales of €304.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Excluding the effects of our mergers and acquisitions, our net sales from organic growth increased by €463 million, or
76.1%, from 608.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €1,071.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2020, primarily driven by the increase in testing volumes for PCR tests due to the increased demand in connection with
the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our net sales generated from PCR and serology tests for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €478 million.

_Cost of materials and supplies_

Cost of materials and supplies increased by € 154.5 million, or 237.7%, from €65.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2019, to €219.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions we
completed during 2020. It was also driven by the rise in testing volume for PCR tests due to the increased demand in
connection with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as the cost of reagents for PCR tests are higher than the average cost of
reagents for other medical tests that we perform.

As a percentage of net sales, cost of materials and supplies increased from 10.7% for the years ended December 31, 2019,
to 17.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 negatively impacted by the PCR cost of reagents.

_Personnel Expenses_

Personnel expenses increased by €135.0 million, or 58.3% from €231.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to
€366.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions we completed
during 2020 and additional full-time equivalent (“FTE”) employees whom we hired to help us handle the increase in
COVID-19 testing. We also granted COVID-19 pandemic-related bonuses during the year ended December 31, 2020 which
further contributed to the relative increase.

Personnel expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from 38.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 28.5% for
the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease reflects a larger increase in net sales from the increase in COVID-19
testing volume relative to the additional FTE employees hired to meet the rise in demand during the year ended December
31, 2020.

As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 5,190 FTE employees, which increased to 6,602 FTE employees as of
December 31, 2020, primarily due to acquisitions during the respective periods and the surge in testing demand caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Other purchases and external expenses_

Other purchases and external expenses increased by €63.0 million, or 54.6%, from €115.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, to €178.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the
acquisitions we completed during the year ended December 31, 2020.

As a percentage of net sales, other purchases and external expenses decreased from 18.9% for the year ended December
31, 2019 to 13.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as further set forth in the table below:

million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions we completed during
2020. As a proportion of net sales, taxes and duties decreased from 4.0% to 3.2% of net sales between 2019 and 2020.

_Other operating income and expenses_

Other operating income and expenses decreased by €0.7 million, or 350%, from a net expense of €0.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to a net expense of €0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Depreciation and amortization charges net of reversal_

year ended December 31, 2019, to €24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due
to the additional depreciation and amortization charges on fixed assets incurred by the laboratory companies we acquired
during 2020.

_Operating income_

Due to the changes in the line items discussed above, our operating income increased by €298.3 million, or 188.8%, from

_Cost of debt_

Cost of debt increased by €26.3 million, or 37.6%, from €70.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €96.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the financing of the acquisitions we
completed during 2020. This increase was primarily due to additional drawings under the term loan facilities (which were
refinanced at the date of issuance of the Existing Senior Secured Notes), drawings under the Refinanced Second Lien Debt,
and issuance of convertible bonds, the proceeds of which were used to finance our acquisitions during the respective
periods.

_Other financial income and expenses_

Other financial income and expenses decreased by €1.2 million, or 150%, from €0.8 million for the year ended December
31, 2019, to €(0.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Net financial income/(loss)_

Net financial loss increased by €27.5 million, or 39.7%, from €69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €96.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Within net financial loss, cost of debt increased by €26.3 million, or 37.6%,
from €70.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €96.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This

31, 2019, to a loss of €(266.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease mainly stems from a €230.7
million non-cash expense which corresponds to the difference between the issuance price and the repurchase price
associated with Laboratoire Eimer share buyback conducted in 2020.

_Income taxes_

Income taxes increased by €74.0 million, or 215.1%, from €34.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €108.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the higher net sales resulting from the
2020 Acquisitions and increased COVID-19 related sales.

Income tax included current tax expense and deferred tax expense as set forth below for the respective periods:

**Year ended December 31,**

**2019** **2020**

Our net sales increased by €259.2 million, or 74.3%, from €348.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to €608.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions we completed during
2018 and 2019. In 2018 and 2019, respectively, we completed 11 and 16 acquisitions in Corsica, Grand Est, PACA, Ile-
de-France and AURA.

Excluding the effects of our mergers and acquisitions, our net sales from organic growth increased by €4.6 million, or
2.0%, from €233.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to €237.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
primarily due to the increase in net sales resulting from our presence in dynamic regions, including PACA, Ile-de-France,
Grand Est and AURA, as well as from our Biolam LCD operations, which benefit from their location in metropolitan areas.
The acquisitions made during 2018 and 2019 represent consolidated net sales of €371.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019.

_Cost of materials and supplies_

completed during 2018 and 2019. As a percentage of net sales, cost of materials and supplies decreased from 11.5% for
the year ended December 31, 2018, to 10.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting improved purchase
conditions due to our growing market share, which allowed us to renegotiate the purchase price of reagents.

_Personnel Expenses_

Personnel expenses increased by €98.0 million, or 73.4%, from €133.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to
€231.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions we completed

Personnel expenses as a percentage of net sales slightly decreased from 38.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018, to
38.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily due to better absorption of fixed costs from growth
in scale and realized synergies.

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 3,961 FTE employees, which increased to 5,620 FTE employees for the
year ended December 31, 2019, which were primarily due to acquisitions during the respective periods.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business
operations, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and
other commitments, as well as acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operating activities and our
financings. Our liquidity requirements arise primarily to fund acquisitions, to meet our debt service obligations, and, to a
lesser extent, to fund capital expenditures and to utilize as working capital.

Our financial condition and liquidity are and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors, including:

      - our ability to generate cash flows from our operations;

      - the level of our outstanding indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, and the interest we are obligated
to pay on such indebtedness, which affects our net financial expense;

      - our ability to continue to borrow funds from financial institutions; and

      - our external growth funding requirements, which consist primarily of the funding of acquisitions of additional
laboratories.

Our cash requirements consist mainly of the following:

      - funding acquisitions;

      - servicing our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries;

      - funding capital expenditure needs;

      - operating activities; and

      - paying taxes.

Our sources of liquidity consist mainly of the following:

      - cash generated from our operating activities;

      - net proceeds from our outstanding debt securities, including bonds redeemable in preference shares, bonds
convertible in shares and the Notes;

      - borrowings under our loan facilities; and

      - capital contributions from our shareholders.

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operating activities, together with available borrowings under the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, we cannot
assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities or that future debt financing will
be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other
liquidity needs.

**Consolidated Cash Flow Statement**

The following table summarizes Group's consolidated cash flow statement for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019,

compared with a cash inflow of €372.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Improved cash flows from operating
activities during the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared with the same period in 2020 were primarily due to the
2021 H1 Acquisitions and further COVID-19 related income increases.

Net cash flow from operating activities represented a cash inflow of €127.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
compared with a cash inflow of €311.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash flows from operating activities
during the periods were primarily due to the acquisitions we completed during 2019 and 2020. Cash flows from operating
activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 also accounts for the increased PCR testing volume due to the COVID-19
pandemic, despite a negative impact of change in working capital. See “—Working Capital” below for more information.

Excluding the effects of our mergers and acquisitions, our net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended
December 31, 2020 increased compared to 2019 due to a decrease in non-recurring cash outflows related to one-off costs
related to the reorganization of our capital structure, which we incurred during 2019. Operating activities for the year ended
December 31, 2020 were negatively affected by changes in working capital due to an increase in trade receivables and
payment delays from the French social health insurance system and private health insurance subsequent to mergers between
certain Group entities (notably CAB with Analyseo, and BPO-Bioépine with BPO), resulting from the requirement to re-
register biologists under the newly formed entity, which causes delays in reimbursement. See “Factors that affect our
_Results of Operations—Expansion of Our Laboratory Network through Acquisitions” above._

Net cash flow from operating activities represented a cash inflow of €16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
compared with a cash inflow of €127.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash flows from operating activities
during the periods were primarily due to the acquisitions we completed during 2018 and 2019. Excluding the effects of our
mergers and acquisitions, our net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased
compared to 2018 due to a decrease in non-recurring cash outflows related to one-off costs related to the reorganization of
our capital structure, which we incurred during 2018. Operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were
negatively affected by changes in working capital due to an increase in trade receivables and payment delays from the
French social health insurance system and private health insurance subsequent to mergers between certain Group entities
(notably CAB with Analyseo, and BPO-Bioépine with BPO), resulting from the requirement to re-register biologists under
the newly formed entity, which causes delays in reimbursement. See “Factors that affect our Results of Operations—
_Expansion of Our Laboratory Network through Acquisitions” above._

**_Net cash flow from Investing Activities_**

Net cash flow from investing activities represented a cash outflow of €1,482.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2020, compared with a cash outflow of €46.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Cash flows from investing
activities year ended December 31, 2020 include acquisitions of subsidiaries and additional equity interests of €1,510.9
million, as well as investments in fixed assets of €33.7 million, which was higher than the preceding period, mainly related
to the purchase of PCR testing equipment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash flows from investing activities
during the six months ended June 30, 2021 include acquisitions of subsidiaries and additional equity interests of €60.1


-----

million, as well as investment in fixed assets of €23.3 million, which was higher than the same period in 2020, mainly
related to the purchase of PCR testing equipment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Net cash flow from investing activities represented a cash outflow of €515.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
compared with a cash outflow of €1,482.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash flows from investing
activities during 2019 include cash expensed to acquire businesses for €380.7 million, net of cash acquired, mainly in
connection with Laborizon Acquisition and Unilians Biogroup Acquisition. Cash flows from investing activities year ended
December 31, 2020 include investment in fixed assets of €33.7 million, which was higher than the preceding period mainly
related to the purchase of PCR testing equipment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Net cash flow from investing activities represented a cash outflow of €629.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
compared with a cash outflow of €515.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding the effects of our
mergers and acquisitions, cash flows from investing activities during the periods were primarily due to the opening of new
technical platforms and purchases of new testing equipment for improved capacity, as well as the opening or refurbishment
of our laboratories.

For more information on our maintenance and growth capital expenditure and acquisition capital expenditure during the
periods under review, see “—Working Capital” below.

**_Net cash flow from Financing Activities_**

Net cash flow from financing activities represented a cash inflow of €1,423.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2020, compared with a cash outflow of €115.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Cash flows from financing
activities during the periods were primarily due to new borrowings of €1,165.8 million in the year ended December 31,
2020 used to finance acquisitions, and new borrowings of €2,504.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 used to
finance acquisitions and refinancings thereof, offset by repayment of borrowings and finance leases of €2,576 million
during the same period, which was undertaken to optimize the cost of debt.

Net cash flow from financing activities represented a cash inflow of €424.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
compared with a cash inflow of €1,423.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash flows from financing
activities during the periods were primarily due to new borrowings of €1,165.8 million in the year ended December 31,
2020 and new borrowings of €544.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.

Net cash flow from financing activities represented a cash inflow of €615.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
compared with a cash inflow of €424.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This change was primarily due to
additional drawings for the financing of acquisitions completed during the period, net of repayments of borrowings and
refinancing. Cash flows from financing activities during the period include the issuance of convertible bonds for an amount
of €80.7 million and of bonds redeemable in preferred shares for an amount of €96.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2019.

**Working Capital**

In line with industry, our working capital is structurally negative due to low inventories and low days sales outstanding
(“DSO”) (typically 15 days, but has been higher recently, at up to 37 days, in August 2021), as our principal payment
counterparties are CNAM and RIZIV/INAMI. For more information on our billing and payment, see “Business—Billing
_and Payment”. Moreover, due to limited seasonality, our working capital generally remains stable over the periods, except_
for fluctuations due to tax and social security-related payments, such as quarterly corporate income tax payments.

Changes in working capital amounted to €(3.9) million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 (which was similar to the
figure for the year ended December 31, 2019), compared to €(54.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2020,
primarily due to an increase of the Group’s perimeter.


-----

**Capital Expenditures**

Capital expenditures consist of additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Our acquisition capital
expenditures are primarily related to goodwill recognized from the acquisitions of collection sites and technical platforms.
Our maintenance and growth capital expenditure primarily relate to refurbishment of collection sites and technical
platforms, acquisition of testing machines and other equipment, furniture, fixtures, fittings and office equipment.

While we do not typically buy testing equipment necessary to conduct our in-house testing operations, we purchased PCR
testing equipment in March 2020 in connection with the increased demand for COVID-19-related tests. See “Business—
_Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic” for more information._

Our net cash capital expenditures, including amounts paid for business capital and goodwill associated with acquisitions,
for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 were €669.4 million,
€542.1 million, €1,543.4 million, and €64.8 million, respectively.

Our net cash capital expenditures, excluding amounts paid for business capital and goodwill associated with acquisitions,
for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 were €14.8 million, €9.9
million, €32.5 million, and €4.7 million, respectively.

**_Pensions and Similar Obligations_**

Our provisions for pensions and similar obligations amounted to €14.1 million as of June 30, 2021. These obligations
include pensions commitments. For a description of our pension obligations, see note 3.17 of the Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Off-Balance Sheet Commitments**

We are a party to various customary off-balance sheet arrangements, which includes pledge receivables and bank accounts.
See note 8 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Financial Risk Management**

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Our primary exposure to market interest rate risk due to the fluctuations in interest rate relates to the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility, as the interest payable thereunder are on a floating basis. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement” and “Capitalization” for more information on the Existing Revolving Credit_
Facility and the Existing Term Loan Facility after giving effect to the Transactions and related terms thereunder. We have
entered, and may in the future, enter into hedging transactions and use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the
adverse effects of this risk from time to time.

**_Credit Risk_**

Our primary exposure to credit risk relates to our trade receivables. Health authorities in France and Belgium are our
principal payment counterparties, which reduces our credit risk. We also believe our credit risk is reduced because neither
our customer base nor our geographical footprint are concentrated. Outstanding receivables from customers are regularly
monitored and collected on when overdue by way of a multi-step collections procedure. While we are limited in our ability
to minimize credit risk of customers prior to transactions due to our public service obligations, we receive a significant
portion of our net sales from business with health insurers who are nationwide partners under statutory health insurance
schemes or public authorities.

**_Foreign Exchange Risk_**

We have not historically been exposed to foreign exchange risk as we conduct our business based on euro in the markets
where we operate. However, any future international acquisition in jurisdictions that do not conduct business in euro may
expose us to the risk of greater exchange rate fluctuations.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

We manage liquidity risk by ongoing monitoring of our cash flows on a regular basis. In order to manage our liquidity
needs, we also have a rolling liquidity plan, which is prepared on a periodic basis or after major acquisitions. In light of
the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have considered a number of downside sensitivities to
our base case budget in 2020 and into 2021, including certain stress test scenarios, and plan to do so for any future
exogenous events that might affect our liquidity.

**Certain differences between French GAAP and IFRS**

Our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Unaudited Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum have been prepared in accordance with French GAAP. Certain differences exist between French
GAAP and IFRS that may be material to the financial information presented therein. As there are significant differences
between French GAAP and IFRS, if we were to prepare our consolidated financial statements based on IFRS instead of
French GAAP, there could be substantial differences in our results of operations, cash flows and financial position,
including levels of indebtedness.


-----

In particular, the estimated IFRS 16 impact on EBITDA and financial debt for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 (as
further described below) is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to be what our EBITDA and
financial debt would have actually been, had we prepared our consolidated financial statements based on IFRS.

The discussion set forth below summarizes certain differences identified between French GAAP as applied by the Group
and IFRS, following a limited analysis of both sets of principles. The Group is responsible for preparing the summary
below and has not prepared a reconciliation of its consolidated financial information from French GAAP to IFRS.

In making an investment decision, investors must rely upon their own examination of the Group, the terms of the Offering
and the financial information. Potential investors should consult their own professional advisors for an understanding of
the differences between French GAAP and IFRS and how those differences might affect the financial information herein.
Potential investors should not take this summary to be a comprehensive list of all differences between French GAAP and
IFRS.

Some differences between French GAAP and IFRS, as they relate to the Group, are listed hereafter.

      - CVAE has been classified as other operating expenses under French GAAP rather than income tax under IFRS.

      - Retirement indemnities would have been treated differently under IFRS than French GAAP, but we do not deem
this difference to be material for the Group.

      - Certain acquisition costs and issuance borrowing costs are capitalized under French GAAP rather than being
expensed as they would be under IFRS.

      - Valuation of financial debt differs from French GAAP under IAS 32 and IFRS 9.

      - Recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities differs from French GAAP under IAS 12.

      - IFRS 16, applicable since January 1, 2019 is a significant difference between French GAAP and IFRS. Application
of IFRS 16 to the Group would:

 increase EBITDA by replacing the operating lease costs by depreciation of right of use and interest on
rents. The impact on EBITDA is estimated to be €81.1 million for the twelve months ended June 30,
2021. This impact is calculated by cancelling the total rent charge plus the estimated embedded leases
(in connection with our technical equipment) contained within our reagent contracts; and

 increase the financial debt as of June 30, 2021 by €292.1 million. This estimation is based on assumptions
taken by the Group, notably with regards to duration and discount rate.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

Preparation of our consolidated financial statements under French GAAP requires us to use judgments, estimates and
assumptions, including expectations of future events, which affect the reported amounts of certain financial statement line
items.

These assessments and estimates are reviewed at each reporting date and the underlying assumptions are adjusted, where
appropriate, based on actual results, experience and any other relevant factors given the economic circumstances. The
effects of such adjustments are recognized when made. The items reported in our future consolidated financial statements
may differ from current estimates due to changes in the assumptions made and economic circumstances at the reporting
date.

The accounting policies and estimates we consider to be the most critical in understanding the assumptions and judgments
that are involved in preparing our financial statements in accordance with French GAAP and in understanding the
uncertainties that could affect our financial results, financial condition and cash flows are presented below.


-----

      - consolidation methods;

      - accounting for goodwill;

      - accounting for pension and similar commitments;

      - accounting for provisions for risks and charges; and

      - accounting for income tax.

A more detailed description of the accounting rules and methods that we apply under French GAAP is provided in note 3
to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements and to the Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum.

_Consolidation Methods_

All significant investments in affiliates that are exclusively controlled by the Group, either directly or indirectly, are fully
consolidated.

French law requires that the medical biologists that operate a laboratory company (SEL or SELAS) hold a majority of the
share capital and voting rights of such laboratory entity. As a result, medical biologists operating our laboratory companies
hold at least 50.01% of their respective voting rights. See “Business—Our Corporate Structure (SEL/SELAS)” for more
information.

However, we typically retain 90% or more of the financial rights of our laboratory companies. We also maintain de facto
control over our subsidiaries' actions through shareholders' agreements, including on major operating decisions such as
acquisitions, incurrence of debt and yearly budgeting. As such, our French entities are fully consolidated.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

_Accounting for goodwill_

Goodwill represents the difference between the acquisition cost of shares in consolidated companies and the share of the
fair value identified at the acquisition date. Goodwill is determined by comparing the acquisition price of the shares to the
share acquired of the following items:

      - shareholders' equity at the end of the period preceding the acquisition (less any dividends distributed during the
period in which the acquisition took place),

      - share of net income at the acquisition date;

      - retirement provisions;

      - deferred tax assets in relation to retirement provisions;

      - deferred tax assets in relation to temporary differences;

      - deferred tax assets in relation to carried-forward tax losses; and

      - amortization of business capital and of net technical loss from mergers.

      - Where necessary, goodwill has also been reduced by the sum of the following two items:


-----

      - any dividends received during the period in which the acquisition took place, as these are taken into account when
determining the price of the acquired shares; and in the event of new goodwill arising following an increase to an
existing holding, the amount of any goodwill, net of amortization, at the end of the previous period.

Intra-group gains on sales of business capital are eliminated.

Insofar as it is not composed of identifiable assets, business capital recognized in the balance sheets of Group companies
can be equated with goodwill. It is therefore adjusted as follows in the consolidated financial statements:

      - disclosure within intangible assets; and

      - impairment test, performed with the same method as goodwill.

Goodwill (and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives) are subject to testing for impairment at least once a year
and whenever there is an indication of impairment. In assessing value in use, we apply a multiple of EBITDA (12 times
EBITDA in 2020, 12 times EBITDA in 2019 and 11 times EBITDA in 2018).

_Accounting for pension and similar commitments_

In accordance with the laws and practices of France, we grant our employees post-employment benefits and other long-
term benefits.

We recognize provisions for all employee benefits calculated in accordance with the retrospective actuarial method. As
such, pension commitments are measured using the projected unit credit method for all employees based on estimated
wages at career-end. We defer the recognition of actuarial gains or losses to the income statement.

_Accounting for provisions for risks and charges_

Provisions for risks and charges cover probable or certain obligations with an uncertain due date or of an uncertain amount,
resulting from litigation, retirement awards and negative goodwill. A provision is recognized whenever the Group has a
contractual, legal or implied obligation arising from a past event and when future cash disbursements can be reliably
estimated.

We examine all litigation in which we have been involved, and, after seeking external advice, provisions are recognized
whenever necessary to cover the estimated risks.

_Accounting for income tax_

Income tax comprises current and deferred taxes. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss unless they
relate to a business combination or to items that are recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

Corporate tax represents tax payable, less any amounts in relation to tax losses carried back, research tax credits and
sponsorship tax credits.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated separately for each Group company and primarily arise from temporary
differences between accounting profit and taxable profit, consolidation adjustments and carried forward tax losses.

We apply the liability method and recognize deferred tax wherever the value of an asset or liability for tax purposes is
different from its value for accounting purposes. The effects of changes in tax rates are recognized in profit or loss for the
period during which the changes is tax laws are enacted.

Deferred tax assets arising from carried-forward tax losses are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that they
will be offset against future profits within a reasonable timeframe. The possibility of recognizing a tax asset in our
consolidated financial statements is thus limited by the recommendations issued in Regulation 99-02 (règlement CRC 99-


-----

_02), as amended January 1, 2017, accounting regulation relating to consolidated accounts of commercial companies and_
public enterprises in France.

The French Finance Act of 2010 eliminated the business tax (taxe professionnelle) as of 2010 and replaced it with two new
taxes: the property business tax (cotisation foncière des entreprises, or the “CFE”) and the value added business tax
(cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des entreprises, or the “CVAE”). Under French GAAP, the CVAE is recognized under
the line taxes and duties of the operating income. See “Tax Considerations—Certain French Tax Consequences” for more
information.

**Industry**

_Certain of the information set forth in this section has been derived from external sources. Industry surveys and_
_publications generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable,_
_but some of this information may have been derived from estimates or subjective judgments or have been subject to limited_
_audit and validation. While we have examined and relied upon certain market or other industry data from external sources_
_as the basis for our estimates, we have not independently verified such data._

**Overview**

We are a leading European player by net sales in the medical diagnostics services industry conducting most of our business
in France, Belgium (following our acquisition of Medina Group in 2020), Luxembourg (since our acquisition of LLR
Luxembourg in 2021) and Spain (following our acquisition of Cerba International and investment in Analiza in 2021). We
are specifically focused on private medical laboratory testing, primarily conducting routine laboratory tests and, to a lesser
extent, specialized laboratory testing.

**Medical Laboratory Testing**

Medical laboratory tests (“MLT”) are medical examinations carried out to obtain information about a patient’s health for
the purpose of aiding in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease. These tests are used to facilitate medical
decisions and increase the efficiency of healthcare systems by providing prompt and accurate diagnoses. This improves the
quality of care for patients and reduces the ultimate cost of medication and/or hospitalization. The healthcare industry’s
focus is increasingly shifting from the treatment of patients’ existing medical conditions to the prevention and early
detection of medical conditions. This shift is leading to greater reliance of diagnostic testing services and, consequently,
increasing demand for medical laboratory testing.

The customer base in the medical laboratory services market is diverse and spans both the public and private sectors.
Customers include individual patients as well as hospitals, public and private clinics, medical practices and laboratories,
physicians, blood collection points, public health agencies, private insurers, pharmaceutical companies and medical
research organizations.

MLT are performed either in public hospitals with in-house labs or in private independent laboratories. Laboratories such
as ours receive business either from patients who choose to have their tests performed by a particular laboratory, or directly
from physicians or clinics who send samples for analysis. In France and Luxembourg, we conduct the majority of our
business using a B2C model where patients choose our private labs after having received a prescription from an independent
doctor or from a hospital / clinic. In Belgium, our business is primarily B2B, as most samples are taken by doctors or
physicians rather than in high-street labs and, consequently, it is the doctors or physicians, not the patient, deciding which
lab will test the samples. In Spain, the healthcare system includes both private and public systems, which operate fairly
independently. In that market, private insurers and private hospitals are the main business contributors to private
laboratories.

Medical laboratory testing can be broadly split between routine laboratory testing and specialized laboratory testing.
Routine laboratory testing includes common diagnostics tests that help medical professionals make informed decisions
when treating a patient. For example, patients can be prescribed routine tests in connection with a diagnosis, monitoring
and treatment of medical conditions such as cancer, infectious diseases, blood disorders or pregnancy, among other uses.
Routine tests are typically of low complexity and based on the analysis of bodily fluids, including blood and urine.
Specialized laboratory testing consists primarily of complex and relatively rare laboratory testing needs that local smaller
laboratories and hospitals are unable to meet due to the specialized technical equipment required to run such tests.

**Market Characteristics**

We operate in the private medical laboratory testing market where, according to the industry report in 2019, in our core
markets of France and Belgium, approximately 90% to 95% of tests by volume are routine tests, while the remaining 5%


-----

to 10% are specialized tests. In our industry, routine testing is highly automated, scale driven, and efficiency-oriented.
According to the Assurance Maladie report, in 2020, the top 15 most frequent tests in France, representing approximately
50% of the private MLT market in volume and approximately 50% of all routine test volumes, were: (1) blood test for cell
count test including platelet, (2) blood test for creatinine, (3) blood test for glucose and glycemia, (4) blood test for
ionograms, (5) blood test for transaminases, (6) blood test for c-reactive protein (“CRP”), (7) blood test for gamma
glutamyl transferase, (8) blood test for lipid abnormality, (9) blood test for thyroid-stimulating hormone (“TSH”), , (10)
test for sedimentation rate, (11) blood test for ferritin, (12) blood test for hemoglobin A1c (“HBA1C”), (13) blood test for
alcalin phosphatase, (14) blood test for uricemia and (15) blood test for calcium.

**France**

In France, doctors typically prescribe MLTs, allowing patients to freely choose the medical laboratory in which the tests
will take place. Patients tend to choose laboratories based on proximity to their home or workplace. Accordingly, the choice
of a high traffic location, reputation for quality of services and quick deliverability of results are key success factors for
medical testing laboratories.

According to the Assurance Maladie 2020 industry report, in 2020, public hospital laboratories (excluding COVID) in
France represented approximately 20% to 25% of MLT market value (excluding COVID). This includes large public
hospitals with in-house labs and their own practitioners, as well as small and mid-sized hospitals that tend to outsource part
of their testing volumes to private labs. Per the industry report, private independent labs, such as Biogroup, represented
approximately 75% to 80% of MLT market value in France in 2020 (excluding COVID) and largely comprise high-street
labs with capable of providing and processing tests for both public and private hospital labs.

**Market size and trends**

France is one of the main markets in Europe for private MLT. As per the industry report, the French MLT market generated
revenues of approximately €7.5 billion to €8.0 billion in 2019. Estimates from the industry report show that the accessible
market for private laboratories amounted to approximately €4.6 billion while the accessible market for public laboratories
reached approximately €2.8 billion to €3.3 billion in France in 2019.

The French private MLT market varies across regions in both supply and demand characteristics due to demographic
disparities regarding aging populations and the number of pregnant women, the two most significant users of medical
laboratory testing services. According to the industry report, Île-de-France is the region that makes up the largest share of
the private MLT market in France, with an estimated total of €0.9 billion in 2018, followed by Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes
with €0.6 billion and PACA with €0.5 billion. These regions benefit from large populations, high laboratory density and
the highest density of practitioners in France.

We believe we are well positioned across the largest and most attractive regions of France. In total, we operate 830
laboratories across seven regions and have a strong presence in Île-de-France, which comprises 23% of our portfolio, while
the Île-de-France, Auvergne Rhône-Alpes and the PACA (representing rapidly growing or aging populations, metropolitan
areas with above-average population density and relative affluence) represent 62% of our laboratories portfolio in total.

The private MLT market is underpinned by a number of secular tailwinds and, as a result, has historically proven to be
resilient. According to the industry report, between 2007 and 2011, which included the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the MLT
market grew by approximately 2% to 3% per year as CNAM, the French social security system, did not reduce its expenses
during the economic downturn due to the importance of healthcare in the French public system from a social and political
perspective. From 2014 to 2020, the French private MLT market continued growing in value, albeit at a reduced pace of
0.3% to 0.4% per year from approximately €4.5 billion in 2014 to approximately €4.6 billion in 2020, excluding COVID
(€6.3 billion including COVID).

Going forward, we believe the French MLT market will continue to grow, driven by a more favorable triennial plan (as
further described below) and steady volume growth supported by strong fundamentals. In general, we do not expect growth
in the private MLT market to outpace the public MLT market as French regulators are committed to maintaining adequate


-----

capacity in the public sphere. Nevertheless, we believe steady demand driven by the medical profession’s growing focus
on preventative care will continue to result in outsourcing from public hospitals to private medical testing providers.

Moreover, in the current COVID-19 context, the medical laboratory testing market has benefitted from an additional
revenue stream outside the budgetary envelope dictated by the Current Triennial Plan. We believe this may continue to
provide additional upside to lab operators in the future.

We are well positioned to benefit from the growth trend due to our economies of scale, our operational excellence and
record of customer satisfaction that will enable us to maintain and improve our established growth trajectory. In particular,
we believe that our cost control policy and operational efficiency allow us to absorb pricing pressure better than many of
our smaller competitors.

**Healthcare system**

Based on the size of the private lab market in the industry report and the proportion of spending in the French private
medical testing market according to “Les dépenses de santé en 2020 —Résultats des comptes de la santé,” a report
published in 2021 by Panorama de La Drees Santé, approximately 79.1% (or €4.9 billion) of spending in the French private
medical testing market was financed by the French social security system and the remainder was covered by private
insurance companies (approximately 17.2%, or €1.07 billion) and by the patient directly out-of-pocket (approximately
2.2%, or €0.138 billion) in 2020.

While this reimbursement structure had been stable for years, the 100% reimbursement of COVID-19 testing by the French
social security system beginning late July 2020 has led to an increase of its share in the financing of MLT spending with
the French social security system covering approximately 79.1% of spending in 2020, according to “Les dépenses de santé
_en 2020 —Résultats des comptes de la santé”._

Given MLT services are largely funded by the French state, French medical laboratory test prices are regulated and dictated
by a three-year renewable agreement between CNAM and medical biologists’ labor unions (“Triennial Plan”) that, due
to pressure on the healthcare budget, aims to limit CNAM MLT expenses by capping the overall budget’s growth rate.
Historically, high testing volume growth above the Triennial Plan’s budget growth cap has led to tightening pricing levels
for tests.

Government-regulated test prices are established based on a B-Key methodology, which derives prices from the sum of
the direct cost of the test, service fees and other applicable extra costs. Test prices are revised at least annually in order to
ensure adherence with the Triennial Plan’s budget constraints.

In practice, to define prices for reimbursable tests, CNAM publishes a quotation grid, which fixes prices for specific tests
through coefficients (the “B-Key Test Coefficient”). A test’s B-Key Test Coefficient is then multiplied by a standard value
applicable to all tests (the “B-Key Value”) to determine the direct cost of the test. The B-Key Value, which can be revised
by CNAM, has remained fixed since 2002 at €0.27, besides two exceptional and temporary decreases. The final price is
then derived by adding additional fees including service fees and other applicable extra costs (e.g. for processing patient
data, collecting information required for the tests, fast-tracking or certifications) to the test’s direct cost. Generally, more
specialized and newer tests are not initially included in the price list and thus not reimbursed. As a result, MLT companies
can set prices freely for these tests.

Since the introduction of the Triennial Plan in 2013, high volume growth has been consistently offset by price reductions.
According to the industry report, over the 2014 to 2019 period, test volumes increased by approximately 2.0% to 2.5% per
year, however, CNAM has contained its MLT expenses to a growth of only 0.25% per year over the same period. As per
the industry report, this resulted in test price reductions of approximately 1.5% over the period, affecting mainly high
volume-tests with prices reduced by approximately 5% per year for the top 15 high volume routine tests between 2016 and
2018.

The Current Triennial Plan for the period between 2020 and 2022 was signed on March 11, 2020 and allows an increase
of up to 0.40% in 2020, 0.50% in 2021 and 0.60% in 2022, excluding COVID-19 related tests. This plan is more favorable


-----

than the previous plan, where budget growth was limited to 0.25% per year over the 2014 to 2019 period. Although the
Triennial Plan creates pricing pressure, it also protects our industry from unforeseen external shocks by providing an
additional budget to meet the increased need for tests during an exceptional event. In this context, COVID-19 tests’ are
considered an exceptional event and are therefore not included in CNAM’s annual capped budget, which for 2020, was
fixed at €3.76 billion. CNAM’s annual capped budget is €3.78 billion for 2021. As routine tests’ volume has decreased
significantly during the lockdown from March to May 2020, the CNAM cancelled the revision of prices in 2020. As the
MLT activity began to recover in France starting in Q4-2020, a 2.5% tariff reduction was applied in France from April
2021.

**Belgium**

According to the industry report, in 2018 the private MLT market in Belgium was primarily B2B, with approximately 80%
of test volumes originating from samples taken by doctors or specialist physicians and subsequently sent to testing facilities.
As a result of this model, medical practitioners are the ones that decide which lab will process the samples. Typically,
doctors work consistently with one lab and have high stickiness, valuing quick turnaround time, service (such as daily
sample pick-up) and user-friendly IT platforms. Laboratories are legally prohibited from incentivizing doctors or specialist
physicians to work with them.

As per the industry report, in 2018, the private MLT market segment accounted for approximately 35% to 40% of the
broader Belgian MLT market by value. This trend has been stable in the past four years, with the remaining approximately
60% to 65% of tests carried out by public hospital labs. The value of the estimated accessible MLT market in Belgium in
2019 was €0.6 billion.

**Market size and trends**

According to the industry report, the Belgian MLT market generated revenues of approximately €1.6 billion in 2018, of
which private laboratories amounted for approximately €0.6 billion. We have a leading market presence in the largest
Belgian market, Flanders, which had a private MLT market value of approximately €360 million in 2018. The other two
leading regions in Belgium are comparatively smaller, valued at approximately €180 million in Wallonia and
approximately €50 million in Brussels.

Over the 2016 to 2018 period, according to the industry report, Belgian MLT market volume grew by 1.5% per year. This
rate is slightly lower than in France and is primarily explained by measures taken by the country’s medical social welfare
agency to reduce medical overconsumption, including lab tests. Despite relatively tepid volume growth, the market in
general has benefitted from pricing growth, with the fixed sum of national social welfare contributions growing at
approximately 1% to 3% per year between 2010 and 2020, according to the industry report.

Going forward, as predicted by the industry report, market growth is expected to slow due to potential price erosion of
conventional prices as well as pressures on the non-regulated portion of the price paid by consumers that could be impacted
by changes in regulation enforcing more transparency to the patient.

**Healthcare system**

In line with European neighbors, medical laboratory tests are largely reimbursed by the Belgian national social welfare
agency and, as such, prices are regulated. As in France, the Belgian government uses a B-Key methodology where a
standard fixed coefficient is multiplied by a test-specific value (the “B-Value”) to determine each test’s base price. The
fixed coefficient in 2020 for clinical biology was €0.032012. The B-Values have historically remained stable, with standard
routine test ranging typically between 500 to 4,000. However, the fixed coefficient changes yearly due to indexation and
has demonstrated marginal growth increasing from €0.0309 in 2017 to €0.032012 in 2020. In addition, a fixed sum (the
“Fixed Sum”) can be added to the base price. Together, the sum of the base price and the Fixed Sum represent the
reimbursable portion of a test’s price. Historically, price growth of this reimbursable portion has been driven by the Fixed
Sum, whose growth broadly tracks inflation. CAGR for the reimbursement rate of B-Values from 2010 to 2020 was 0.29%
and the Fixed Sum per test ranged between €25 and €30, with a CAGR from 2010 to 2020 of 2.55%. Notably, and in
contrast with the French regime, in addition to the reimbursable and regulated portion of a test’s cost, in Belgium MLT


-----

operators are also able to charge clients a non-reimbursable and non-regulated price supplement (provided that the medical
laboratories are not “conventionalized” (geconventioneerd/conventionnés).

As per the industry report, the national social welfare agency contribution generally ranges between 70% to 100% of the
ultimate test price, while patient contribution ranges between 0% and 30% of the total price. In addition, patients are
charged an additional nominal administrative fee, typically up to 10%, except for certain patient categories that are exempt.
Typically, supplements in addition to regulated prices are between €0 and €5 per prescription and help drive high levels of
profitability within the Belgian market when compared to other European countries.

**Luxembourg**

Similar to France, the private MLT market in Luxembourg is primarily B2C, via high street laboratories, and prices are
regulated and fixed at the national level by the Luxembourg Ministry of Health (Ministère de la Santé) and the national
insurance scheme (Caisse Nationale de Santé). The state reimburses a partial or full amount of test expenses at the fee level
set in a nomenclature list.

**Market size and trends**

Luxembourg is the country with the highest overall healthcare spending per capita in Europe. The Luxembourgish MLT
market generated revenues of approximately €100 million in 2019, out of which ~75% is covered by private labs. Test
volumes amount to 12-13 million yearly. Despite its limited size, the Luxembourgish market displays the highest number
of tests per capita in Europe (21 tests per person per annum, twice as much as in France) and enjoys positive volume
growth. EBITDA margins (at 20-30%) in the market are high relative to the European average, reflecting the high price
per test (€10 in average, 15% higher than in France and versus 1-1.5€ in Spain) versus neighboring countries. Prices should
remain stable in the coming years. Going forward, market growth is expected to be supported by volume growth and stable
prices.

**Spain**

The MLT market in Spain is primarily B2C but unlike France and Luxembourg, private insurers and private clinics are the
main business contributors. As per the industry report, in 2019, the private MLT market segment accounted for
approximately 40% of the broader Spanish MLT market by value. This trend has been stable in the past four years, with
the remaining approximately 60% of tests carried out by public hospital labs.

**Market size and trends**

According to the industry report, the Spanish MLT market generated revenues of approximately €2.9 billion in 2019, of
which private laboratories amounted for approximately €1.2 billion. We have a leading market presence in key areas such
as Madrid and Barcelona.

According to the industry report, the Spanish MLT market has grown steadily in value over the period 2011-2019, at 2.0%
CAGR with the private market delivering a +4% CAGR. It benefitted from a strong positive volume growth trend, despite
test prices that are declining and lower than in other European countries.

**Healthcare system**

In Spain, test prices are not regulated, and determined by insurance providers. Test prices tend to be lower than the
European average, averaging €1.0 - €1.5 per test. Private insurers negotiate competitively, notably for private hospital
tenders.

The standard reimbursement route in the Spanish market is the “Capitation model” (representing approximately 60% of
the market) whereby insurance companies pay a fixed yearly amount based on the number of insured people in each
province regardless of the number of tests. In smaller provinces, insurers tend to partner with a single laboratory in
exclusivity, and the laboratory assumes all the variable demand for a fixed amount. In larger cities, insurers tend to partner


-----

with a few labs, each laboratory obtaining a share of the province economics based on the percentage of patients tested
each month.

Another major model is the “Pay-per-prescription model” (representing approximately 35% of the market) whereby
insurers reimburse per number of prescriptions regardless of number of markers (approximately 16 per prescription is the
average). In such case, each insurer partners with most of laboratory groups but the list may vary by region.

The last major model is the “Pay-per-marker model”, representing only 5% of the market and is decreasing.

**Key Market Drivers**

There are a number of key trends that we expect will impact the medical laboratory testing market in Europe, and our
business specifically. Overall, we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the medium and long-term based on
the key trends discussed below.

**_Volumes Supported by Resilient Long Term Tailwinds_**

We believe that the medical laboratory testing market will continue to benefit from a number of positive tailwinds. One of
the key drivers of testing volumes is expected to be demographic trends and lifestyle changes, which are driven by both
increased life expectancy and positive net migration balances. For example, according to the _Institut National de la_
_Statistique et des Études Économiques (“INSEE”), the French population increased at a CAGR of 0.4% between 2007 and_
2020 while the number of individuals aged 60 and over also grew within the same period. INSEE reported that the French
population aged 60 and over accounted for approximately 26% of the total population in 2020, while in 2007 it accounted
for only approximately 21%. Further, recent years have seen the growth of chronic diseases that result from certain lifestyle
choices, such as low levels of physical activity, malnutrition and stress, as well as aging. We believe that these demographic
trends will lead to increased demand for healthcare services and, as a result, increase the volume of medical testing.

Similarly, according to Statistics Belgium (the public entity for population data in Belgium), the Belgium population
increased at a CAGR of 0.6% between 2009 and 2020, while the number of individuals aged 65 and over grew to represent
approximately 19% of the total population in 2020, compared to 17% in 2009. As for France, we believe that these
demographic trends will lead to increased demand for medical testing services.

**_Shift Towards Preventative Medical Care_**

According to the industry report, the average number of tests prescribed per medical consultation in grew at a rate of
between 3.0% to 3.5% between 2014 and 2019. Healthcare policies are increasingly focusing on preventive care as
politicians and doctors alike recognize the benefits of early detection and prevention of chronic and severe diseases, both
from a public budget and medical perspective. As a result, in France, guidelines prepared by the Haute Autorité de Santé
push for increased prevention and screening tests. In Belgium, although part of the cost of testing is borne by the patient,
there is a gradually increasing demand for preventative testing. We believe that this trend, which is already accelerated by
the prevalence of COVID-19 tests, is set to continue and will drive overall demand and volumes for laboratory testing
services.

**_Pricing Trends_**

In France, Belgium and Luxembourg, medical laboratory test prices are driven by public budgets. Although budget
constraints have historically limited pricing growth in both markets, such constraints have not constrained overall revenue
growth.

In France, in order to contain healthcare spending, CNAM has historically decreased test prices to ensure that its
expenditures remain below volume growth. Over 2014 to 2019, CNAM agreed on a growth rate of 0.25% per year in the
medical laboratory testing budget, resulting in price erosion given the higher growth of test volumes. In the Current
Triennial Plan, CNAM has allowed for higher annual growth rate of CNAM expenses ranging from 0.40% to 0.60% over
the period. However, volume growth is expected to outpace this, thereby continuing to drive price erosion.


-----

According to the industry report, historical prices of routine tests in the private medical laboratory testing market in
Belgium have increased by approximately 1% per annum from 2010 and 2020, with national social welfare agency
contributions roughly tracking inflation and patient contribution levels remaining stable. In the future, we believe the
market could face some price erosion due to a reduction in the national welfare agency contribution as Belgium has a high
and increasing social security deficit.

On the contrary, Luxembourg enjoys high average price per test (approximately 15% higher than in France) and prices
have been stable since 2015. No further price erosion is anticipated in the coming years.

In general, pricing pressures remain part of operating in the medical laboratory test market and we expect such pressures
to continue in the future. We believe that our market leading position, dense laboratory network and economies of scale
put us at an advantage compared to smaller peers to withstand future pricing pressures.

**_Market Consolidation_**

Consolidation has been a key feature of the European laboratory testing market in the recent past. According to the industry
report, in France, the top six players in 2019 represented approximately 70% of total market value, compared to
approximately 30% in 2013. We believe that this trend towards consolidation will continue being a feature of the market
due to a combination of factors, including pricing pressures from payers, enhanced quality and accreditation standards and
the increasing complexity and technical demands of tests. We expect that these higher fixed costs, coupled with continuous
pricing pressure, will make it more difficult for smaller players to maintain their current levels of profitability. As has been
seen in the past, we expect that this will drive M&A activity as consolidation allows laboratories to achieve the critical size
necessary to make up for diminishing marginal revenues from individual tests due to government-imposed price reductions.
We believe that this will create opportunities for larger players, including Biogroup, to make tuck-in acquisitions to increase
their economies of scale and lab density.

**_New Technologies_**

As new technologies develop, we believe laboratories will experience pressure to upgrade their testing portfolio and adopt
new standards. The costs of compliance with new quality standards and the continual need to invest in new testing
equipment favors larger participants with greater resources available for these expenditures. This has clearly been
demonstrated since the COVID-19 outbreak when larger operators, including Biogroup, were able to make the required
investments to capture a larger part of the newly-created market.

**Competition**

We are one of the leading players in our sector within our target geographies. On an individual basis, our clinical
laboratories compete with independent clinical laboratories, hospital-based laboratories (both privately and publicly
owned) and doctor office laboratories. At a Group level, our laboratories compete with other national, European and
international groups. In general, competition stems from existing laboratories and groups as competition from new entrants
is limited due to high start-up costs as a result of stringent regulations, complex supply chain requirements and clear scale
advantages which make it hard to credibly launch testing laboratories on a small scale.

In the routine medical laboratory testing market, laboratory selection can be determined by the healthcare provider or
directly by the patient. Healthcare providers tend to base their selection on accuracy, timeliness, consistency, breadth of
tests performed and convenience (such as valuing sample pick-up services or online results platforms). Patients that are
free to select where they are tested usually base their decision on a laboratory’s proximity to their home or workplace.
Other important considerations for patients include opening hours, service quality (including waiting time and delivery of
results in expected timeframe) and the availability of online results.

As convenience and proximity to clients are paramount in winning business, and due to the regulated fee structure of the
routine laboratory testing markets, the most successful and profitable industry participants require large absolute size and
dense regional networks. The combination of these two factors allows the largest, densest players to benefit from both
significant economies of scale and higher volume throughputs leading to high margins and an ability to absorb regulatory


-----

changes better than smaller competitors. As a result, M&A is an important factor in successfully competing within the
medical laboratory testing market. We have a strong track record of successfully acquiring and integrating smaller
independent and regional laboratories, having acquired more than 600 labs over the last five years.

The competitive landscape for the private routine laboratory testing market is different in France and in Belgium, though
we compete with local independent laboratories, regional and national/international groups across both geographies.

In France, the private medical laboratory testing market has been rapidly consolidating due to regulatory changes that have
put pressure on the profitability of smaller operators. According to the industry report, the top six players in the industry
accounted for approximately 72% of the market by value in 2020, compared to approximately 30% in 2013. We have been
at the forefront of this trend and have made a number of targeted acquisitions over the recent past to grow our scale and
profitability. As a result, based on historic data in the industry report, we believe we are the market leader in France with
approximately 19% of total market share by value followed by Cerba (approximately 17%), Inovie (approximately 10%)
and Synlab (approximately 10%), excluding COVID impact. On a regional basis, we enjoy a market-leading position in
seven French regions (Grand-Est, Pays de la Loire, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Corse, Île-de-France, PACA and Bourgogne-
Franche-Comté).

In Belgium, according to the industry report, the MLT market was relatively consolidated in 2018, with the top six players
accounting for approximately 65% to 70% of market by value with different players leading across each of these regions.
At a national level, we are the largest player according to the industry report, with approximately a 27% market share by
value followed by Sonic Healthcare (approximately 15%) and Synlab (approximately 8%). We are active in Flanders and
since our acquisition of Laboratoires Réunis Belgique in Brussels and Wallonia. Going forward, we expect market
consolidation to increase on the back of pricing pressures, which will make it more difficult for smaller independent players
to maintain existing levels of profitability. We are well placed to act as a consolidator in the Belgian market given our size
and successful M&A experience.

In Luxembourg, the private MLT market is highly concentrated, with the top 6 players representing over 90% of blood
collection centers. LLR Luxembourg is the second largest laboratory company in Luxembourg, and, based on management
estimates, with a COVID-19-adjusted market share of about 33% in 2020.

In Spain, according to the industry report, the private MLT market was still highly fragmented in 2021, with the top seven
players accounting for only approximately 35% of the market by value. At a national level, we have approximately an 8%
market share by value (including Analiza in which we have an indirect investment and which is not consolidated in our
financial results), behind Synlab (10%), and followed by Eurofins (approximately 5%), and Echevarne (approximately
5%). Going forward, we expect market consolidation to increase and we are well placed to act as a consolidator in the
Spanish market given our size and successful M&A experience.

**COVID-19 Pandemic**

The COVID-19 crisis has had a profound impact on the medical laboratory testing market across Europe, especially in the
context of governments’ increased requirement for COVID-19 testing. We have been at the forefront of these
developments, particularly in France, where our scale and agility allowed us to react quickly to the evolving market
landscape.

**_Impact on Routine Testing Volumes_**

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March 2020, governments across Europe, including in France and
Belgium, imposed lockdowns which had a profound impact on the MLT markets’ testing volumes. According to the
industry report, between March 17 and May 11, the first period of lockdown in France, testing volumes decreased by
roughly 40% to 50% when compared to the same period in 2019. During this period, while vital tests were not impacted
(for example, tests for patients under chemotherapy, people with severe kidney failure or pregnant women), less critical,
routine tests were largely cancelled or postponed. Nevertheless, according to the industry report, strong recovery of these
routine tests post-lockdown has limited the overall loss of volumes for traditional tests to 5% to 6% over 2020 for private
MLT players in France, representing roughly €160 million to €200 million of reduced spending by CNAM.


-----

**_COVID-19 Testing has Provided Additional Growth_**

Despite having a negative impact on the volumes of traditional tests during the lockdown, the COVID-19 crisis has had a
net positive impact on the private MLT market due to additional business requirements driven by COVID-19 testing. Three
types of COVID-19 tests are currently on the market (PCR, full serological tests and quick serological test), of which two
are performed in laboratories (PCR tests and full serological tests), while the quick serological test can be performed at
home. While the two in-lab tests were fully reimbursed by the French state until October 15, 2021, at-home tests were not
covered.

PCR tests detect the presence of COVID-19 in a sample and can determine whether a patient is contagious. The test, which
uses a nasopharyngeal sample, is able to detect the virus through amplification technology and is roughly 90% accurate.
The price of the PCR test has been set by CNAM at €73.59 per test and has been 100% reimbursed by the French Social
Security system since May 11, 2020. Reimbursement policies have been updated firstly on 15[th] December 2020, to require
certain conditions to be met to qualify for full reimbursement: PCR testing services providers in France would be
reimbursed by the government in full only if the test results were provided within 12 hours from testing. For example, as
of December 15, 2020, PCR testing services providers in France would be reimbursed by the government for €73.59 in
total only if the test results are provided within 12 hours from testing. If test results are provided between 12 and 24 hours
after testing, testing service providers would be reimbursed for €43.20 per test; between 24 and 48 hours, €31 per test; and
after 48 hours, €0 per test. PCR test tariffs have been revised downwards by €20 to circa €45 successively in April 2021
and then in June 2021. Starting on October, 15[th] 2021, COVID testing costed 43.89€, and was no longer be reimbursed for
non-vaccinated people without a prescription except in specific circumstances. Serological tests detect antibodies to the
virus in a sample and identify immunized individuals who were infected by COVID-19 virus at some point in the past. It
uses machine detection of the antigen-antibody pair by colorimetry / fluorescence (“ELISA5”) or luminescence (“CLIA6”)
and has 99% accuracy. As per the industry report, the price per test is fixed by CNAM at approximately €30 and has been
fully reimbursed by CNAM for patients with a prescription since May 18.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the French government has deployed these tests in scale to help contain the development
of the outbreak in the country, in particular allowing people to be tested for free without medical prescriptions or any
advance payment. According to the Direction de la Recherche, des Études, de l’Évaluation et des Statistiques (“DREES”),
86 million cumulative PCR tests had been performed in France between March 1, 2020 and August 1, 2021, with a majority
of them conducted in cities.

According to the Institut National d’Assurance Maladie-Invalidité (“RIZIV/INAMI”), the Belgian government is fully
financing all three types of COVID-19 tests where patients exhibit symptoms or have a medical prescription. Per Sciensano,
Belgium’s Scientific Institute for Public Health, roughly 7 million of COVID-19 tests have been performed in Belgium in
2020 and already more than 13 million in 2021 (as of October 8, 2021).

We have been at the forefront of these developments in both France and Belgium and have been able to leverage our large
installed base and advantageous geographical footprint to capture a significant share of testing volumes related to COVID-
19. Biogroup has been assisting both the French and Belgian governments in the fight to contain the pandemic by
processing approximately 19% of total French testing volumes and approximately 13% of total Belgian testing volumes.
We played a key role in performing COVID-19 tests with our ability to deliver results faster than our competitors, and the
intense media coverage highlighting us as one of the major players of MLT markets boosted our brand awareness. In
addition, our Luxembourg subsidiary LLR Luxembourg, acquired in July 2021, has been the sole private testing provider
chosen by the Government to support its first phase of large scale testing.

In the mid to long-term, due to the central role medical lab operators have played through the pandemic, we expect to
benefit from stronger bargaining power in future price and regulation negotiations with health authorities. In addition,
while large operators such as ours were able to make requisite investments to meet testing requirements through the crisis,
smaller labs were more constrained given the upfront costs of COVID-19 testing equipment. As such, the overall health of
smaller labs has been more negatively impacted by the crisis, which could pave the way for additional consolidation
opportunities going forward.

**Business**

**Overview**

We are a leading routine diagnostics company in Europe and we believe we are the leading private medical laboratory
services company by market share in France and Belgium, providing medical laboratory testing services through a large
and dense network of 1,605 collection sites across seven regions in France, one region in Belgium and in six other regions
abroad (including the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Brazil) as of the date of this offering
memorandum. We focus mainly on routine lab testing which is conducted exclusively in-house and also offer specialized
tests which can be performed in-house or outsourced to our outsourcing partners. Our in-house testing generally comprises
approximately 98% of our test volume. We outsource only a small portion of specialized tests with low demand (thereby
less profitable to invest in resources to conduct the tests in-house). In France, our customers are mainly patients, whereas
our Belgian customers are generally both doctors and patients. Our local technical platforms also assist nearby clinics with
their medical testing demands.

We perform a range of over 372 medical lab tests with varying degrees of automation, complexity and volume (including
clinical biochemistry, molecular diagnostics, infertility diagnosis, tumor marker testing, microbiology, cytology and
pathology, allergy tests and genetic tests) for patients who have either generally been prescribed these tests by their doctors
or who elect to get tested for certain non-prescribed medical tests.

We have grown our market presence in France, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg through acquisitions of technical
platforms and large networks of nearby collection sites in regions with attractive demographic factors (such as high density
populations, aging populations and affluence), followed by smaller bolt-on acquisitions to create density around technical
platforms and ensure maximization of operating efficiency. Through 57 acquisitions since 2015, we have demonstrated
our ability to consistently deliver on forecast synergies and cost savings, and extract high levels of profitability. Our founder
and shareholder Dr. Stéphane Eimer’s strategic vision and successful track record of consolidation, expertise, industry
knowledge and network, further assisted by our investors and competent management at local laboratory levels, historically
have been an important differentiator during these acquisitions, and our culture as a scientifically-led organization (driven
by ownership by a medical biologist instead of a financial sponsor) uniquely sets us apart from our competitors.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our net sales were €2,107.5 million and our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
(excluding COVID-19 impact) was €468.7 million. See “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other
_Financial and Operating Data.”_

**Our History**

We were founded in 1998 by Dr. Stéphane Eimer, a medical biologist, as a single laboratory in Wittelsheim, Alsace, France.
Our operations were gradually developed in the Grand Est (Greater East) region through the creation and acquisition of
collection sites before expanding into other regions of France.

In 2015, we targeted the Ile-de-France (greater Paris) region because we identified this region as growing rapidly and with
a strong potential for optimization. We acquired Biolam-LCD, the then leading independent laboratory services company
in Ile-de-France. We also acquired EX in 2016, Bioépine in 2017 and BPO, BioSynergie, Biolaboplus, Biolabs and
Bioarcades in 2018 to further strengthen our market position in this region.

In 2016 and 2017, we expanded our business in Limousin through the acquisition of Astralab and LLA and to Grand Est
region through the acquisition of Biosanté and Laboratoire Saint Rémy.

In 2018, we acquired 2A2B, then the co-leading lab testing company in Corsica, Evolab and Medilab Est in Grand Est and
Bioesterel, the leading laboratory services company in Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur (“PACA”).

In 2019, we further strengthened our market position by acquiring a total of 11 laboratory services companies. Among
others, we acquired laboratory testing companies in PACA (Bioazur and Biolittoral), Ile-de-France (Biomag, LBC and

Biosaga) and Grand Est (ABO Labo and GBA). We also acquired Unilians Group which was a leading laboratory services
company in Auvergne Rhône-Alpes (“AURA”).

In 2020, we secured a leading position in AURA with the acquisition of Unilians Biogroup (formerly known as Dyomedea-
Neolab) and certain of its subsidiaries (the “Unilians Biogroup Acquisition”) in the central and western regions of France
(“Centre and Grand Ouest”, including the Pays de la Loire, Centre Val de Loire and Bretagne regions) with the
acquisition of Réseau Bio, Sèvre Biologie, Biomélis and Laborizon. These investments were financed in part by Caisse de
Dépôt et de Placement du Québec (“CDPQ”), which is one of our institutional investors. See “Principal Shareholders,
_Investors and Related Party Transactions”._

In October 2020, we expanded our operations to Belgian market through acquisition of eight companies of Medina Group,
which we believe to be the leading laboratory operating group in Belgium. These investments were financed in part by
Intermediate Capital Group (“ICG”), which is one of our institutional investors. In addition, Straco, which previously
owned the Medina Group, has since become one of our institutional investors by reinvesting in our Group part of its
proceeds from the Medina Acquisition. See “Principal Shareholders, Investors and Related Party Transactions”.

Over the past two years, we have expanded outside of France by investing in companies offering leading market positions
and competitive EBITDA margins relative to their local markets, entering Belgium in 2020 and Spain and Luxembourg in
2021. Following the development strategy we have successfully deployed in France, we are now further densifying and
expanding our network in Belgium with the acquisition of LLR Belgique, which is expected to close in November 2021.
In Spain, notably where private insurers cover the majority of the test costs, we have sought to align our interests with
leading insurer ASISA by taking a participation in Analiza alongside them. Our Spanish presence was further enhanced
with our acquisition of Cerba Internacional in October 2021. We had significant other acquisition activity in 2021 in France.
In March, we acquired Labo Sambourg and Mayo Bio. In April, we acquired Biocéliande. In July, we acquired Alphabio,
Viollet-Belmont and Oriade Noviale. In July, we acquired Bio Sites. In October, we acquired Bio-Santis and Medilys.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we operate in seven regions in France, one region in Belgium and in six other
regions abroad (including the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Brazil) totaling
approximately 1,605 collection sites and 161 technical platforms (which includes 43 principal technical platforms and 14
technical platforms that specialize in assisted reproductive technology in France). The table below set forth the number of
collection sites, number of technical platforms (including principal technical platforms) and the respective market shares

(1) Our technical platforms include (i) principal technical platforms, which have capabilities to perform a broad range of tests and analyses for
samples collected across various collection sites in the respective region, and (ii) local technical platforms, which have limited testing
capabilities catering to the needs of nearby sites or clinics only, including for any emergency testing nearby clinics may require.

(2) Our market share in each region we operate is calculated by dividing Pro Forma Net Sales (excluding COVID-19 impact) realized by Biogroup

in the region by the total value of the private medical laboratory testing market in the region. Pro Forma Net Sales represents the sum of our

pro forma net sales in France for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 and our net sales abroad (in Belgium, the UK, Luxembourg, Spain,

Portugal, Switzerland and Brazil), excluding divested sites.

(3) Biogroup UK only provides COVID-19 tests in the London area.

(4) A significant part of Biogroup collection sites in Spain are not proprietary.

(5) Biogroup is only active in Medical Imaging in Portugal so far.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Present in growing and resilient markets characterized by strong fundamentals and providing further growth_**
**_opportunities_**

Our core markets are the routine outpatient private laboratory testing markets in France, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg.
France and Belgium represented €4.6 billion and €0.6 billion in net sales in 2020, respectively, and France, Belgium, Spain
and Luxembourg generated approximately €4.7 billion, €0.6 billion, €2.9 billion and €0.1 billion in net sales in 2019,
respectively. We believe that we benefit from resilient, non-cyclical demand for clinical diagnostics services that delivers
reliable organic growth. This growth is due in part to favorable market drivers in our markets, such as an aging populations,


-----

population growth, growth in the prevalence of chronic diseases, driven by lifestyle trends such as low levels of physical
activity, poor nutrition and stress, an increase in the number of consultations per inhabitant and number of tests per
consultation and increasing focus on disease prevention. We believe these factors are conducive to increased testing
frequency, driving volume growth in the market, while the essential nature of the testing services we provide contributes
to demand resilience, as exhibited during the COVID-19 pandemic by the significant increase in volume of medical tests
due to the demand for COVID-19-related testing, as well as by the gradual return of routine testing volume to normal levels
as movement and other restrictions have been lifted.

Prompt and accurate diagnostic testing improves the quality of patient care and reduces the overall cost of healthcare. As
a result, the governments in most of the markets in which we operate, including France, Belgium and Luxembourg (which
fund a significant proportion of the value of testing in their respective countries including approximately 70% for France
and between 70% and 100% for Belgium) have promoted the use of medical testing as preventive care, which has led to
growth in demand for medical lab testing generally. Due to the high volume of testing needs and limited testing capacity
of the public sector, public hospital laboratories have increasingly outsourced testing to private providers. The fiscal
constraints of the public sector further contribute to the private sector’s continued growth to meet the increasing demand.
In Spain, private insurers (who cover approximately 85% of the cost of tests generated by private labs) are also following
the trend of more preventative testing leading to an increase in the number of markers tested per test.

Net sales of laboratory companies in France, Belgium and Luxembourg are subject to annual budgets established in advance
through industry-wide agreements with regulatory authorities, which set the prices for routine medical testing in advance.
For example, in France, pursuant to a triennial agreement in March 2020 with medical biologists’ labor unions (the
“Current Triennial Plan”), the annual budget growth for medical lab tests is set for three years, and allows an increase of
up to 0.40% in 2020, 0.50% in 2021 and 0.60% in 2022, excluding COVID-19 related tests. In Belgium, prices of routine
tests in the private medical laboratory testing market in Belgium are set by the national healthcare regulatory body,
RIZIV/INAMI, and are revised at least on an annual basis and historically have increased by approximately 1% per annum
since 2010, with national social welfare agency contributions roughly tracking inflation and patient contribution levels
remaining stable. In Luxembourg, prices are set by the Ministry of Health and the national insurance scheme (Caisse
_Nationale de Santé). In 2018, a new framework was put in place that included a quotation grid setting out the tests that are_
eligible for CNS payments, as well as their respective prices. This was followed by price increases in 2019 (2.50% in
January 2019 and 5.00% in May 2019) that led, together with increased testing volumes in 2019 and 2020, to CNS spending
approximately €80 million in 2019 (which was a 23% increase compared to 2018) and €106 million in 2020 (which was a
32.5% increase compared to 2019). As a result, certain variables that contribute to our net sales, including pricing, are
somewhat predictable. These annual budgets set a baseline, with prices increasing or decreasing depending on how the
market value of laboratory testing compares to the annual budgets. In addition to the government-regulated price, in
Belgium we have the option to charge the patient an additional amount, typically up to 10% of the government-regulated
price. Although these agreements create significant pricing pressure, they also protect our industry from unforeseen
external shocks, because they provide an additional budget for a predetermined level of overall market growth and to meet
the increased need for tests during an exceptional event.

The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates how this system works. Regulatory authorities in France, Belgium and Luxembourg
provided an additional budget for COVID-19-related tests separate from its annual budget for lab testing. However, there
was also decrease in routine medical lab testing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite recent amendments to the reimbursement framework in France that precludes reimbursement for most
unvaccinated adults, see “Regulation–France–Pricing and Reimbursement”, we expect that the increased demand for
COVID-19-related testing activity (such as polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) and serology testing), which had not
previously contributed to the market value of traditional medical laboratory testing services, will continue to provide
additional upside to lab operators in the short term. In the long-term, the incremental PCR testing capacity we have
established can be used for tests to detect non-COVID-19-related infectious diseases, such as microbiology tests, which
we expect will mitigate future decreases in PCR testing volumes for COVID-19. We also expect routine testing volumes
to increase from greater public familiarity with diagnostic testing and its benefits, as well as the emergence of new tests in
the “routine” segment of the market. Moreover, the increased public awareness of the central importance of medical
laboratory testing services resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may benefit medical laboratory testing providers in


-----

future price negotiations with the relevant regulatory authorities. We believe we are well placed to benefit from these
trends, because we were amongst the first private European testing providers to invest in the PCR testing equipment and
to have provided PCR testing in our French markets. In addition, our Luxembourg subsidiary Les Laboratoires Réunis,
acquired in July 2021, has been the sole private testing provider chosen by the Government to support its first phase of
large scale testing.

For a further discussion of our markets and their underlying competitive dynamics, see “Industry”.

**_Leading European market position driving strong historical growth and EBITDA margin_**

We believe we are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in our core markets of France and
Belgium. In addition, we entered the Spanish and Luxembourg markets through acquisition in 2021 and believe we are
already are the second largest laboratory group in Luxembourg based on net sales. For the twelve months ended June 30,
2021, we generated net sales of €2,107.5 million, including net sales of €1,915.4 million in France and €180.1 million of
net sales in Belgium through the Medina Group, which we acquired in October 2020. As a large incumbent operator in all
of our markets, we are able to leverage significant economies of scale both (i) financially, benefitting from strong
negotiating positions with key suppliers and (ii) operationally, through our ability to react quickly and at scale to respond
to regulatory or other changes, such as our rapid roll-out of COVID-19-related PCR testing capabilities at the start of the
pandemic. These attributes have allowed us to deliver a competitive Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19
impact) margin of 35.2% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

Through our large-scale and successful consolidation of smaller operators, we have developed a network of approximately
1,605 collection sites across Europe with the capacity to deliver up to 176,500 tests per day as of September 2021.
Moreover, we have historically experienced very low churn among our medical biologists. Biologists at acquired
laboratories are incentivized to remain within our Group following the acquisition and integration of targets due to a
combination of financial, structural and cultural factors, such as our profit sharing system, the decentralized management
of each laboratory site, which leverages centralized regional technical platform capabilities to achieve cost savings, and
the fact that we are owned and managed by Dr. Stéphane Eimer, a medical biologist. This low churn has historically
provided us with substantial institutional knowledge at both the local and regional levels, promoting continuity and
operational efficiency as new targets are integrated into our Group’s network on an ongoing basis.

We have executed our consolidation strategy with discipline and speed, having successfully integrated 57 acquisitions
since 2015. For example, the 2020 Acquisitions and acquisitions made in 2019 (including (Unilians Biogroup, Laborizon
and Medina) have contributed an increase of €950.2 million to our net sales in the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.
The chart below sets forth the growth in the number of our collection sites since 2015.


-----

Our consolidation strategy has allowed us to generate, on a compounded basis, an annual net sales growth rate of over 74%
and an annual pro forma adjusted EBITDA growth rate of over 83% from 2015 to 2020, demonstrating the effectiveness
of scale in enhancing our financial performance. A key factor in ensuring uplifts in EBITDA margins are effectively
extracted from new acquisitions is our ability to quickly manage staff costs (mainly by substituting part of the cash
compensation of biologists at the newly acquired laboratory with equity), supplier costs (through application of the terms
of our existing framework agreements immediately after closing and post-acquisition reagent price renegotiations with
suppliers benefiting from the Group’s increased scale) and other operating costs of target labs in order to rapidly realize
operating synergies.

**_Integrated and efficient business model with a dense network of collection sites covering a wide range of diagnostic_**
**_applications in-house_**

We believe our integrated network model allows us to benefit from significant cost savings and a high utilization rate of
our technical platforms, which leads to greater profitability. We have focused on building a series of dense networks in
each of the geographic regions we have chosen to enter, leveraging a “hub-and-spoke” network model of distributed
collection sites clustered tightly around state-of-the-art, well-invested technical platforms with, in our view, the latest and
most efficient equipment. With an average of 75 collection sites per region in France as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum (by categorizing our operating regions into a total of 11 regions in France), in contrast to a competitor
average of 30 in 2019, we are able to centralize sample analysis of a large number of collection sites around each of our
best-in-class technical platforms to achieve cost savings and optimize the utilization rate for each platform.

We have focused strategically on regions within France that exhibit attractive fundamental demographic characteristics,
such as rapidly growing or aging populations, metropolitan areas with above-average population density and relative
affluence. These areas, such as Ile-de-France, Auvergne Rhône-Alpes and the PACA regions, drive higher testing volumes
than more rural or less affluent regions and consequently enable us to operate at greater levels of efficiency with faster test
turnaround speeds and higher margins. In line with this strategy, we entered the Belgian market through our acquisition of
the Medina Group in October 2020, which is located in densely populated areas, thus enabling a high level of operational
efficiency. Moreover, the future acquisition of LLR Belgique, for which a letter of intent was signed in August 2021, will
enable us to further densify our network in Bruxelles and increase our reach to the densest areas in Wallonia. Our latest
additions in Spain and Luxembourg follow the same approach of penetrating dense areas while constituting a basis for
potential further consolidation and thus increase margins.

We cover all of the routine laboratory testing phases in-house, from initial collection of samples from patients or healthcare
providers to post-analytical biological validation and results reporting. Approximately 97% of our net sales in 2020 were
derived from our testing services that are conducted in-house. Our strong in-house analytical capabilities (including our
innovative testing automation capabilities enabled by best-in-class equipment), combined with our dense network of
collection sites located in close proximity to technical platforms (as well as to large epidemic clusters), allow us to optimize


-----

our operations and achieve a quick turnaround of testing results with fewer staff. We estimate that we revert with test
results within 12 hours for a majority of tests. We also offer a comprehensive service across a wide scope of medical tests,
including clinical chemistry, hematology, allergy, microbiology, immunochemistry, molecular diagnostics, cytology and
fertility tests. See “Business—Our Business—Overview” for more information.

Furthermore, for our operations in France and Luxembourg in particular, we believe that our strategic focus on the B2C
routine lab segment and limited exposure to outsourced testing drive our EBITDA margin outperformance. By
concentrating on B2C routine lab testing (which generally generates a higher margin than B2B) and maintaining limited
outsourcing (which is generally more expensive than in-house testing), we benefit from greater profitability than some of
our peers that have a B2B business model and/or outsource a greater proportion of tests. We generally perform
approximately 98% of our analysis by volume in-house, and outsource only a small portion of testing to our outsourcing
partner in France, Biomnis, for certain specialized tests with low demand (and therefore less profitable to invest in resources
to conduct the tests in-house). If an outsourced test becomes sufficiently recurrent, we may decide to make an investment
and purchase or lease the necessary equipment and hire the appropriate staff to be able to perform the test in-house. See
“Business—Our Business” for more information.

Finally, our centralized procurement function and limited number of suppliers allow us to better absorb pricing pressures
and improve profitability. We generally engage only one or two suppliers per service and type of purchase, who provide
the relevant service and products nationally to our collection sites and technical platforms. This centralization helps our
group-level procurement team negotiate better terms with our reagent and equipment suppliers pursuant to master supply
agreements, which also benefit our acquired targets post-acquisition. This approach allows us to achieve a competitive net
sales margin while harmonizing best practices across our network. See “Business—Our Suppliers” for more information.

**_Incumbent leadership position strengthened by significant barriers to entry_**

We believe that our competitive position is bolstered by several significant barriers to entry for private medical lab testing
market in France, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg.

We operate in a highly regulated industry with stringent, complex mandatory operating license accreditation frameworks.
These requirements can be onerous for providers without a critical scale in the market to support the resources necessary
to achieve and maintain compliance, creating an environment naturally conducive to consolidation. We are subject to
onerous licensing and certification regimes, particularly in Belgium where there is a de facto stop on the granting of new
licenses, thus making it difficult to increase the number of new licenses. We collaborate closely with regulators to stay up–
to-date with the latest regulatory developments in the markets where we operate. For our French operations in particular,
our Quality Director is also a member of COFRAC (Comité français d’accréditation), which supervises French laboratories
to ensure that they are up–to-date on regulatory requirements. Our relationship with COFRAC provides us with a significant
advantage compared to new entrants, particularly with respect to obtaining accreditation under the new accreditation
requirement pursuant to the more rigorous ISO 15189 standard. As of October 31, 2021, our laboratories and facilities in
France were 100% accredited by COFRAC under the ISO 15189 standard, and we aim to obtain accreditation under the
ISO 9001 standard by 2023. In our Belgian operations, all of our collection sites and technical platforms are accredited
under the relevant quality standards issued by Sciensano, Belgium’s Scientific Institute for Public Health. All but one of
our collection sites in Belgium have obtained the BELAC accreditation in line with the ISO 15189 standard. See
“Business—Quality Standards” for more information.

Moreover, the constraints on ownership of laboratory companies in France are burdensome to potential market entrants, in
particular overseas investors, making it more difficult to achieve scale or establish a new business. French law requires in-
house biologists to retain a majority of voting rights and, subject to certain exceptions, share capital of the subsidiaries they
own. Generally, our acquisition targets’ biologists will retain some equity interest post-acquisition. See “Business—Our
_Corporate Structure (SEL/SELAS)” and “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure” for more information._

Our “hub-and-spoke” network model further allows us to leverage economies of scale. We operate in several regions
through a combination of multiple collection sites serviced by a centralized technical platform where tests are actually
performed, which allows us to reduce our fixed costs (comprised largely of staff and facilities costs) and deliver a broad


-----

range of testing services at a lower cost per unit than a new entrant is likely to be able to achieve. This scale also gives us
negotiating power to procure reagents and equipment on more advantageous terms, as well as in M&A processes.

Further, our industry know-how and deep scientific expertise, combined with our dense network of collection sites, allow
us to deliver diagnostic testing services quickly and accurately at the convenience of the customers. Convenience (including
proximity for individual patients, our main customers in France and Luxembourg), fast turnaround and quality of testing
results are important factors for patients and doctors (our main customers in Belgium) in selecting laboratories. As an
incumbent already equipped with experienced biologists across multiple regions and state-of-the-art technical platforms
with the latest technology that can handle large testing volumes efficiently, we have been able to promptly deliver testing
results for a broad range of routine lab tests.

Our successful track record and our strong reputation also act as powerful barriers to entry. Developing a reputation for
convenience and quality takes time to build, and we believe Biogroup’s strong reputation (including the strength of our
subsidiaries’ reputations, such as Medina Group) in diagnostic services in our markets enables us to attract customers, staff
and potential acquisition targets over competitors, ensuring that our testing volumes, skill and technical capabilities are
maintained and grow over time. The high-volume nature of the routine laboratory testing business requires substantial
managerial and organizational competence to implement high quality standards throughout the network. Our decentralized
management structure allows for best practices to be identified based on local experience, while our scale and infrastructure
allow for best practices to be shared and implemented across the Group. Our fast turnaround in delivering test results and
the convenience of the proximity of testing sites to patients, due to our existing dense network in the regions we operate,
also provide a significant advantage over new entrants. Moreover, for our Belgian operations, we believe that our
commitment to building and maintaining relationships with doctors, is also integral to continuing to grow our market share.
Doctors tend to return to their existing preferred laboratory services provider as a one-stop shop for all of the analyses they
need for their patients, and our existing relationship with these customers makes it more difficult for entrants to penetrate.
In Spain where private insurers cover approximately 85% of the cost of tests realized by private labs, we have invested in
Analiza alongside leading Spanish insurer ASISA. As the 2[nd] largest Group in Spain in terms of revenue, based on
management estimates (when including Analiza in Spain, whose results are not currently consolidated in the Group’s
financial statements), our concentrated presence in the four largest autonomous regions by inhabitants and our critical size
puts us in a position to be a reference partner for private insurers and large private hospitals externalizing their tests. Lastly,
our profile has increased significantly as a result of our COVID-19 testing response due in part to increased media coverage,
which will be difficult for other entrants to establish in the short-term.

**_Established consolidation strategy with disciplined acquisition criteria_**

We have a strong track record as a preeminent consolidator in the French diagnostic testing space. More recently,
capitalizing on our French leadership position, we have successfully entered dynamic new markets with acquisitions in
Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain. Through 57 acquisitions since 2015, we have demonstrated an ability to consistently
deliver on forecast synergies and effectively integrate newly acquired laboratories with speed and efficiency. We maintain
a proven and established M&A policy, drawing on the experience and track record of our senior leadership team to facilitate
rapid decision making through a standardized M&A process.

The consolidation strategy that we have pursued since 2015 has been a balance of speed with discipline. We have deployed
a tactical roll-up approach on a region-by-region basis, focusing on establishing technical platform hubs in new,
strategically attractive geographic regions meeting certain criteria (including the demographic factors described above),
balanced with smaller bolt-on acquisitions to create density around the technical platform and ensure maximization of
operating efficiency. Our decentralized management model also allows us to leverage our local management’s knowledge
and relationships in the regions in which we operate to source potential acquisitions and optimize post-acquisition
integration measures, such as opening new collection sites in the best locations based on their local knowledge and
harmonization of our network. We also benefit from their existing relationship with local governmental bodies and regional
health agencies.

The potential for synergies and cost savings with our existing technical platform and laboratory network is an important
criteria for our selection of targets for future acquisitions. We have a successful track record of achieving synergies and
cost savings due in part to our systematic approach of promptly integrating targets into our centralized framework


-----

agreements, the majority of which we are able to achieve between the first day following the closing of the acquisition and
within a few weeks thereafter. For example, our acquisitions of Bioesterel in December 2018, Biolittoral in June 2019 and
Laborizon in July 2020 resulted in EBITDA margin increases which exceeded our initial target margin. See “Business—
_Our Growth through Acquisitions” for more information on the increases in EBITDA margin. We have our targets accede_
to our supplier master agreements as soon as possible post-acquisition, which allows the targets to benefit from our existing
competitive price and fee arrangements soon after an acquisition has been completed. We also selectively conduct certain
tests previously outsourced by the target in-house, outsourcing those that remain to Biomnis benefitting from our existing
contractual outsourcing arrangements at a competitive margin. See “Business—Our Growth through Acquisitions” for more
information.

In addition, we believe that the French regulatory regime governing the ownership of laboratory companies aligns the
interests of our Group and our targets and minimizes churn of senior-level specialized biologists at the target level. The
biologists’ retention of an equity stake at the target level also prevents disruption of the target’s business post-acquisition
and facilitates the post-acquisition integration process.

Over the past two years, we have expanded outside of France by investing in companies offering leading market positions
and competitive EBITDA margins relative to their local markets, entering Belgium in 2020 and Spain and Luxembourg in
2021. Following the development strategy we have successfully deployed in France, we are now further densifying and
expanding our network in Belgium with the acquisition of LLR Belgique, which is expected to close in November 2021.
In Spain, notably where private insurers cover the majority of the test costs, we have sought to align our interests with
leading insurer ASISA by taking a participation in Analiza alongside them. Our Spanish presence was further enhanced
with our acquisition of Cerba Internacional in October 2021. We had significant other acquisition activity in 2021 in France.
In March, we acquired Labo Sambourg and Mayo Bio. In April, we acquired Biocéliande. In July, we acquired LLR
Luxembourg, Alphabio, Bio Sites, Viollet-Belmont and Oriade Noviale. In October, we acquired Bio-Santis and Medilys.
In evaluating transactions, we seek to benchmark pricing against prevailing market conditions at the time, while taking into
account the size and strategic significance of any given acquisition. When assessing a potential target, we generally consider
those within a range of applicable EBITDA multiples which depends on the size of the target’s business. With smaller
targets, we pursue acquisitions at lower EBITDA multiples, whereas for larger targets, we would consider paying a higher
EBITDA multiple.

**_Strong, resilient financial performance bolstered by high margins and strong cash flow generation_**

We have a strong track record of growth, with our annual pro forma revenue growth growing over 60% from 2015 to 2019.
From 2019 to 2020, our annual revenue has grown by 111.7% including COVID-19 impact for the year ended December
31, 2020 and 33.1% excluding COVID-19 impact for the year ended December 31, 2020. Even pre-COVID-19, from 2018
to 2019, we have generated organic net sales growth of 2% in France and 3-4% in Belgium from 2010 to 2018, exceeding
that of the overall market (approximately 0.8% from 2014 to 2019 in France and 2-3% from 2010 to 2018 in Belgium),
due in part to our structural exposure to regions exhibiting greater organic growth in testing volumes. More recently, our
French sales have organically grown by over 59% for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the six months
ended June 30, 2020.

Our above-market organic growth trajectory has been supported by our strategy of selectively investing in geographic
regions that exhibit attractive demographic characteristics, such as rapidly growing or aging populations, metropolitan
areas with above-average population density and relative affluence. Within each of the geographic regions we have chosen
to enter, we have built a dense network of collection sites which leverage centralized regional technical platform
capabilities to achieve cost savings. Our scale and infrastructure allow us to achieve economies of scale in negotiating with
suppliers, while allowing us to survey a broad array of best practices which are adopted across the Group.

Our efficient operational approach has allowed us to generate Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact)
of €468.7 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 and a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19
impact) margin of 35.2% during the same time period, which we believe to have outperformed our peers in our core
markets.


-----

Our business has maintained stable margins and cash conversion over a number of years, despite significant growth. Our
Adjusted EBITDA margins were 29.2%, 29.6% and 38.0% for the years ended December 31, 2018 2019 and 2020,
respectively. Our adjusted free cash flow, which we calculate as Adjusted EBITDA less changes in net working capital
and net capital expenditure, was €73.0 million, €166.0 million, €402.3 million and €553.0 million for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. Our cash flow performance
was also strong, with net cash flow from operating activities representing 74% and 65% of our EBITDA for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020 respectively, supported notably by our limited capital expenditures profile and reduced
working capital requirements. Our cash flow conversion ratio, which we calculate as our adjusted free cash flow as a
percentage of Adjusted EBITDA, was 71.6%, 92.2%, 82.2% and 98.5% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and
2020 and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively.

In addition, we typically do not acquire any diagnostic instrumentation (except for PCR testing equipment, which we
purchased in 2020 in response to increasing demand due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic) and lease our
equipment from our reagent suppliers. See “Business—Our Suppliers” for more information. This approach benefits us by
limiting ongoing maintenance capital expenditures.

**_Highly experienced and agile management team with an entrepreneurial spirit supported by committed shareholders_**
**_and investors_**

We have an experienced management team with substantial scientific and commercial experience in the diagnostic testing
sector. Our majority shareholder, Chairman and CEO, Dr. Stéphane Eimer, is a trained pharmacist and medical biologist
who founded Laboratoire Eimer in 1998 and maintains control over our operations.

Our senior leadership and culture (driven by a medical biologist instead of a financial sponsor) distinguishes us from our
competitors. Dr. Eimer’s strategic vision and long and successful track record of consolidation have helped drive our
growth. His knowledge and reputation among other biologists in the industry have historically been an important
differentiator during our M&A processes, compared with certain sponsor-backed peers. Dr. Eimer’s deep and long-standing
relationships with suppliers allow us to benefit from competitive margins under our supply agreements. For more
information about our management, see “Management”. Dr. Eimer’s strategy is also to cultivate strong management teams
at the local level. Our network of regional management teams, incentivized with minority shareholdings in their respective
laboratories, further provide strength and depth of experience at each level of the Group and ensure high quality and
consistency of operational initiatives across our Group. We believe that our corporate infrastructure provides the necessary
framework for improving performance and sharing best practices across our network. Our senior and regional management
structure has allowed us to retain our culture as a scientifically-led organization and promote our reputation as the provider
of choice in the routine outpatient diagnostic testing market in Europe.

Our de-centralized governance structure across our network also allows us to make agile investment decisions, thereby
enabling us to achieve a high rate of successful completed acquisitions. This agility has been recently demonstrated in our
response to the emergence of COVID-19, where our management team ramped up the installation of PCR testing
equipment, securing a cornerstone position in the provision of testing in France and an approximate 20% market share of
all COVID-19 tests in France (public and private) and approximately 35% market share in the private MLT PCR testing
market as of June 30, 2021. We have performed more than 8.9 million PCR tests and 377,000 serological tests for the 6
months ended June 30, 2021, compared to 7.4 million of PCR tests and 821,000 serological tests performed for the year
ended December 31, 2020 and COVID-19 tests revenue accounted for 37.1% of our total sales for the year ended December
30, 2020. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic until September, 2021, we performed a total of more than 18.9
million PCR tests and 1.1 million serology tests for COVID-19 in France (including tests performed by companies acquired
in 2020 prior to their acquisition date), and as of the same date, we had performed 2.3 million PCR tests and 261 thousand
serology tests in Belgium. The charts below show the number of COVID-19 PCR tests performed in France and Belgium,
together with the percentage performed by Biogroup, from May 2020 through September 2021.


-----

. .

Note: (1) The available data on the number of COVID tests performed in Belgium do not detail the share of PCR and antigen tests

Our agility and capacity to monitor opportunities has also been demonstrated by our successful establishment of COVID-
19-testing in London, where we have also become a market leader in private COVID-19 testing with seven sites in operation
as of the end of June 30, 2021.

Moreover, we are supported by blue-chip institutional investors who share the long-term strategic objectives of the
management team and bring substantial experience in operating in the healthcare sector. We maintain regular
communication with our key institutional investors, CDPQ, ICG and Straco, who have approval rights with respect to
external acquisitions and financings that exceed a certain level. See “Principal Shareholders, Investors and Related Party
_Transactions—Key Institutional Investors”._

**Our Strategy**

**_Selectively pursue acquisitions and become a pan-European leader in the medical laboratory testing space_**

We believe we are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in France and in Belgium, operating
in seven regions in France, one region in Belgium, and in six other regions abroad (including the United Kingdom,


-----

Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Brazil). We entered the Spanish and Luxembourg markets through
acquisition in 2021 and believe we are already the second largest laboratory group in Luxembourg based on net sales. The
laboratory testing markets in our markets remain fragmented, and we regularly identify numerous near and medium term
potential consolidation opportunities in both markets. We therefore plan to continue expanding our footprint within all of
these regions through acquisitions and increasing the density of collection sites serving existing and additional technical
platforms, reinforcing our “hub-and-spoke” network model.

We expect acquisitions in the regions in which we are already present to be primarily small- and mid-sized bolt-on
acquisitions that can quickly and effectively be integrated into our existing network infrastructure to realize significant
operating synergies and cost savings at these sites. We will closely appraise potential targets based on their location relative
to our existing facilities, as well as other factors, including customer accessibility. We will prioritize sites that we believe
will help drive testing volume growth for our technical platforms and further increase our market share. We will also
leverage our local medical biologists’ knowledge of the market and their relationships with the management of potential
targets. We aim to finance such bolt-on acquisitions with our organic free cash flow.

We also intend to expand into new regions in our markets, particularly in the latest geographies we have established, i.e.
in Spain and to a lesser extent in Luxembourg, which fit specific demographic criteria that we believe will drive increasing
testing volumes, such as regions with rapidly growing or aging populations, metropolitan areas with above-average
population density and relative affluence. Acquisitions in new regions are likely to focus on mid-sized to larger targets that
we believe will provide us with sufficient scale and both local collection sites and technical platforms. Once such
acquisitions are completed and our operations are integrated, we may seek to further consolidate our position and enhance
network density through smaller bolt-on acquisitions.

Moreover, we continue to selectively assess potential acquisition opportunities in other European markets which we believe
present attractive demographic characteristics and opportunities to become a pan-European leading laboratory testing
provider by leveraging our experience in our core markets. Acquisitions in new markets are likely to be mid- to large-size
transactions.

**_Drive organic volume growth across our markets and raise brand recognition_**

Our goal is to continue delivering organic growth superior to the growth of the markets in which we operate. We intend to
achieve this through our continued focus on operational excellence and improved customer experience and satisfaction. In
particular, we believe that the continued development of our established laboratory network will further foster successful
organic growth and help us to maintain and expand on the established relationships we hold with key stakeholders across
the industry.

We continue to monitor our geographic footprint closely to ensure that our portfolio is distributed in accordance with our
strategic criteria. Areas of higher density, aging population and affluence will be targeted for greater investment and
improvement, with a particular focus on sites offering enhanced customer convenience and other characteristics that will
help continue to drive volume growth.

We further intend to remain alert to changing trends in testing patterns and ready to respond quickly where these trends are
identified. We remain open to the selective expansion of our testing portfolio within our wider strategy of maintaining a
primary focus on routine B2C testing. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, there is potential for a step-change in public
attitudes toward diagnostic testing and, as demonstrated by our initial reaction to the emergence of the virus, we are able
to respond quickly as these trends are identified to ensure that we continue to provide a comprehensive end-to-end
diagnostic testing service.

Finally, our profile has increased significantly as a result of our COVID-19 testing response and we plan to use this as a
platform to further develop customer awareness, establish solid branding and reputation and promote public understanding
of us and our service offering to drive additional B2C volumes.


-----

**_Continue to deliver operating efficiencies and maintain best-in-class margins_**

We will continue to maintain our established growth trajectory in line with our historical acquisitions and leverage the
economies of scale that historical and future acquisitions can deliver. Our scale is our core differentiator in our core markets
and the source of our primary competitive advantage over smaller peers. Our size allows us to benefit from operational and
supply chain efficiencies and to survey a broad landscape for best practices, which we can then benchmark and adopt across
our network. Our market leadership and culture (driven by a medical biologist controlling ownership instead of a financial
investor) also helps us attract and retain high quality staff and serves as a competitive differentiator in M&A processes.

We will continue to enhance our internal logistical and procurement networks and aim to operate as efficiently as possible
in the delivery of our services. Our strategy is to use a limited number of suppliers per service and type of purchase for the
Group. This selection process allows us to choose the best supplier for each type of analysis and to obtain optimized
purchasing conditions through economies of scale. Our procurement partner framework agreements will be revisited from
time to time to ensure they continue bringing the best value for our Group as we continue to grow in scale, and our logistical
arrangements will respond to the increasing scope of our network to ensure that our operating and financial performance
is maintained.

We will continue our strategy of maximizing our operational efficiency, through our dense networks of collection sites
located in close proximity to technical platforms, which enable us to centralize our testing equipment and professionals at
technical platforms, reduce our overhead costs and, consequently, maintain our high EBITDA margin. Moreover, we will
maintain our focus on providing customers with convenience in terms of proximity to our collection sites, fast and accurate
testing results (we estimate that we revert with test results within 12 hours for a majority of tests) and flexible opening
hours. We will also continue to minimize our logistics costs through our hub-and-spoke model, which enables us to achieve
quick turnaround of testing results.

Although we anticipate our net sales to experience downward pressure in the near term as a result of regulatory pricing
pressure in our markets, we have a long track record and significant experience in managing pricing pressure and we remain
confident that our above-market organic volume growth trajectory and consistent operating cost control will continue to
mitigate this to deliver stable or near-stable EBITDA margins and free cash flow in the short to medium term. By leveraging
our dense network, strategically placed in metropolitan areas with higher demand for medical testing due to their
demographics, we expect to sustain sufficient volume growth with low staff costs, allowing us to resist against pricing
pressure in the future.

In line with our historical acquisitions, we will focus on adding scale without reducing post-synergy and cost savings
EBITDA margins for future acquisitions. We will aim to maintain a track record of meeting or exceeding forecast synergies
and cost savings with our future acquisitions, by implementing agile integration strategies and adopting efficiency measures
between the first day of integration and within a few weeks from closing.

**_Encourage the sharing of best practices internally to provide the highest quality service_**

As one of the market-leading providers of testing services, we have developed a reputation for operational excellence. One
of our key differentiators is that our ownership and management structure fosters our culture as a scientifically-led
organization that promotes the sharing of best practices within our Group. Our corporate infrastructure provides the
necessary framework for sharing best practices across our network, through “best practice” committees organized by topic
and supervised by our Quality department, to ensure such practices are benchmarked and adopted across our network. In
so doing, we aim to uniformly promote new investments in technologies and logistical innovation.

We constantly monitor and aim to improve our systems and processes, and plan to develop and upgrade our operating and
diagnostic systems to maintain high quality standards and deliver increased operational excellence and efficiency. For
example, we are actively exploring how increased automation can be incorporated into the end-to-end testing process and,
through our “best practice” committees, we plan to establish, benchmark and then implement new operating standards for
roll-out across our Group. These committees are also expected to build on the experience, including in crisis management
and operational optimization, we gained during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that we are best prepared
to respond to other potential challenges in the future. For example, we have benefited from sharing knowledge through


-----

these committees on the best performing PCR testing equipment, as well as brand selection and alternative sourcing options
for reagents, masks and swabs, which has enhanced our ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and other future
pandemics or similar crises.

**Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic**

**_Overview_**

As a leading provider of medical laboratory testing, we believe we provide a vital service to the healthcare systems and
general public in France and Belgium during the COVID-19 pandemic to help fight against the virus.

We are working closely with French, Belgian and other government health authorities to use our PCR and serology testing
capabilities to help combat the virus. We were granted the status of critical national infrastructure in France and Belgium
by their respective governments during various lock-down periods, which allowed all of our key collection sites and
technical platforms to remain open and operational in order for us to meet the demand for our services.

The significant additional net sales from the large volume of PCR and serology tests we have performed since March 2020
in France and Belgium have resulted in strong cash generation and our increased ability to deleverage. For the twelve
months ended June 30, 2021, we generated €1,185 million of Pro Forma net sales from COVID-19-related PCR and
serology tests, accounting for 47% of the Group’s Pro Forma net sales for the same period. This also had a positive impact
on our EBITDA, with our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2021 at €1,046.6 million and 41.6%, respectively, compared to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding
COVID-19 impact) and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding COVID-19 impact) margin of €468.7 million and 35.2%
for the same period. See “Summary—Other Financial Data” for more information.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, market growth in COVID-19-related tests has significantly
counterbalanced the negative impact of the temporary decrease in volumes of other routine testing. The European private
medical lab testing industry has proven its resilience, and we are currently seeing a gradual return to normal levels of
activity in the routine testing market. We are optimistic that, in the medium to long term, the easing of population
confinement measures and the return of normal economic activity in France and Belgium will result in our business fully
returning to its normal levels. Moreover, the Current Triennial Plan by the French government for the period between 2020
through 2022 provides some market growth and earnings visibility until December 2022. In Belgium, we expect the
government budget allocated to clinical biology medical testing expenditures will increase as a result of an increase in the
Fixed Sum of the medical test price by 1% and an increase in the variable portion of the medical test price calculated with
B-Value by 0.8% in 2021 compared to those budgets for 2020. The exact allocation between the private medical laboratory
testing market and the public market to be published and implemented at a later date. See “Industry” for more information
on Fixed Sum and B-Value.

Since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, Biogroup has performed approximately 18.9 million PCR tests in France and
approximately 2.6 million PCR and serological tests in Belgium, representing approximately 20% of the French national
capacity (or approximately 35% of market share in private medical lab PCR testing) and 12-15% of the Belgian national
capacity of PCR testing market in 2020. We believe we benefit from higher installed capacity compared with our
competitors and an advantageous geographical footprint in and near areas where some of the largest epidemic clusters have
occurred in our markets. In France, we also benefited from higher visibility due to our fast installations of drive-in locations
and good media coverage. Additionally, thanks to our competitive hub-and-spoke network, we are able to provide a
significant proportion of PCR test results in less than 12 hours. In Belgium, we continue to hold our historical leading
position in Flanders (an estimated 26% share of the private testing market for the year ended December 31, 2020) and
benefit from high loyalty from medical practitioners.

In addition, in 2020, LLR Luxembourg was the first lab company chosen by the Luxembourg government to carry out
COVID-19 PCR tests there.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, it is not possible to accurately predict the near-, medium- or long-term impact
of COVID-19 on our business and our industry, the timing and the extent, if any, of the changes in policies on


-----

reimbursement of COVID-19 tests and government policies in connection with the testing requirements for employees for
COVID-19 requiring proof of a negative test or vaccination to carry on certain activities remain uncertain. See “Risks
_Related to Our Industry—The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has caused severe disruptions in_
_the global economy and financial markets which could adversely affect our business”. We will continue monitoring and_
working closely with the authorities as necessary as the COVID-19 pandemic develops. See “Business – Impact of the
_COVID-19 Pandemic” for our PCR and serology testing capabilities, related reimbursement policies in our markets and_
our other COVID-19 pandemic-related initiatives.

**_PCR and serology testing capabilities_**

We believe we have the largest PCR testing capacity in France and Belgium as of the date of this offering memorandum.

From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic until September, 2021, we performed a total of more than 18.9 million
PCR tests and 1.1 million serology tests for COVID-19 in France (including tests performed by companies acquired in
2020 prior to their acquisition date), and as of the same date, we had performed 2.3 million PCR tests and 261 thousand
serology tests in Belgium.

We invested in PCR testing equipment in 2020, which allowed us to gain significant testing capacity early on. We have
installed relevant PCR testing capacity in the largest epidemic clusters in France, enabling us to meet the substantial demand
of COVID-19-related testing, in particular with respect to the “second wave” in the Île-de-France and AURA regions,
where Biogroup has a large market share. We have also installed drive-in locations and dedicated testing spaces next to
our labs, which have mostly been allowed by local authorities to organize massive COVID-19 testing and to increase
visibility for new customers in France. In France, patients were originally tested free of charge without a medical
prescription, and we would be paid directly by the French national health insurance. However, as of October 15, 2021, the
French government decided to stop reimbursing PCR testing and comfort antigen tests (except for anyone who has been
vaccinated and certain other limited exceptions).

We are able to utilize our existing equipment for COVID-19-related serology testing. We increased capital expenditure in
2020 in connection with the purchase of additional machines at our principal and secondary technical platforms in order to
perform high volumes of PCR tests while limiting patients’ wait time for results. Our capital expenditure in connection
with our new PCR testing capabilities was approximately €20 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Our costs for
PCR test and serology test included the cost of reagent, logistics costs, other costs (such as additional personal protective
equipment (such as gloves and masks), and staff-related costs (such as temporary hiring and COVID-19 bonuses).

We have experienced a marginal increase in operational expenditures in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly
due to increased logistics costs in connection with the delivery of equipment and reagents during the initial lockdown and
additional protective equipment, as well as an increase in part-time employees for PCR and serology test sample collection
and analysis. We have implemented enhanced on-site safety measures and procedures applicable to our employees and
administrative staffs and expanded existing flexible work policies such as working from home and video conferencing.

**_Reimbursement Policies_**

As of June 30, 2021, our cost of reimbursement per PCR test was €73.59 in France and €40.44 in Belgium. As of June 30,
2021, our cost of reimbursement per serology test was approximately €30 in France and €9.60 in Belgium. While the
French and Belgian governments have reimbursed the testing services provider the costs of PCR tests in full in the past,
their reimbursement policies have since been updated to require certain conditions to be met to qualify for full
reimbursement, and their reimbursement policies may further change from time to time. For example, as of December 15,
2020, PCR testing services providers in France were reimbursed by the government at €73.59 in total if the test results
were provided within 12 hours from testing. As of October 15, 2021 PCR tests in France are notably reimbursed for
vaccinated people or people with prescriptions at €43.89 per test and at €50.64 per test if results are provided within 12
hours. Moreover, as of October 15, 2021, the French government decided to stop reimbursing PCR testing and so-called
“comfort” antigen tests for anyone who was unvaccinated subject to certain limited exceptions. The price for antigenic
tests is fixed at €22 per test. In Belgium if conditions for reimbursement by the government (including a prescription) are
met, the price per PCR test that the lab receives varies between €44.04 and €47.18 per test (depending on the reasons to


-----

perform the test). Between June and September, there was a temporary extra fee of €10 for the collection by medical staff,
but that ended on 30 September 2021. Any further changes in the policies that may reduce the demand or volume of the
COVID-19-related tests would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
cash flows and prospects. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry—The current outbreak of the novel
_coronavirus, or COVID-19, has caused severe disruptions in the global economy and financial markets which could_
_adversely affect our business.”_

**Our Corporate Structure (SEL/SELAS)**

As of September 30, 2021, Holdco is an SAS incorporated under French law that holds 10.87% of the share capital, 10.88%
of the voting rights and 88.98% of the financial rights of Laboratoire Eimer.

Dr. Stéphane Eimer, our founder and a medical biologist, together with his child, holds (i) 100% of the share capital, voting
rights and financial rights of Holdco; (ii) 100% of the share capital, voting rights and financial rights of SE Finance; and
(iii) directly and indirectly through SE Finance (and excluding the holdings held by Dr Eimer and his child through Holdco),
and together with Dr. Eimer’s spouse’s direct shareholding, 82.55% of the share capital, 82.63% of the voting rights and
6.29% of the financial rights of Laboratoire Eimer. As a result, Dr. Eimer and his family members hold most of the voting
rights, directly or through Holdco and SE Finance, in Laboratoire Eimer, while in-house medical biologists and other
minority shareholders hold the remaining shareholding in Laboratoire Eimer. For more information on financial rights,
voting rights, the share capital structure of our Group and our shareholders, see “Principal Shareholders, Investors and
_Related Party Transactions” and “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure”._ Upon conversion and redemption of all
bonds redeemable into preferred shares of Holdco outstanding and held by our investors as of the date of this offering
memorandum, Dr. Eimer, together with his family members and through SE Finance, would hold 52.33% of the share
capital and voting rights and 42.70% of the financial rights of Holdco (with the remainder of the share capital, voting rights
and financial rights of Holdco held by our institutional investors), and would hold 88.25% of the share capital and 88.33%
of the voting rights and 44.28% of the financial rights of Laboratoire Eimer.

Laboratoire Eimer, which is incorporated as a SELAS under French law, owns 99.97% of the share capital, 49.99% of the
voting rights and 99.99% of financial rights in CAB, with the remainder being held by medical biologists and other minority
shareholders. Certain members of senior management may also invest in CAB pursuant to the existing, or any future,
management incentive plan. See “Management” for more information.

We primarily conduct our business through our subsidiaries in France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain, which we own
through CAB, which is incorporated as a SELAS under French law. Our laboratory companies in France are subject to
ownership restrictions under the relevant French law. French law limits persons who are not medical biologists and entities
that are not laboratory companies from holding, in aggregate, more than 25% of a laboratory company’s share capital and
voting rights. Moreover, external medical biologist and entities that are laboratory companies cannot hold, in aggregate,
more than 49.99% of the share capital and 49.99% of the voting rights in a laboratory company, unless they are incorporated
as “5.1” laboratory companies pursuant to an exception. “5.1” laboratory companies in France (including CAB and certain
subsidiaries of our Group) are allowed to have (i) external medical biologist and entities that are laboratory companies to
hold, in aggregate, up to 99.99% of the share capital and 49.99% of the voting rights in such laboratory company and (ii)
transfers of the securities of such laboratory company to be subject to a legal right of first refusal from the in-house medical
biologists. Officers of French laboratory companies must be in-house medical biologists and at least two-thirds of the
members of an executive board or a supervisory board of French laboratory companies must be practicing in-house medical
biologists. French law also requires that medical laboratories must take the corporate form of a SEL (unless they are
organized as a non-profit organization, or a société civile professionnelle (“SCP”), a cooperative undertaking or operated
by an individual). As a result, although practicing medical biologists typically own less than 10% of the financial rights in
our respective laboratories (except in certain situations where founders still have significant stakes), they always hold at
least 50.01% of the voting rights. Moreover, medical biologists must, under French law, be allowed to exercise their
independent judgment in the conduct of their day-to-day operations. For more information on the regulations affecting the
corporate form and ownership of French medical laboratories, see “Regulation—France—Laboratory Ownership and
_Corporate Structure.”_


-----

As a result, we do not have de jure control over our French subsidiaries and we are dependent on the consents from the
medical biologists who hold the majority of the voting rights in, and those that are officers entitled to act on behalf of, our
French subsidiaries, for decisions affecting these laboratory subsidiaries’ operations. However, our existing shareholders
agreement, bylaws and articles of associations with each of our laboratory companies allow us to implement key
management decisions decided at the Group level, while maintaining the independence of our medical biologists for day-
to-day operational decisions in compliance with French law. Pursuant to the respective bylaws, main shareholders of each
company of the Group are entitled to receive from the representative of such company prior notice of all major operating
decisions of our laboratory companies, including the incurrence of debt over a specified threshold, corporate mergers,
yearly budgeting, entering into contracts with a term over one year or a value greater than a specified amount. In case there
is a disagreement among our local management and our Group management in relation to major operating decisions, we
are entitled to subject such decisions to a shareholder vote. As we hold a significant (though non-controlling) stake in the
voting rights of our laboratory subsidiaries, we believe that we are able to secure a majority with the support from a portion
of in-house medical biologists to ensure that key management decisions decided by the Group management are accepted,
or operating decisions that are not seen as favorable to the Group are not adopted. As of the date of this offering
memorandum, we have not experienced any disagreement with local management or officers with respect to
implementation of the Group’s strategy and decisions and we have not exercised our shareholder rights in such context.
We enter into a similar shareholders agreement with each of our newly acquired laboratory company. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to Our Business—We may not exercise full control over the operations of our French subsidiaries in which_
_we have a minority voting interest, including the Issuer, and are dependent on the biologists who own a majority voting_
_interest in them to conduct the operations of such subsidiaries.”_

Regulatory restrictions on the ownership of our subsidiaries in Belgium are much less stringent than those imposed by
French law. We operate our business in Belgium through subsidiaries fully owned directly and indirectly through CAB.

We believe that we are in compliance with all regulatory structuring requirements. However, regulations are subject to
change and we could incur significant expense if a regulatory authority were to take issue with our structure. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry –_ _We operate in a highly regulated sector. Compliance with regulations applicable_
_to our activities may increase our costs or restrict our activities. Failure to comply with such regulations may lead to_
_penalties of various types. Future alterations to regulations applicable to us may have a material adverse impact on our_
_activities.”_

**Our Business**

**_Overview_**

We provide medical laboratory testing services primarily in France and Belgium. Our business mainly consists of routine
medical laboratory testing operations that are performed in-house for patients in France and doctors or patients in Belgium
and a small portion of specialized tests that are either conducted in-house or outsourced. Since the outbreak of the COVID-
19 pandemic, we have also started providing COVID-19-related PCR and serology testing services primarily in France and
Belgium. See “—Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic” for more information on the operation and financial impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on our business.

We are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in France and Belgium. For the six months
ended June 30, 2021, we generated net sales of €1,174.5, including net sales of €1,021.4 in France and €141.1 net sales in
Belgium through Medina Group, which we acquired in October 2020.

We perform tests in-house that are either prescribed by doctors and medical institutions in connection with general patient
care to establish or support a diagnosis, to monitor treatment, to search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition or to prevent
a disease, or requested by the patients who elect to get tested for certain non-prescribed medical tests. The types of tests
we perform to date include:

      - _Clinical biochemistry and chemistry testing, for analysis of bodily fluid samples;_

      - _Hematology testing, including blood cell counts and analysis, for monitoring during surgery or blood disorders;_


-----

      - _Immunochemistry testing, including analysis of proteins to diagnose immune system such cancer, fertility_
problems, thyroid, anemia and cardiac testing;

      - _Allergy testing, for allergic reactions against various substances;_

      - _Molecular diagnostics and molecular biology testing, which involve gene-based tests for purposes of the early_
detection and monitoring of, and therapy selection for, infectious diseases;

      - _Microbiology testing, including for identification of infection-causing bacteria and detection of emerging_
antimicrobial resistance;

      - _Cytology and pathology testing, for detection, analysis and typing of cancer;_

      - _Infertility diagnosis, for testing of fertility of patients;_

      - _Artificial intrauterine insemination, for infertility treatment (including both in vitro fertilization and assisted_
reproduction);

      - _Non-invasive prenatal testing, for determination of genetic abnormalities of the fetus;_

      - _Screening for fetal trisomy, for genetic screening of fetuses;_

      - _Immunohematology, including pretransfusion and prenatal tests;_

      - _Tumor marker testing, for identification of substances in the blood, urine, or tissues as cancer screening;_

      - _Hormonology, for testing of hormone levels;_

      - _Specialized hemostasis, for screening of coagulation defects; and_

      - _Genetics testing, including for identification of mutated genes._

We also plan to invest in new tests by the end of 2021. For example, we initiated tests relating to detecting Down’s
syndrome during the first quarter of pregnancy and detection of helicobacter pylori.

In France, we operate in several regional areas through a combination of multiple collection sites serviced by one or more
technical platforms where tests are actually performed. We believe this hub-and-spoke model provides an efficient use of
our resources. By collecting samples within close proximity to patients’ homes and workplaces, while centralizing testing
equipment and professionals at technical platforms, we are able to reduce equipment and personnel overhead costs
associated with carrying out testing at each collection site. Samples are collected by an internal logistics service (except
for our operations in Ile-de-France, which uses an external logistics services provider) several times a day for analysis, and
transported to one of the technical platforms to be analyzed. See “—Our Logistics”. In Belgium, we operate eight central
testing facilities and collect samples from general practitioners’ offices or, less frequently, from collection centers. By
collecting samples directly from practitioners, who typically also collect samples themselves, rather than from other
facilities, we are able to limit recurring costs in connection with sample collection and maximize efficiency. While we
perform most of our tests exclusively in-house through our technical platforms equipped with advanced testing technology,
we outsource a small portion of specialized tests with low demand (and where it is less profitable to invest in resources to
conduct the tests in-house), mostly in France where we outsource to our outsourcing partners, pursuant to a long-term
outsourcing framework agreement. We re-evaluate our outsourcing policy from time to time in light of demand for the
tests we outsource. If we conclude that a test that we outsource becomes sufficiently recurrent, or there is an increase in
demand for such a test, we may decide to make an investment and purchase or lease the necessary equipment and hire the
appropriate staff to be able to perform the test in-house. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 2% of our tests in France
(in terms of volume) are outsourced. In Belgium, we similarly outsource only a small percentage of our tests, typically to
university laboratories. We try to minimize the quantity of outsourced tests because, under Belgian law, we are responsible


-----

for 100% of the B-Value attributed to the test while we are only able to recover 25% of the B-Value. For a limited time
period during the initial lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had to outsource a small portion of our
COVID-19 testing in Belgium to certain hospitals, due to the limited availability of testing equipment and reagents. For
COVID-19 tests, the above-mentioned law on partial reimbursement was disapplied.

When we acquire a company that offers outsourced tests that we believe are not sufficiently profitable, the relevant
outsourcing contracts are either terminated immediately or soon after closing and replaced with an extension of our master
agreement with our outsourcing partners, or renegotiated to align the prices and conditions offered by the acquired
company’s outsourcing partner with our standard outsourcing arrangements (usually immediately after closing).

We also provide medical lab tests requested by local clinics for a limited range of tests and provide emergency testing
assistance via our local technical platforms. In Belgium, we serve as an outsourcing party for certain other laboratories and
hospitals.

Our business is highly regulated in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including in terms of pricing for our
services. See “Industry” and “Regulation”.

**_Testing_**

We have made considerable investments in our testing capacity in order to have additional capacity to integrate new
laboratories into our existing testing infrastructure. As a result, we sustain a high utilization rate of our technical platforms
while maintaining sufficient back-up capacity as part of our contingency planning, in case we experience any technical
problems or disruptions in our operations.

Testing is generally organized into three phases: (i) the pre-analytical phase, which includes collecting samples and
transporting them to technical platforms, (ii) the analytical phase, during which the actual test is performed, and (iii) the
post-analytical phase, where results are delivered to the patient and/or prescribing doctor physically or digitally.

      - _Pre-analytical phase. Before medical testing is performed, samples are collected from the patient, identified and_
delivered to our technical platforms for analysis. In France, patient samples are collected directly by the collection
sites, although in more remote areas, samples are collected by nurses who then submit samples to the technical
platforms. In Belgium, samples are primarily collected at doctors’ offices and transported to our technical
platforms for testing.

      - _Analytical phase. Once we have logged in the test request and collected the samples, we perform the necessary_
tests. Most of the tests we perform are automated, while others must be performed manually by our medical
biologists or technicians. We perform most of our tests internally through a technical platform that centralizes
tests for several collection sites. During the analytical phase, we outsource a small portion of our specialized tests
(approximately 2% of our total tests by volume) that are less recurrent to external specialty testing provider.

      - _Post-analytical phase. Our medical biologists analyze the test results once they become available._ A majority of
our testing is completed within 12 hours. Results are transmitted either in hard copy or made available
electronically to patients and/or doctors over the internet.

**_Our Operations_**

We have or are pursuing operations in key regions across five key countries in Europe, which are France, Belgium, the
United Kingdom, Luxembourg and Spain. The maps set forth below present our existing footprint in the regions we operate
and footprint of the companies of whose acquisitions will be funded with the proceeds from this Offering.


-----

_France_

We are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in France, based on our net sales in 2019. We
owned the largest network of laboratories in France, with 830 collection sites across seven regions as of September 30,
2021. We also have an extensive regional footprint, with a high number of collection sites in each region in which we
operate. According to the industry report, which categorized our operating regions into a total of 11 regions in France, we
had an average of 65 collection sites per region in 2019, as compared to a competitor average of 30 and as of the date of
the offering memorandum we had 75 collection sites per region.

Our Group is structured in dense networks of collection points located in close proximity to state-of-the-art and well-
invested technical platform hubs. We believe that our average number of 24 sites per technical platform is very competitive
compared to the market average and allows us to optimize utilization of technical platforms and achieve cost savings.

Medical doctors in France are prohibited by law from conducting laboratory tests themselves. As a result, patients who are
prescribed with medical tests or elect to get tested for non-prescribed tests are required to find a walk-in laboratory or
arrange for a nurse or technician to collect a sample from their home. Patients who travel to a laboratory to have their
samples taken for testing typically choose a laboratory close to their place of residence, workplace or transport hub due to
convenience. We have accordingly made, and will continue to make, selective acquisitions of collection sites in the
respective regions targeted to maximize the number of visitations and testing. Each of our collection sites in France has
on-site medical biologists as required by law. Samples collected are then sent to one of our nearest regional technical
platforms for testing (or in the case of a small portion of specialized tests with low demand, are sent to our outsourcing
partner).

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we conducted tests for approximately 36.8 million files (created based on
visitation of patients) in France or approximately 144.7 thousand files per working day.

Our business in France generated €1,021.4 of net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2021, representing 87% of our
total net sales for the same period.

_Belgium_

In October 2020, we acquired the Medina Group (a total of eight laboratories) to expand our operations to the Belgian
laboratory testing market. We are the leading private medical laboratory services company by net sales in Belgium, based
on our net sales in 2019. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we own 32 collection sites in the Flanders region
served by eight technical platforms, performing analyses for public hospitals, doctors and patients. As of June 30, 2021,
our Belgian business has operated almost exclusively in the Flanders region, while also serving a few general practitioners
in the Brussels and Walloon regions. The LLR Belgique Acquisition, for which a letter of intent was signed in August
2021, is designed to increase our presence in the Brussels and Walloon regions and provide us with a market leading
footprint.

We believe that there are several small- to mid-sized independent laboratory groups in Belgium that could represent growth
opportunities for us, both in Flanders and in other regions in Belgium from time to time.


-----

Our laboratories in Belgium offer a broad range of medical lab tests. The samples are collected at the collection sites that
we operate or at doctors’ offices, and sent to our regional technical platforms for testing.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we conducted medical lab tests for approximately 4.8 million files (created
based on visitation of patients) in Belgium, or approximately 18.8 thousand per working day.

Our business in Belgium generated collectively €141.1 of net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

**Our Growth through Acquisitions**

We have grown our business mainly through strategic and bolt-on acquisitions and we expect our acquisition strategy to
continue to be an important driver of our future growth. We are a leading consolidator in the European medical laboratory
services market with a significant number of acquisitions completed to date and a demonstrated ability to extract. Since
January 1, 2015, we have completed 57 acquisitions of laboratory groups. As of December 31, 2020, we believe we owned
the largest network of laboratories in France and one of the largest networks of laboratories in Belgium. See _“—Our_
_History” for more information on our previous acquisitions._

Our goal is to build a dense network of collection sites around each technical platform in order to optimize the utilization
of our technical platforms and therefore maximize synergies and cost savings. Our acquisition strategy is two-fold: when
we enter a new market, we establish a leading position in a targeted region by making a strategic acquisition of technical
platforms together with multiple collection sites, followed by smaller bolt-on acquisitions. Acquisitions in the regions in
which we are already present are primarily small- and mid-sized bolt-on acquisitions that can quickly and effectively be
integrated into our existing network infrastructure to realize significant operating synergies and cost savings at these sites.
We will closely appraise potential targets based on their location relative to our existing facilities, as well as other factors,
including customer accessibility. We will prioritize sites that we believe will help drive testing volume growth for our
technical platforms and further increase our market share. We will also leverage our local medical biologists’ knowledge
of the market and their relationships with the management of potential targets.

We have an agile investment decision-making process which enables us to achieve a high rate of converting selected targets
into completed acquisitions. Our investment decisions are made primarily by a small team of senior management led by
our chief executive officer Stéphane Eimer, which is supported by a dedicated team of financial and legal advisors that
have extensive experience assisting us with our acquisition projects. We screen a limited number of potential targets and
focus on regions where we are already present to leverage our market knowledge gained from our medical biologists
working in the relevant region and their relationship with management of the potential target. We also from time to time
target significant businesses in order to expand into a region where we are not present, provided that the target has a leading
position and can serve as a consolidation platform. Key criteria for our acquisition decision are (i) we must own at least a
certain percentage of financial rights in the target post-closing, (ii) significant growth potential in the region, (iii) potential
to align EBITDA margin of the target with our existing EBITDA margin and (iv) expected synergies and cost savings with
our existing technical platform and network of collection sites.

Once we identify a target, we enter into a preliminary analysis phase, during which we review supply contracts, conduct a
financial analysis in order to determine synergy opportunities and conduct a legal analysis. The results of this preliminary
analysis are then submitted for approval by senior management as well as other managers who oversee key business areas
including IT, quality, supply chain, staff planning and human resources. Following approval, we then proceed to the non-
binding offer phase. While in exclusivity with the relevant sellers, we appoint audit and legal professionals to conduct
robust due diligence on the target and negotiate contractual savings with the target’s biologists and/or with external
suppliers to achieve synergies.

We have a successful track record of achieving cost savings and synergies from acquisitions due to our systematic approach
of (i) negotiating contractual savings, such as a decrease in the salaries of the target’s biologists who are otherwise
incentivized by becoming shareholders after the acquisition, (ii) replacing supplier contracts at the target with our master
agreements (or, where possible, renegotiating contracts to align prices with ours) so as to achieve economies of scale
through lower prices and (iii) centralizing testing in one regional technical platform, enabling us to streamline the overall
number of employees or replace a biologist with a lower-cost technician. For example, our acquisitions of Bioesterel in


-----

December 2018 and Biolittoral in June 2019 both resulted in EBITDA margin increases which exceeded our initial target
margin. For the Bioesterel acquisition, we were able to improve Bioesterel’s pre-acquisition EBITDA margin of
approximately 23.4% as of December 2018 for the year ended December 31, 2018 to a post-acquisition EBITDA margin
of 33.4% as of December 2019 for the year ended December 31, 2019, exceeding our initial target EBITDA margin of
31.5% within 13 months. Similarly for the Biolittoral acquisition, we were able to improve Biolittoral’s pre-acquisition
EBITDA margin of approximately 14.1% as of June 2019 to a post-acquisition EBITDA margin of 36.5% as of December
2019 for the six months ended December 31, 2019, exceeding our initial target EBITDA of 35.1% within six months. For
the Laborizon Acquisition, we were able to improve Laborizon’s pre-acquisition EBITDA margin of approximately 23.8%
as of December 31, 2019 to a post-acquisition EBITDA margin of 30.9% excluding COVID-19 impact for the year ended
December 31, 2020, exceeding our initial target EBITDA of 29% within 6 months. We work closely with the target to
implement the cost savings and synergies at or shortly after the acquisition closing, as most of the synergies are composed
of contractual savings that are secured at the time of the signing of the acquisition agreement.

**Quality Standards**

We operate in a highly regulated market with stringent regulations and strict accreditation procedures governing the
granting or the renewal of a license to operate a laboratory and the standards by which any such laboratory is operated. Our
quality assurance efforts mainly focus on reporting accuracy, proficiency testing, process audits and training for all of our
medical biologists and technical staff for all laboratories and collection sites.

The laboratory services industry is subject to national level regulation that sets quality standards for operations. These
standards vary from country to country. See “Regulation”. Biogroup is committed to compliance with all applicable
accreditation and certification standards from governmental regulators such as _Comité_ _français d’accreditation_
(“COFRAC”) in France and _de Belgische Accreditatie-instelling/l’Organisme belge d’Accreditation (“BELAC”) in_
Belgium. Both COFRAC and BELAC are members of several international accreditation recognition organizations,
including the ILAC (International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation), the IAF (“International Accreditation
**Forum”) and the EA (European co-operation for Accreditation). Accreditation by one member of any of these accreditation**
organizations will be recognized by other members. For more detail on the regulatory standards to which our operations
are subject, see “Regulation.”

We track accreditation rate, which measures the number of tests (in volume and as a percentage of the total) carried out at
accredited sites and technical platforms and realized according to strictly defined standards (excluding subcontracting). As
of October 31, 2021, our laboratories and facilities in France were 100% accredited by COFRAC under the ISO 15189
standard, and we aim to obtain accreditation under the ISO 9001 standard by 2023.

To ensure robust quality control throughout the Group, our Quality Committee oversees and monitors all laboratories of
the Group. Dr. Michael Buser, our Quality Director, is a member of COFRAC in France and supervises our laboratories to
ensure they are up–to-date on regulatory requirements. Our facilities are subject to periodic external reviews for quality
assurance. Our facilities in France are subject to inspection by COFRAC every 18 months. Our facilities in Belgium are
also subject to review and inspection for adherence to BELAC norms on a periodic basis. Our Quality Committee includes
a representative from each of our laboratory companies and reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer.

**Our Customers**

Our main customers in France and Luxembourg are patients who require medical tests in connection with the diagnosis,
prevention, monitoring and treatment of different diseases, and in Belgium, doctors who assign such tests to patients.
Generally, doctors, including both general practitioners and specialist physicians, prescribe the relevant tests to their
patients. However, there is also an increasing demand for non-prescribed and voluntary tests from our patients. In Spain,
through our entity Cerba Internacional, we are performing reference tests ranging from routine and complex routine to
specialty for a solid client base of routine labs, insurers, private and public hospitals. Through our entity Analiza, our client
is a private insurer company called Asisa and we are performing routine tests for their clients.

In France, patients choose their laboratory services provider, and proximity is a key deciding factor in that selection, in
addition to customer experience and quick turnaround of test results. In Belgium, general practitioners and specialist


-----

physicians select their laboratory services provider. They will usually coordinate with one designated lab which acts as a
one-stop shop for all of the analyses they need for their patients. As a result the quality of the service, quick turnaround
and the scope of testing the lab provides are important in customer retention in Belgium. As we are paid directly by the
government and the patient and are prohibited from incentivizing the prescribing physicians, they do not have financial
incentive to favor one lab over another.

We believe our laboratories are perceived as convenient and capable of delivering quality test results with a quick
turnaround time, and consequently benefit from strong competitive advantages, especially against any potential new
entrants in the market. The convenience of our laboratories is underpinned by our dense network and the proximity of
available testing locations. We also maintain a close relationship with a network of general practitioners and specialist
physicians in Belgium. In particular, we believe our up-to-date IT systems and user-friendly platforms make our services
easy to access for general practitioners and specialist physicians in Belgium, giving us a competitive advantage. We also
publish newsletters and informational flyers from time to time made available at clinics and engage in prevention
campaigns/provide prevention workshops to the nurses and physicians, such as organizing HIV/AIDS preventative testing
campaigns or national awareness days for the prevention of HPV, to increase the visibility of our services. We have also
started providing testing to companies to facilitate employees returning to work. See “—Impact of the COVID-19
_Pandemic—Other COVID-19 Related Initiatives.”_

**Our Suppliers**

We have established a purchasing committee (which includes a purchasing officer from each laboratory company and is
chaired by our President and Chief Executive Officer) to coordinate and harmonize procurement practices across our
laboratory companies. Except for limited cases, we engage one or two suppliers per service and type of purchase under
respective long-term framework agreements, who then provide the relevant service and/or products nationally to our
collection sites and technical platforms. We believe that this selection process allows us to choose the best supplier for
each type of analysis and provides us with greater bargaining power to negotiate optimized purchasing conditions and
achieve attractive pricing on high quality products through economies of scale. For example, our framework agreements
with our suppliers provide for volume discounts which result in further costs saving with each acquisition that is integrated
into our central framework agreements. All of our laboratory companies utilize a single online platform, KaliLab, for the
procurement of supplies.

Once we have completed an acquisition, reagent supply contracts are either (i) terminated in case the target’s supplier is
not the same as ours and replaced with our master agreement, or (ii) renegotiated, where possible, to align prices with our
more beneficial conditions. We aim to align the reagent costs and sub-contracting costs per group-wide contract conditions
so that the aligned costs can be implemented at the target immediately after the closing of the acquisition. Our consistent
growth in the market through acquisitions has allowed us to increase our ordered volumes and continuously re-negotiate
competitive prices under our master arrangements with our suppliers. We regularly re-negotiate our supplier framework
agreements following an increase in our market share and volumes to ensure they continue bringing the best value for our
Group as we continue to grow in scale.

The primary equipment and material required to conduct our business are testing equipment and reagents, which are both
provided by our reagent suppliers. Our main suppliers are reagent producers (including Roche and Siemens) as well as
specialized laboratories (such as Biomnis). We “lease” the majority of the equipment necessary to conduct our in-house
testing operations, as our reagent suppliers also supply the testing equipment at no upfront cost (except for the PCR testing
equipment which we purchased in 2020 in connection with the increased demand for COVID-19-related tests) under a
single invoice. In other words, the cost of equipment is included in the cost we pay to the reagents. We regularly evaluate
the equipment (analytical systems and robotic, pre and post-analytical devices) used by our collection sites and technical
platforms. As we continue to grow in scale, prices are set from time to time through agreements with volume discounts
which we enter into with our suppliers.


-----

**Our Logistics**

Our internal logistics service includes full-time employee drivers in Belgium and France, the latter of which covers all
regions in which we operate in France except for Ile-de-France and certain regions in western France (where we use
logistics service providers for delivery of test samples).

Our drivers are responsible for ensuring the timely delivery of test samples from collection sites to our network of technical
platforms and collect samples multiple times per day in some cases. In Belgium, our drivers are responsible for picking-up
samples at general practitioners’ or specialists’ offices once or twice a day and delivering them to our network of technical
platforms and thus maintain frequent direct contact with general practitioners’ or specialists’ back office staff. We believe
this helps us maintain the quality and reliability of our service. We primarily lease the vehicles that comprise our logistics
fleet. As part of our collective ESG policy, we started to replace our logistics fleets with electric vehicles in 2020.

Our drivers are trained in the proper handling of samples during collection and transportation, including in the use of
appropriate transport containers, the labelling of containers, the manner in which samples and containers are stored in the
vehicle, the temperature at which samples must be transported and the duration of the journey. Our drivers are trained to
handle biological samples in accordance with best practices and applicable laws and regulations, as mishandling samples
in the collection and transportation process can increase the likelihood of errors in laboratory testing. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to Our Business—Disruption, failure or unsuitable delivery of sample transportation services could_
_adversely affect our business and financial results._

Furthermore, our logistics operations allow us to more easily integrate new acquisitions of laboratories into our existing
operations and network of collection sites, without having to re-negotiate the terms with the external logistics provider.
Our logistics team is also supported by external logistics providers in Ile-de-France where we do not operate our own
logistics activities and in France for the delivery of test samples to specialized laboratories and back to our technical
platform for testing that are outsourced to specialized labs.

**Billing and Payment**

In France, medical laboratory testing expenses are largely covered by public funding with CNAM (70.7% in 2019) or
private insurance (23.8% in 2019), with patient out-of-pocket expenses representing a small proportion of expenses (5.5%
in 2019). In Belgium, medical laboratory testing expenses are largely covered by the national social welfare agency
(between 70% and 100%), with out-of-pocket patient expenses amounting up to 30% of the total price of the medical test,
on average.

Billing for our businesses is a complex process involving several payers. Depending on the billing arrangement and the
applicable law of the country in which we operate, the payer may be a third party responsible for providing health insurance
coverage to patients (such as national public health insurance or a private medical insurance plan), a patient or other party
(such as a hospital, another laboratory or an employer) who has outsourced testing to us, or a combination of these parties.

We generally bill for medical testing services on a fee for service basis. In France, the rates we can legally charge for the
laboratory tests we perform are set by the Ministry of Health (Ministère des Affaires sociales et de la Santé) and CNAM.
Based on the size of the private lab market in the industry report and the proportion of spending in the French private
medical testing market according to “Les dépenses de santé 2020” published by DREES in 2021, approximately 79.1% of
spending in the French medical laboratory testing market in 2020 was financed by the French Health Insurance and the
remainder was covered by private insurance companies (approximately 17.2 %) and by the patient directly out-of-pocket
(approximately 2.2%).

In Belgium, the social security system reimburses approximately between 70% and 100% of the price of the tests performed
by medical biology laboratories, with patients responsible for the remainder. Belgian regulations also permit laboratories
to charge patients a nominal administrative fee on a per patient basis.

In France and Belgium, the patients pay the portion of the fee for which they are responsible (if any) at the time of service
and the remainder is paid to us by a third-party payer (such as CPAM, private health organizations and complementary


-----

private health insurance) generally within 30 days. In France, when the test is covered by the list of tests that are eligible
for reimbursement, the French Health Insurance will cover from 70% up to 100% of the set fee. Fees are covered at 100%
for pregnant women and patients with long-term illnesses. Otherwise the remainder that is not reimbursed by the French
Health Insurance must be paid by the patient out of pocket or by the patient’s private complementary insurance. However,
if the test is not on the list of medical tests that are eligible for reimbursement, the patient must pay the lab administering
the test directly. In Belgium, if a certain test is eligible for government reimbursement, the Belgian Health Insurance will
cover from 70% up to 100% of the price for a test directly to us, with the remainder being paid directly by the patient. We
have the option to also charge an optional supplement fee paid by the patient (typically up to 10%), which is customary for
lab testing operations in Belgium. These supplement fees are never applied to certain categories of patients, for example
widows, orphans, retired patients, disabled patients and patients for whom there would otherwise not be an invoice.

We transfer a patient file for reimbursement to health insurance companies in France and Belgium typically within five
days after the testing results become available, and are reimbursed within 15 days after the submission of the files. We
experienced a temporary delay in submitting patient files due to the COVID-19 pandemic and re-allocation of
administrative personnel to support COVID-19-related testing demand at our collection sites between July and November
2020, which temporarily adversely affected our working capital during that period. Reimbursement cycles have since
returned to normal. For more information on our working capital, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations”._

Although we believe we have no material issues related to collecting fees for our services, we are subject to the risk of
non-payment by patients and other clients. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Financial difficulties of
_certain of our clients or third-party payers may require us to write off debts.” We maintain reserves for doubtful accounts_
and amounts past due.

**Health and Safety and Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG)**

Our business is subject to licensing and other requirements under EU, national and local laws and regulations relating to
the protection of the environment and human and occupational health and safety, including those requirements governing
the handling, transportation and disposal of medical samples and biological, infectious and hazardous waste. All our
facilities are subject to requirements for the disposal of medical samples at authorized facilities and we generally utilize
outside vendors for the disposal of such samples. Nevertheless, we could be held responsible for clean-up of contamination
at such sites attributable to our wastes.

As part of the ISO 15189 standard accreditation, we have identified our main health and safety risks, which are linked to
exposures to blood, chemicals and road accidents for courier deliveries. Each of our laboratories maintains its own risk
directory as required by law, and we track frequency and severity of occupational accidents for monitoring purposes. We
pay a separate bonus to our selected employees on a quarterly basis based on their diligence to discourage absenteeism.

In addition, our business is subject to extensive requirements relating to workplace safety in medical laboratories,
particularly for employees who could be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. These
regulations, among other things, require strict work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical
follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and the transmission of, blood-borne
pathogens.

As a result of the outbreak of COVID-19, we have implemented a series of additional safety measures and procedures to
ensure the health and safety of all of our employees in accordance with applicable regulations. These measures have
included implementing shift systems, including weekends, promoting flexible working arrangements, regular COVID-19
testing of our employees, social distancing (especially in the respective head offices) and wearing masks.

As part of our collective ESG policy, we have set a target to achieve “zero-paper” and have adopted measures to reduce
paper waste from our operations, including encouraging our patients to retrieve their results online. We have also hired an
external service provider to collect and recycle paper and cardboard wastes.


-----

Moreover, we monitor our risks in connection with applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations, including but not
limited to, the French law of December 9, 2016 relating to transparency, fighting corruption and modernizing economic
life (“Sapin II”), and plan to adopt additional measures to enhance compliance across our laboratory network. As part of
ISO 15189 standard accreditation and COFRAC and BELAC certification process, we have established internal protocols
in selection and annual assessment of our suppliers. We updated our code of conduct in January 2021, and are in the process
of developing and deploying a rigorous anti-corruption compliance employee training program.

According to the sustainability report, our performance on health and safety is comparable to our industry peers. Although
we are not aware of any current material non-compliance with our obligations under environmental, health and safety laws
and regulations in connection with our operations, failure to comply with such laws and regulations in the future could
subject us to civil and criminal fines and penalties, remediation costs, enforcement actions, the suspension or termination
of our licenses to operate or third-party claims. See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Industry – _We operate in a highly_
_regulated sector. Compliance with regulations applicable to our activities may increase our costs or restrict our activities._
_Failure to comply with such regulations may lead to penalties of various types. Future alterations to regulations applicable_
_to us may have a material adverse impact on our activities.”_

**Information Technology Systems**

We use information technology systems (or “IT systems”) in virtually all aspects of our business, including medical
laboratory testing, billing, customer service and the management of medical data. The successful delivery of our services
depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems, especially when time is of the essence
for a laboratory test result.

We utilize an automated tracking system and sample picking at the time of delivery, and we manage the collected laboratory
data and test results by utilizing a centralized, in-house developed laboratory information management system, which
connects various operating laboratories, patient and physicians portals, and our other departments such as communication,
account and human resources. As a result, our operational entities have centralized and harmonized access to the relevant
laboratory data and other information about the tests that are offered by our network, including the cost of the relevant
medical tests, and facilitates the prompt return of testing results. Patients and physicians portals also allow us to attract new
customers and receive and track customer feedback efficiently.

We operate two main IT systems teams to oversee our IT systems-related operations: our applications development team,
which engages in application development and maintenance of our core IT systems, and our operations team, which is in
charge of infrastructure management and maintenance, such as networks equipment, servers, telephony, IT security and
monitoring.

Our IT systems are hosted in several data centers, not centralised to prevent from impacting every structure at the same
time in case of problem. Our collection sites and technical platforms are connected to data centers through a multiprotocol
label switching network, which are provided by Telenet (as a network telecom provider) and Symac (for network equipment
and related maintenance). The underlying network is protected via firewalls for public network access, which we expect to
further update in 2021. Our backup system has a 10 day retention period. Backup is encrypted, unalterable and indelible
even by the administrator; any modification must be validated by both the administrator and the supervisor. We outsource
backups in a datacenter every night. Our workstations are protected by Endpoint Detection and Response (broad context
detection, event search, automated response, and host isolation). All emails are filtered by an anti-phishing, anti-spam, anti-
malware, anti-spear phishing predictive AI technology system. To access data, there are multi-factor authentification on
Microsoft Tenant and security tools.

We understand that security is essential to our operations, and we aim to maintain appropriate technical and organizational
security measures across the network in order to ensure the security of our patients’ data and to prevent cybersecurity
incidents. In particular, we maintain internal procedures for data management in compliance with the latest regulations,
protection of sensitive and medical data (in terms of classification, data breach identification and resolution, identity
verification prior to accessing medical data) and protection of personal data, including in connection with GDPR. In order
to comply with the requirements under GDPR, we have implemented several measures, such as the following: (i) appointed
a data protection officer; (ii) established records of processing activities; (iii) implemented information notices to data


-----

subjects and procedures to handle data subjects’ access requests; and (iv) reviewed and amended data processing
agreements entered into with third-party providers where such providers were involved in the processing of personal data.
Our processes have been recently been updated to allow the accurate and rapid integration of new acquisitions. As of the
date of this offering memorandum we have no ongoing disputes, complaints or proceedings in relation to the processing of
personal data.

We conduct periodic monitoring and network partitioning, and have implemented various prevention measures (such as
logs tracking and automated vulnerabilities detection). In collaboration with our human resources department, we conduct
periodic reviews of VPNs and access logs to monitor user access to sensitive information on our server. We also limit
access to server rooms to authorized personnel only, which are secured by door codes and security cameras. If a breach is
identified, our internal procedures allow our operations to react quickly and implement appropriate resolutions. Supported
by our detailed business continuity plan and data recovery plan, we continue assessing our infrastructure equipment and
network system to ensure sufficient backup, duplicated systems and redundant equipment are in place, including in case of
a disaster or any other unforeseen interruptions.

We also perform penetration tests and security audits on a regular basis to simulate cyberattacks and identify any potential
vulnerabilities in our IT systems. As of the date of this offering memorandum, no major security breaches or vulnerabilities
have been identified based on our latest penetration test.

We have implemented, and will continue to implement, various cybersecurity improvement programs across our laboratory
network. For example, we organize cybersecurity awareness programs and training campaigns on the relevant ISO
standards every one to two years, with the latest held in 2020. We are currently in the process of implementing a continuous
improvement initiative to improve the performance and efficiency of our network. We have also appointed a Chief
Information Security Officer (“CISO”) in August 2020 to supervise our cybersecurity roadmap and improvement plan.

Historically, we have grown through acquisitions and as part of our integrated business model, and to maintain the quality
of our IT system and relevant staff members, we ensure that our IT supply contracts are implemented at the target and that
our IT systems are integrated in a short timeframe following closing.

**Facilities**

Our facilities consist primarily of collection sites, technical platforms and office space for the employees. As of the date of
this offering memorandum, we had approximately 830 collection sites and 34 principal technical platforms in France, 32
collection sites and 2 principal technical platforms in Belgium, and 729 collection sites and 41 technical platforms in the
rest of Europe. We rent the majority of our premises pursuant to commercial leases, which are long-term leases subject to
tacit renewal (tacite prolongation). In addition, for certain COVID-19-related testing, we have expanded our operations to
temporary dedicated testing premises which are provided by the relevant owners for free (such as at schools that are located
near our collection sites). We believe that our facilities are generally adequate for our present needs and that suitable
additional or replacement space would be available to the extent required. Our headquarter office is located in Saint Denis,
France.

**Employees**

As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 8,986 full-time equivalent employees. Our operation was also supported by
non-salaried medical biologists. We hire mostly full-time employees but because of COVID-19; we have hired part-time
employees to help with our increased workload and provide necessary working flexibility during the crisis.

In our markets, we are subject to collective bargaining agreements negotiated between unions and employers’
representatives at the national level and made mandatory pursuant to national labor law. Following an acquisition, medical
biologists employed by the target company tend to continue working within the Group to avoid triggering the non-compete
clauses in their employment contracts. The turnover of employees within the Group varies depending on the region, and
we believe it is comparable to turnover in other industries and to that of our competitors. Our employees in France benefit
from profit sharing agreements (which mandatory under French law), which incentivize their involvement and retention in
the Group.


-----

While we have not experienced any material labor disputes within the last three years, we may experience labor disputes
that could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs. See “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to our Business – Labor
_disputes could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs.”_

For the year ended December 31, 2020, our payroll and related expenses amounted to €366.5 million.

**Intellectual Property**

Generally, we do not regard intellectual property to be a material part of our assets or essential to our operations. Besides
intellectual property protections on our business and trade names, we do not hold any material intellectual property assets.

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance, both on the Group as a whole, and at each individual laboratory we own, against various risks
related to our business and operations, including mandatory professional civil liability (for which amendments are made
from time to time for laboratories conducting specific activities within the scope of our business, such as tests related to
fertility treatments or prenatal diagnosis), fire insurance combined property damage and, in respect of certain of our
laboratories, business interruption policies. We have taken out directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for executives
within our Group. We also maintain applicable compulsory workers’ compensation and motor liability coverage. We also
maintain general excess liability policies that provide coverage in situation where the limit under the applicable primary
policy is insufficient to satisfy the claim.

We believe that our existing insurance policies are adequate in terms of both amounts covered and conditions of coverage
to cover the major risks of our business, taking into account the cost of insurance coverage and the potential risks to
business operations. However, there can be no assurance that no losses will be incurred or that this coverage will be
sufficient to cover the cost of defense or damages in the event of a significant claim. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_Our Business—We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance.”_

**Legal Proceedings**

We have been involved, and may be involved in the future, in various legal or governmental proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business, including disputes concerning our acquisitions, professional liability and employee-related
matters, regulatory matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and health insurance carriers regarding, among
other things, billing issues. Because we operate in a regulated industry, we are, in the ordinary course of business, subject
to national and local regulatory scrutiny, supervision and controls. For more information on the regulations governing our
business, see “Regulation.”

**_CBM25_**

On July 7, 2019, SPFPL Widmer (which was subsequently merged into CAB) acquired shares in CBM25 from 12 biologists
(or their personal holding vehicles) (the “CBM25 Sellers”) for consideration of €71.9 million (the “CBM25
**Consideration”). On December 19, 2019, at the request of LBI Développement, the Tribunal de Grande Instance of**
Besançon found that the acquisition had breached the pre-emption right of LBI Développement that arose from an
affiliation agreement dated September 1, 2016 entered into between CBM25 and LBI Développement (the “Affiliation
**Agreement”) and annulled the acquisition. SPFPL Widmer and the CBM25 Sellers initially appealed this decision, but in**
May 2020, in compliance with this judgment, SPFPL Widmer reassigned the shares of CBM25 back to the CBM25 Sellers.
CAB and the CBM25 Sellers subsequently signed a second sale and purchase agreement dated May 14, 2020 (the “Second
**SPA”) and relaunched the pre-emption procedure vis-à-vis LBI Développement in accordance with the Affiliation**
Agreement.

On November 24, 2020, the Tribunal Judiciaire of Besançon ordered the suspension of the time limit for LBI
Développement to pre-empt pending the disclosure of certain information. None of the Biogroup companies are parties to
this second litigation. On June 1, 2021, the Court of Appeals of Besançon reversed the judgment delivered on November
24, 2020 by the Tribunal Judiciaire of Besançon and rejected all LBI Développement requests (including the


-----

communication of financial and legal information about CBM25, damages and suspension of time limit for exercising its
pre-emption right). LBI has appealed the decision of the Court of Appeals, which is pending before the French Supreme
Court (Cour de cassation).

Further to this second litigation, CAB decided to let the Second SPA lapse on December 1, 2020, and on December 4,
2020, the CBM25 Sellers notified LBI Développement that they no longer intend to sell the CBM25 shares (the “December
**2020 Notice”). Instead, CAB offered under a put option agreement to, once the Affiliation Agreement has lapsed (which**
occurred on September 30, 2021), acquire the CBM25 shares from the CBM25 Sellers for an amount of €71.9 million. The
CBM25 Sellers, as the beneficiary of this put option, have the option to sell their shares in CBM25 to CAB between October
1, 2021 and March 31, 2022.

LBI Développement initiated a new legal proceeding against CBM25 before the President of Tribunal Judiciaire of
Besançon to obtain provisional and protective measures concerning the assets of CBM25. By judgment dated February 2,
2021, the President of Tribunal Judiciaire of Besançon ordered the escrow of CBM25 shares, its securities register and its
shareholder accounts. On October, 20, 2021, the Court of Appeals of Besançon overturned this decision. LBI
Développement may choose to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeals before the French Supreme Court (Cour
_de cassation)._

Laboratoire Eimer consolidated the operations of CBM25 in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on the basis of de facto control over CBM25 exercised
by Laboratoire Eimer, the then ongoing appeal and on the basis of the Second SPA. For the year ended December 31, 2019,
the CBM25 contribution to our 2019 consolidated pro forma EBITDA amounted to €5.3 million. However, as of
December 1, 2020, given the termination of the Second SPA and the December 2020 Notice, Biogroup no longer exercises
_de facto control over CBM25 and Laboratoire Eimer had therefore deconsolidated the operations of CBM25 from its_
consolidated financial statements. As a result, the CBM25 Consideration was recorded as a claim against the CBM25
Sellers on our consolidated balance sheet going forward. Since July 7, 2019, there have been no financial transactions or
arrangements between CBM25 and Biogroup (such as cash pooling, distribution of dividends or the payment of
management fees) other than those in the ordinary course of trading and on arms' length terms. Since the release of escrow
ordered by the Appeal Court of Besançon, CBM25 shareholders are free to sell their shares to CAB. If so, the total purchase
price will be paid by offsetting against claims that CAB has over CBM25 shareholders.

**_Cerba Litigation_**

On December 14, 2020, Cerba Selafa, Cefid and Cerba Healthcare (the “Cerba Group”) initiated legal proceedings
against, among others, Laborizon, CAB and Laborizon Centre (the “Cerba Litigation”).

On March 29, 2017, three trade unions (Syndicat des Jeunes Biologistes Médicaux (“SJBM”), Syndicat des Biologistes
(“SdB”) and Syndicat des Laboratoires de Biologie Clinique (“SLBC”) and collectively, the “Trade Unions”) initiated
legal proceedings against, among others, the Cerba Group, based on unfair competition, alleging that the legal structure
and ownership of, among others, Cerba Group, albeit compliant with the letter of French law, would violate its spirit (the
“March 2017 Litigation”). Under the March 2017 Litigation, the Trade Unions are seeking a judgment against the Cerba
Group that would nullify or render inoperable certain provisions in the articles of incorporation and shareholder agreements
in certain of the Cerba Group’s subsidiaries that are subject to French legal restrictions on the legal structure and ownership
of medical laboratories.

Pursuant to the Cerba Litigation, the Cerba Group is seeking that the Tribunal de Grande Instance of Pontoise apply any
judgment rendered in favor of the Trade Unions under the March 2017 Litigation to, among others, Laborizon, CAB and
Laborizon Centre, as well.

Both the Cerba Litigation and the March 2017 Litigation are ongoing.

The procedural incident was pleaded before the Court on May 18, 2021. By deliberation delivered on September 2, 2021,
the Court rejected all of Cerba’s claims against Biogroup companies. Cerba Group appealed against this decision.


-----

Should a judgment be rendered in favor of the Trade Unions under the March 2017 Litigation and in favor of Cerba Group
under the Cerba Litigation, and appeals against such judgments prove unsuccessful, we would be subject to the decision of
the court under the March 2017 Litigation. While the legal and practical consequences of such judgment on Biogroup, our
subsidiaries and the medical laboratory industry in which we operate are currently unclear, we may be required to amend
the existing ownership and legal structure of our French operations and to implement a new structure for any future
acquisitions in France. See “Regulation—France” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not exercise
_full control over the operations of our French subsidiaries in which we have a minority voting interest, including the Issuer,_
_and are dependent on the biologists who own a majority voting interest in them to conduct the operations of such_
_subsidiaries.”_


-----

**Regulation**

_We are subject to extensive government regulation in each of the countries in which we operate across our lines of business._
_Regulations that pertain to operating requirements, professional qualifications of laboratory personnel, constraints on the_
_ownership of medical laboratories (which are especially strict in France), and pricing and reimbursement levels of medical_
_laboratory tests affect our business._

_We are also affected by numerous other laws and regulations that impose restrictions and requirements on the handling_
_and storing of certain chemicals and reagents as well as the disposal of biological refuse, govern the handling and storing_
_of personal data and aim to prevent fraud to social security systems._

**France**

**_Pricing and Reimbursement_**

With respect to pricing and reimbursement for medical lab testing in France, medical laboratories are bound by the prices
set by the Ministry of Health and CNAM. Prices are revised annually through negotiations among the Ministry of Health,
the National Health Insurance Fund and medical biologists’ labor unions. For the recent changes in the government
regulated lab testing prices, see “Industry—Medical Laboratory Testing,” and “Industry—France”. Based on the size of
the private lab market in the industry report and the proportion of spending in the French private medical testing market
according to “Les dépenses de santé en 2020 —Résultats des comptes de la santé,” a report published in 2021 by Panorama
de La Drees Santé, approximately 79.1% (or €4.9 billion) of spending in the French private medical testing market was
financed by the French social security system and the remainder was covered by private insurance companies
(approximately 17.2%, or €1.07 billion) and by the patient directly out-of-pocket (approximately 2.2%, or €0.138 billion)
in 2020.

The reimbursement of tests by the French National Health Insurance is subject to a regulatory procedure before the French
High Health Authority (“HAS”) and its specialized Medical Device and Health Technology Evaluation Committee
(“CNEDIMTS”) followed by an agreement with the National Health Insurance Fund, which must be entered into by
medical laboratories and each of the pathologists practicing within the laboratory. Any failure of one of the pathologists or
of the laboratory to comply with the terms of the aforementioned agreement may lead to the suspension of reimbursement
by the National Health Insurance Fund (déconventionnement).

As of October 15, 2021, the French government decided to stop reimbursing PCR testing and so-called “comfort” antigen
tests for anyone who was unvaccinated subject to certain limited exceptions to encourage vaccination.

**_Quality and Accreditation Standards for testing activities_**

French law used to require an administrative authorization (autorisation administrative) for the establishment and operation
of medical laboratories. As part of the authorization process, local health authorities reviewed a filing detailing the
laboratory’s corporate form and governance, premises, equipment, tests, and operating procedures, as well as the
professional qualifications of the laboratory’s personnel, including medical biologists. The law sets minimal standards to
be met in each of these areas. A laboratory had to inform local health authorities of changes affecting any of the above
matters.

Pursuant to an ordinance dated January 13, 2010 (ordonnance n° 2010-49 relative à la biologie médicale), which was
ratified by law No 2013-442 dated May 30, 2013 related to the reform of medical biology, the existing administrative
authorization process has been gradually replaced after November 1, 2020 (with an intermediary step in 2016, concerning
50% of the tests performed by a laboratory) by an accreditation procedure to be carried out by COFRAC. The accreditation
procedure introduces new, stricter requirements for medical laboratories pursuant to standards promulgated by the ISO
(namely, the ISO 15189 standard). The ordinance provides for an accreditation transitional regime which has been further
amended by law No 2020-734 to May 1, 2021, an order dated April 10, 2021 and an order dated June 1, 2021 (arrêté du
_1er juin 2021 prescrivant les mesures générales nécessaires à la gestion de la sortie de crise sanitaire), whereby:_


-----

      - until October 31, 2020, a non-accredited medical laboratory may not operate on the basis of its administrative
authorization without complying with the regulatory requirements described above relating to, notably, premises,
equipment and mandatory minimums on the number of medical biologists. However, the administrative
authorization could be withdrawn if by November 1, 2016, the laboratory had not been accredited for 50% of the
tests it performs; yet, medical laboratories were allowed to continue to operate until December 31, 2017 if they
fulfilled two criteria: being accredited for (i) each of the three families of examinations practiced (biochemistry-
genetics, immunology-hematology-reproductive biology, microbiology) and for (ii) at least 50% of their activity;

      - since November 1, 2013, a non-accredited medical laboratory is required to demonstrate that it has effectively
begun the new accreditation process; and

      - as from November 1, 2021, a medical laboratory may no longer perform medical biology examinations
corresponding to the scope lines (lignes de portée) for which it is not accredited without having submitted to
COFRAC an application for accreditation relating to these scope lines.

The order dated July 16, 2020 (arrêté définissant le cadre de l’accréditation mentionnée à l’article L. 6221-1 du code de
_la santé publique) and the order dated March 8, 2021 (arrêté fixant les examens représentatifs et les compétences associées_
_pour l’accréditation des lignes de portée des examens de biologie médicale) provide additional details on the content of_
scope line accreditation: the scope line is considered as accredited when one or more representative examinations for the
scope line in question, combining common professional competencies (metrology, staff authorizations, etc.), are accredited
by COFRAC.

The accreditation is issued for a maximum period of four years. During this first four-year period, COFRAC conducts its
first on-site surveillance audit at 12-months after the initial accreditation takes effect and then in such way that the
laboratory is evaluated on site every 15 months at most. The accreditation is renewable for periods of up to 5 years following
an on-site assessment. After the renewal of the accreditation, on-site surveillance audits of the laboratory by COFRAC take
place every 23 months at most.

COFRAC may suspend or revoke a laboratory’s accreditation for all or part of the laboratory’s business if such laboratory
fails to comply with the requisite health, safety and quality standards. Furthermore, French law provides for substantial
fines and penalties if the regulatory requirements for the grant of administrative authorizations and/or accreditation are
breached.

If a medical laboratory, incorporated as a company, is accredited for 100% of the tests it performs, there is no limit under
French law as to the number of branch offices (sites) that it may operate. If a medical laboratory, incorporated as a company,
is not accredited for 100% of the tests it performs, it cannot increase the total number of branch offices open to the public
and is restricted to relocating existing sites. However, regardless of its level of accreditation, a laboratory company may
not open sites in more than three contiguous regional zones as delimited by each regional health authority (zone déterminée
_en application du b du 2° de l’article L. 1434-9 du Code de la santé publique) and for each branch office, at least one_
medical biologist shall be appointed to enable a speedy medical support to each branch office (meaning that a laboratory
company must have at least as many medical biologists as branch offices). Furthermore, regional health authorities
(agences régionales de santé) may further deny opening of new medical laboratories (or new branch offices of existing
laboratories) within a given geographic area as delimited by each regional health authority (zone déterminée en application
_du b du 2° de l’article L. 1434-9 du Code de la santé publique) if the proposed laboratory’s testing operations would cause_
the offer of testing operations to exceed by 25% the relevant zone’s testing needs. Health authorities may also veto
acquisitions of laboratory companies or branch offices, or mergers of laboratory companies if the share of the tests
performed by the consolidated laboratory would exceed 25% of the total number of tests performed in the relevant zone.
Furthermore, the acquisition of shares of a laboratory company is prohibited if such acquisition would result in the acquirer
controlling, directly or indirectly, the performance of more than 33% of the tests performed in the relevant zone.

French law also limits the number of tests that can be outsourced by a medical laboratory to other laboratories every year
to 15% of the total number of tests it conducts. This limitation does not apply to the outsourcing of tests between branch
offices of a single medical laboratory company. The outsourcing of tests is monitored by the regional health authorities


-----

and the absence of representation or misrepresentation concerning outsourced activities may give rise to administrative
sanctions.

**_Additional Requirements for laboratories involved in medically assisted procreation activities_**

Pursuant to the Public Health Code, biological activities of medically assisted procreation may be performed only in
accredited medical biology laboratories.

In addition, medically assisted procreation activities, both medical and biological, must be authorized by the Director-
General of the regional health authority (Agence Régionale de santé or ARS) after obtaining the opinion of (i) the
specialized commission of the Regional Conference on Health and Autonomy responsible for the health sector (commission
_spécialisée de la conférence régionale de la santé et de l'autonomie compétente pour le secteur sanitaire) and of the_
Biomedicine Agency (Agence de biomédecine).

The authorization covers one or more of the following biological activities:

      - the preparation and preservation of semen for artificial insemination;

      - activities relating to in vitro fertilization without or with micromanipulation, including in particular:

 the collection, preparation and storage of semen;

 oocyte preparation and in vitro fertilization with or without micromanipulation;

      - the collection, preparation, storage and availability of sperm for donation;

      - the preparation, storage and availability of oocytes for donation;

      - the storage of gametes and germ tissue for autologous use in application of Article L. 2141-11 of the Public Health
Code;

      - the storage of embryos for parental projects;

      - the storage of embryos for the purpose of their reception.

The authorization is granted to a laboratory with reference to the affiliated medical pathologist who is qualified to practice
in the field of medically assisted procreation.

The authorization is issued for a period of seven years (five years for authorizations issued before January 5, 2018) and
may be renewed.

Medical laboratories must perform their medically assisted procreation activities on premises separate from the main
premises of the laboratory. In addition, biomedical laboratories authorized to perform medically assisted procreation
activities (i) must submit an annual activity report to the ARS and the Biomedicine Agency and (ii) are subject to
administrative control at least every two years.

Performing medically assisted reproduction activities without obtaining authorization or without complying with its
requirements is punishable by two years' imprisonment and a fine of €30,000.

Any violation found in an establishment or laboratory of the requirements laid down in the authorization to perform
medically assisted procreation activities leads to the suspension or withdrawal of the authorization.


-----

**_Professional Licensing and Ethics_**

Medical biologists, technicians and laboratory personnel collecting patient samples must meet certain minimum
professional qualifications.

In France, each medical laboratory must be supervised during business hours by at least one medical biologist who acts as
the legal representative of the laboratory company and is responsible for its operations, including the processing of tests
outsourced to other laboratories. In each branch office, at least one medical biologist of the laboratory company must be
able to meet the needs of the branch office and, if necessary, to intervene in a time frame compatible with patient safety
requirements.

Medical biologists must be registered with the pharmacists’ professional association (Ordre des Pharmaciens) or the
medical doctors’ professional association (Ordre des Médecins, together, the “Ordres”), depending on whether they are
qualified as pharmacists or medical doctors. Through their membership in an Ordre, medical biologists working in medical
laboratories are subject to the same rules of professional conduct as medical doctors and pharmacists set by the relevant
_Ordre. Laboratory companies must also be registered with one or both Ordres, based on the professional affiliation of the_
medical biologists practicing within such laboratories.

The Ordre des Pharmaciens and the Ordre des Médecins are self-regulatory bodies with administrative and disciplinary
powers over practicing professionals. They also represent, respectively, the collective interests of pharmacists and medical
doctors (including in both cases, medical biologists) before French public authorities and may be called upon to issue
opinions (avis) on certain matters involving their profession, including proposed laws and regulations. The _Ordres also_
monitor compliance by practicing professionals with applicable laws and regulations.

Among the professional conduct rules enforced by the Ordre des Pharmaciens is the principle of independence defined in
Article R.4235-18 of the French Public Health Code. Pursuant to this principle, a pharmacist may not be subject to any
financial, commercial, technical or moral constraint, if such constraint could impair his or her professional independence.
A similar provision affecting medical doctors, Article R.4127-5 of the French Public Health Code, provides that a medical
doctor cannot, in any manner or form, compromise his or her professional independence.

The _Ordre des Pharmaciens_ and the _Ordre des Médecins_ regulate access to the profession by maintaining respective
national registries of practicing professionals (each, a _Tableau de l’Ordre), on which every practicing pharmacist or_
medical doctor, as well as every medical laboratory company, must be registered. New medical laboratories, including
entities formed by the merger of pre-existing laboratories, must apply for registration on the relevant Tableau de l’Ordre
as a prerequisite to obtaining administrative authorization. An Ordre may withhold or suspend registration due to violation
of the relevant professional conduct rules.

Medical laboratories are subject to ongoing regulatory supervision by each of the _Ordres and, as a consequence, must_
submit to the relevant _Ordre_ for review any proposed change in their capital ownership or articles of association, any
cooperation contracts entered into with other medical laboratories and, more generally, any agreements relating to their
operations or governing the relations between their shareholders. Upon its review, the Ordre may inform regional health
authorities of any perceived regulatory violations. The regional health authorities are not bound by the findings of the
relevant Ordre in this respect. As part of its disciplinary powers, each professional association may impose disciplinary
sanctions on medical biologists, including the temporary or permanent suspension of practicing professionals who have
breached professional conduct rules.

It is worth mentioning that, following a complaint lodged by Labco, it has been found by the General Court of the European
Union that the Ordre des Pharmaciens had restricted competition on the medical biology analysis market by adopting a
restrictive interpretation of French regulations in order to prevent groups of laboratories from developing in France
(Judgment of 10th December 2014, Case T-90/11, Ordre national des pharmaciens and Others v Commission).

Regional health authorities in France monitor compliance by medical laboratories with health and safety regulations
through on-site inspections. In addition, certain tests or categories of tests are controlled by specialized agencies as part of
a yearly quality control program. Regional health authorities may impose administrative sanctions on medical laboratories


-----

and, in certain instances, medical biologists, for violations of certain regulatory requirements, including health, safety and
quality regulations. These sanctions range from fines to the temporary or permanent closing of the laboratory, in the case
of particularly serious or repeated violations. Certain illegal activities, including the illegal practice of medical biology
(exercice illégal des fonctions de biologiste médical) and the misleading use of the title of medical biologist by a person
without the legal right to do so (usage sans droit de la qualité de biologiste médical), carry criminal penalties that range
from the prohibition to practice medical biology or operate a medical laboratory to imprisonment for individuals.

In addition, medical laboratories may not advertise their services, directly or indirectly, to the general public. Certain
information provided to medical doctors is, however, excluded from this prohibition, notably information of a medical or
scientific nature, and upon opening of a new laboratory, the public announcement of the laboratory’s existence, location,
and test offerings.

Further, medical laboratories and their practicing medical doctors are subject to transparency requirements under the so-
called “French Sunshine Act”. Law no. 2011-2012 of December 29, 2011 on the Strengthening of Health Protection for
Medicinal and Health Products (loi relative au renforcement de la sécurité sanitaire du médicament et des produits de
_santé), also known as the “Loi Bertrand”, as amended, introduced specific transparency obligations for all companies_
manufacturing or commercializing health products or providing associated services.

Companies providing associated services include companies providing technical services (e.g., installation, maintenance,
user training) related to the use of health products, companies providing health products or services subject to the
reimbursement by the social security system, and companies involved in the communication and advertising thereof.

The aforementioned companies must disclose the existence of agreements (excluding agreements regarding the purchase
of goods or the provision of services) entered into with, remunerations and fringe benefits greater or equal to €10 (taxes
included) provided to, ten categories of health care actors listed in Article L. 1453-1 of the Public Health Code:

      - Health care professionals (e.g. physicians, pharmacists, nurses, mid-wives, etc.);

      - Associations of health care professionals;

      - Students intending to become health care professionals and representative groups and associations of these
students;

      - Patient associations;

      - Health establishments referred to in the Part 6 of the French Public Health Code (including, notably, hospitals
and medical laboratories);

      - Non-profit associations (e.g. foundations) and advisory boards in the healthcare sector;

      - Publishing companies, radio and television publishers, and publishers of online (public) communication services
(in particular scientific and medical press);

      - Media and social media influencers;

      - Designers of software for prescription and delivery of health products; and

      - Legal entities providing or participating in the initial and continuing training of healthcare professionals (e.g.
universities or university hospitals).

The Information that is required to be disclosed under the transparency requirements must be submitted to the Ministry of
Health. The information is then published on the public transparency website, www.transparence.sante.gouv.fr.


-----

Companies that “knowingly” violate the transparency requirements may be subject to a criminal fine of up to €225,000.
Additional sanctions, such as a ban on participation in public tenders, suspension of business activities, and temporary or
permanent closing of facilities may also apply. Individuals may also face sanctions such as the public communication of
the sentence, being barred from exercising a public function or a commercial or industrial profession, and a prohibition to
commercialize, import and market health products.

Ultimately, in parallel to the transparency obligations, medical laboratories and healthcare professionals running and
providing services in such a laboratory are also subject to the French anti-gift rules, as recently revised. The anti-gift
framework is now governed by Articles L. 1453-3 et seq. and Articles R. 1453-2 to R. 1453-19 of the French Public Health
Code. The principle is that of a large prohibition of any transfer of value (in kind or in cash), direct or indirect, between
the companies (referred to in Article L. 1453-5 of the Public Health Code) and the beneficiaries (listed in Article L. 1453-
4 of the Public Health Code) covered by the anti-gift framework, subject to specific exemptions).

The ban to grant benefits applies to all companies producing or marketing products covered by compulsory social security
schemes or health products mentioned in Article L. 5311-1 II of the Public Health Code such as medicines, medical devices,
cosmetic products etc. The ban is further aimed at all “companies/persons providing health services”, which notably include
natural or legal persons carrying out an activity covered by an authorization, approval or declaration scheme provided for
in Part 6 of the Public Health Code (i.e. Health Establishments and Services). This covers medical laboratories which are
therefore subject to the anti-gift rules.

Consequently, medical laboratories are not allowed to offer benefits, and healthcare professionals running / providing
services in such laboratories (e.g. medical biologists) are not allowed to receive them, subject to the exceptions set forth in
the anti-gift regulations.

By way of derogation, only certain benefits can be offered subject to strict conditions and formalities (Article L. 1453-7 of
the Public Health Code):

      - Fees or payments in relation to research, consulting and, more generally, service agreements, provided that the
fees are proportional to the service rendered;

      - Gifts, in cash or in kind, for research, research valuation or scientific assessment activities;

      - Prizes or competitions to reward scientific research;

      - Research grants;

      - Gifts to healthcare professional associations, except in case the main purpose is unrelated to the professional
activity;

      - Hospitality provided during promotional, professional or scientific events, provided that the hospitality is
reasonable, limited to the main professional and scientific objective of the event, and is not extended to persons
other than recipients listed in Article L. 1453-4 of the Public Health Code;

      - Funding to promote continuing medical education;

Non-compliance with the anti-gift regulations may be sanctioned by up to two years of imprisonment and be subject to a
criminal fine of up to €750,000. This amount can be increased to 50% of the value of the benefits constituting the offence.
Ancillary sanctions may also apply, such as a ban on participating in public tenders, the suspension of business activities,
or the closing of facilities.

**_Laboratory Ownership and Corporate Structure_**

French law also contains specific provisions dealing with the corporate form through which a medical laboratory can be
operated and imposes limitations on who can hold the capital stock and exercise the voting rights within such corporations.


-----

These provisions and limitations reflect the traditional view in France that medical laboratories are engaged in medical
activity conducted through small, privately owned entities by independent professionals (profession libérale).

Owners of a medical laboratory who do not want to operate their laboratory directly can incorporate their business through
a non-profit organization, a société civile professionnelle (“SCP”) or a cooperative undertaking or SEL. SELs can take
several forms: société d’exercice libéral à responsabilité limitée (“SELARL”), société d’exercice libéral à forme anonyme
(“SELAFA”), société d’exercice libéral en commandite par actions (“SELCA”) or SELAS Another specific corporate
form is the _société de participations financières de professions libérales_ (“SPFPL”), which cannot directly operate a
medical laboratory but may serve as a holding company for SELs. All our French medical laboratories are incorporated as
SELAS or SELAFA.

The following principles apply to SELs in general:

      - a medical biologist can only act as a responsible medical biologist for, and therefore manage, one SEL;

      - more than half of the share capital and the voting rights must be held by medical biologists practicing within the
SEL or by an SPFPL constituted by the medical biologists practicing within the SEL. French law used to provide
for an exception whereby more than 50% of the share capital of a laboratory company could be held by individuals
or legal entities which were external medical biologists or laboratory companies if these individuals or entities
had an activity within the corporate purpose of the laboratory company considered or were SPFPL. However, law
n° 2013-442 dated May 30, 2013 related to the reform of medical biology has removed this exception, such change
only affecting laboratory companies set up after its enactment, _i.e._ after May 31, 2013. Consequently, any
laboratory company set up after that date is subject to the following limitation regarding its ownership: more than
50% of its share capital and voting rights must be held, directly or indirectly through an SPFPL, by medical
biologists working within the laboratory company considered. With regards to laboratory companies set up prior
to May 31, 2013, which, at that date, did not comply with this requirement, they can still benefit from the former
exception regarding ownership by external medical biologists and laboratory companies (grandfather clause).
However, in case of transfer of their shares, priority shall be given to medical biologists working within the
laboratory company considered. If the latter are unable to buy such shares, said shares can be sold to any external
medical biologist or laboratory company or SPFPL, or—within the limitations provided by law for the
shareholding of laboratory companies by non-biologists—to persons who are not medical biologists and legal
entities that are not laboratory companies;

      - persons who are not medical biologists and legal entities that are not laboratory companies cannot directly hold
more than 25% of the share capital and voting rights of a SEL (except for SELCAs, for which this proportion shall
be more than 25% but must be less than 50%); to prevent conflicts of interest, certain types of professionals or
entities (including other health professionals, medical suppliers, pension funds and insurance companies, and
persons or entities holding a stake of more than 10% of certain of these restricted professions or businesses) are
prevented from holding shares in an SEL directly or indirectly;

      - the number of medical biologists practicing within a medical laboratory, holding a fraction of the share capital
and working at least half-time in this medical laboratory must be equal to or greater than the number of branch
offices in that laboratory company;

      - at least once a year, the company must provide the Ordre des Pharmaciens and/or the Ordre des Médecins with
a statement regarding the composition of its share capital;

      - a shareholder may not provide the laboratory company with a sum that exceeds three times the amount of its
participation in the capital (in case of a professional shareholder practicing within the laboratory company or its
entitled persons); one time the amount of its participation in the capital (for other shareholders), being specified
that, in case of breach, there is no specific sanction;

      - the transfer of shares is subject to the specific majorities (in a SELARL: majority of three-quarters of the practicing
shareholders; in a SELAFA (according to the articles of association): majority of two-thirds for the practicing


-----

shareholders or of two-thirds of the members of the supervisory board/board of directors practicing within the
SEL; in a SELCA: majority of two-thirds of the associés commandités; in a SELAS: majority of two-thirds of the
practicing shareholders).

      - the articles of association of laboratory companies may provide for the inalienability of shares for a period not
exceeding ten years; and

      - finally, in order to be enforceable (opposable), all arrangements concerning laboratory companies or their
shareholders that are not contained in the bylaws must be disclosed to, as the case may be, the _Ordre des_
_Pharmaciens and/or the Ordre des Médecins._

Certain aspects of the legal framework described above have been considered by the European Court of Justice. In March
2009, the European Commission commenced a proceeding against France, challenging two provisions of French law. First,
the Commission argued that the 25% ownership limitations placed on third-party non-professionals imposed an undue
burden on the freedom of establishment provided for in the Treaty Establishing the European Community. Second, the
Commission criticized as overly restrictive the rule by which qualified entities or individuals could not own shares in more
than two SELs. In its December 16, 2010 decision (Case C-89/09, European Commission v French Republic), the European
Court of Justice found in favor of France on the first count, holding that the ownership limitations placed on non-
professionals were reasonable in view of the state’s legitimate public health and safety concerns. The Court noted the threat
to such independence that might arise from financial pressures placed on medical biologists by third-party investors and
found that a Member State might validly conclude that the professional independence of medical biologists would not be
adequately preserved in structures where such professionals would only hold a minority of the share capital, regardless of
whether they were granted majority voting rights. The Court found against France on the second count, however, holding
that the ownership restriction placed by existing regulations on qualified professionals was unnecessary and
disproportionate to the public health objectives sought to be achieved. Pursuant to decree n° 2013-117 dated February 5,
2013 related to the conditions of operation of a laboratory by an SEL, individuals or legal entities who have an activity
within the corporate purpose of the SEL are no longer subject to the limitation according to which they could not own
shares in more than two SELs

**Belgium**

**_Pricing and Reimbursement_**

With respect to pricing and reimbursement for medical lab testing in Belgium, medical laboratories are bound by the prices
and reimbursement tariffs set by the Belgian government and RIZIV/INAMI. Prices are revised annually through
negotiations between healthcare providers and health insurance providers, organized in various committees within
RIZIV/INAMI, and finally approved by the Minister of Health. For the recent changes in the government regulated lab
testing prices, see “Industry—Medical Laboratory Testing,” “Industry—Market Overview” and “Industry—Belgium”.

Reimbursements by RIZIV/INAMI are only granted to medical laboratories that have been accredited by the Belgian
government (in accordance with the Royal Decree of December 3, 1999 on the accreditation of medical biology laboratories
and the Royal Decree of December 5, 2011 on the accreditation of pathological anatomy laboratories). Currently, the
pricing system includes a “claw-back” mechanism which allows the Belgian government to recover budgetary overspend
in future periods. Reimbursement levels for tests included in the RIZIV/INAMI catalog are set by the RIZIV/INAMI. In
certain cases (i.e., only when the laboratories are not “conventionalized” (geconventioneerd/conventionné)), laboratories
are allowed to bill a small supplemental administrative fee per patient in addition to the set price for a test. Laboratory tests
that are prescribed for non-therapeutic reasons may be excluded from the RIZIV/INAMI’s price regulation and are set
freely by individual laboratories.

**_Quality and Accreditation Standards_**

RIZIV/INAMI also requires that medical laboratories of pathological anatomy operating in Belgium meet certain
operational standards set forth by BELAC, the Belgian national accreditation organization. Laboratories are subject to an
inspection every year during the first 3-year period of accreditation. During the third year of the initial 3-year accreditation


-----

period, BELAC will conduct an inspection to verify whether the medical laboratory complies with the requirements for a
5-year renewal period of the accreditation. During each such 5-year renewal period, BELAC will conduct minimum three
inspections (every 24 months at the latest) to verify compliance with BELAC’s standards.

**_Laboratory Ownership and Corporate Structure_**

The conditions with respect to ownership and corporate structure which medical laboratories must comply with are set
forth in Royal Decree No. 143 of December 30, 1982. In the case of medical laboratories operated by individuals, there is
an explicit prohibition on the operation of such laboratories by doctors who dispense prescriptions. Such doctors are also
barred from acting as directors, associates (vennoten/associés), members, managers (zaakvoerders/gérants) or designated
representatives of medical laboratory companies.

Legal form of ownership represents the primary regulatory constraint on the establishment and operation of medical
laboratories. These regulatory constraints are provided by the Royal Decree of April 26, 2007. The Royal Decree of April
26, 2007, which implements Article 3 §1(2) of Royal Decree No. 143 of December 30, 1982, lists the legal forms that
medical laboratory companies should take in order to be eligible for reimbursement by the Belgian public health insurance
system. The duration of this Royal Decree, which was initially due to expire on December 31, 2009, has been extended
until December 31, 2012 by a Royal Decree of January 27, 2010. To date, no new extension has been enacted. The relevant
agencies have not shown any indication that reimbursements would cease. The current legal gap should be filled by a new
Decree which, to date, is still in a draft form and should be submitted to the Belgian government for approval. According
to oral sources at Sciensano (the former Scientific Institute of Public Health), this new Decree should (i) leave unchanged
the four legal forms that medical laboratories should take in order to be eligible for reimbursement by the Belgian public
health insurance system and (ii) will provide that these rules are no longer subject to expiration. Note that this information
has been obtained by unofficial sources at Sciensano and it is currently unclear whether and when a new Decree will be
adopted and, if so, what its content will be. The absence of any form of extension of the duration of the Royal Decree of
April 26, 2007 could have a significant impact on all Belgian laboratories run under the same corporate form as ours,
including us. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry – _We operate in a highly regulated_
_sector. Compliance with regulations applicable to our activities may increase our costs or restrict our activities. Failure_
_to comply with such regulations may lead to penalties of various types. Future alterations to regulations applicable to us_
_may have a material adverse impact on our activities.”_

The Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 specifies that, in addition to hospitals, universities and other public bodies, only certain
legal entities may operate medical laboratories, namely civil companies incorporated in the form of a BV/SRL (besloten
_vennootschap_ _/société à responsabilité limitée), a general partnership (vennootschap onder firma/société en nom collectif),_
a cooperative company (coöperatieve vennootschap/société coopérative) or a non-profit legal entity (rechtspersoon zonder
_winstoogmerk/personne morale sans but lucratif)._

The provisions of Belgian company law applicable to Belgian companies that are eligible to operate medical laboratories
in accordance with the Royal Decree impose certain restrictions on the transferability of the shares of such companies. For
example, any contemplated transfer of shares in a BV/SRL must be consented to by half of the shareholders holding shares
representing 75% of the capital of the company (minus the value of the shares which are being transferred). There are no
requirements as to the legal form of an entity purchasing shares of a BV/SRL. Belgian law does not provide for any specific
rules with respect to the voting rights attached to the shares of a laboratory company.

In addition to restrictions on corporate form and share transferability, the Royal Decree of December 30, 1982 and the
Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 set forth additional general regulations affecting a laboratory company’s conduct. Among
other things, such rules stipulate that:

      - the laboratory company must not have a corporate or statutory purpose other than the operation of medical
laboratories;

      - the articles of association of a laboratory company must include a provision to the effect that the company is
required to strive for a standard of quality that avoids any act entailing complementary expenses which are not


-----

justified by the compulsory healthcare insurer, by the patient or by the persons who insure the payment of these
services (to the extent that the Royal Decree of April 26, 2007 remains applicable after January 1, 2013);

      - the laboratory company is required to conclude a written agreement (subject to approval by the Minister of Health)
with any persons performing services on its behalf which should minimally include (i) the financial provisions
applicable to the laboratory activity and (ii) the working conditions under which the providers carry out their
activities in the laboratory, including their free choice to perform such services as they wish and their access to
all means necessary to guarantee the quality of the services rendered (in particular the equipment, the personnel
and the method to be applied);

      - the laboratory company is required to organize a central collection of fees and other compensations paid by
patients or third parties;

      - the laboratory company may not (i) accord any benefits, directly or indirectly, to medical professionals who
dispense prescriptions, and (ii) influence these professionals in any way; and

      - the laboratory company must provide the Minister of Health with an annual list of its members or associates
(vennoten/associés) and must maintain separate accounting records, prepared in accordance with accounting
standards set by the Royal Decree of November 18, 1983.

**_Professional Licensing and Ethics_**

Similarly to France, medical biologists, technicians and laboratory personnel collecting patient samples in Belgium must
meet certain minimum professional qualifications. The Coordinated Law of May 10, 2015 regarding the practice of health
professions includes the essential requirements governing the practice of paramedical professions. Since 2019 new
requirements for medical laboratory technologists have been set forth in a Royal Decree of January 17, 2019. In the context
of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the lack of sufficient qualified medical laboratory technologists, the Royal Decree of
September, 21 2020 allows non-qualified personnel to prepare and conduct certain testing activities solely in the context
of possible COVID-19 infections and under the supervision and responsibility of an accredited medical laboratory. This
temporary exception was originally in force until October 1, 2021, but was extended by the Royal Decree of September
13, 2021 until April 1, 2022.

**Description of Other Indebtedness**

_The following summary of certain provisions of the documents listed below governing certain of our indebtedness does not_
_purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents._

**Existing Senior Notes**

On February 9, 2021, Laboratoire Eimer completed the issuance of €250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00%
Senior Notes due 2029, pursuant to an offering not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The
Existing Senior Notes are governed by an indenture dated the Original Issue Date between, among others, Laboratoire
Eimer, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as trustee and Elavon Financial Services DAC as security agent. As of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, €250 million aggregate principal amount of Existing Senior Notes was outstanding.

The Existing Senior Notes will mature on February 1, 2029. Interest on the Existing Senior Notes is payable semi-annually
in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. Interest on the Existing Senior Notes accrues from the Original Issue
Date.

The Existing Senior Notes are senior obligations of Laboratoire Eimer and (i) rank pari passu in right of payment with any
existing and future indebtedness of Laboratoire Eimer that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Existing
Senior Notes, including its guarantee under the Notes; (ii) rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future
indebtedness of Laboratoire Eimer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Existing Senior Notes; (iii) are
structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the subsidiaries of Laboratoire Eimer that are not
Guarantors or guarantors of the Existing Senior Notes, including obligations owed to trade creditors; and (iv) are effectively
subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of Laboratoire Eimer and its subsidiaries that is secured
by property and assets that do not secure the Existing Senior Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets
securing such indebtedness or obligation.

The Existing Senior Notes are guaranteed by the Issuer and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries of the Issuer on a
senior subordinated basis. The guarantees of the Existing Senior Notes by each guarantor will: (i) be a senior subordinated
obligation of that guarantor, (ii) be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior debt of that guarantor,
including that guarantor’s guarantee of the indebtedness under the Notes and the Senior Facilities; (iii) rank pari passu in
right of payment with any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of that guarantor that is not expressly subordinated
in right of payment to such guarantee; (iv) rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of such
guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such guarantee; (v) be effectively subordinated to any
existing or future indebtedness or obligation of such guarantor that is secured on a first-priority basis by property and assets
that secure such guarantee on a second-priority basis or by property and assets that do not secure such guarantee, to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness or obligation; and (vi) be structurally subordinated
to any existing or future indebtedness of the subsidiaries of such guarantor that are not guarantors of the Existing Senior
Notes, including obligations owed to trade creditors. The guarantees of the Existing Senior Notes will be subject to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, including the subordination, payment blockage and standstill on enforcement
provisions thereunder and are subject to the Agreed Security Principles and other certain contractual and legal limitations.

The Existing Senior Notes are secured by first priority security interests over (i) share capital and other securities of
Laboratoire Eimer held respectively by Holdco and Biogold 2; (ii) share capital and other securities of Biogold 2 held by
Holdco; and (iii) intercompany receivables owed to Holdco by Laboratoire Eimer and Biogold 2.

Prior to February 1, 2024, Laboratoire Eimer may redeem all, or from time to time a portion of, the Existing Senior Notes
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Existing Senior Notes plus an applicable “make whole”
premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Prior to
February 1, 2024, Laboratoire Eimer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the original principal amount
of the Existing Senior Notes using the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 105.000%
of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption;
provided that at least 60% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Existing Senior Notes remains outstanding
after the redemption, and the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such equity offering. On or after


-----

February 1, 2024, Laboratoire Eimer may redeem all or a portion of the Existing Senior Notes at the redemption prices set
forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

**Year** **Redemption Price**

2024 ...................................................................................................................................... 102.500%

2025 ...................................................................................................................................... 101.250%

2026 and thereafter ............................................................................................................... 100.000%

The Existing Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary covenants and events of default.

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control”, Laboratoire Eimer is required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Existing Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash of 101% of the principal amount thereof on
the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase.
However, a change of control with respect to the Existing Senior Notes will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified
consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event.

**Senior Facilities Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

On the Original Issue Date, the Issuer entered into the Senior Facilities Agreement with, among others, Laboratoire Eimer
as original guarantor, the Issuer as company, original borrower and original guarantor; J.P. Morgan AG, BNP Paribas and
Natixis as global active coordinators and mandated lead arrangers, Citibank London NA, Crédit Agricole Corporate and
Investment Bank, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE and HSBC Continental Europe as
Bookrunners and Mandated Lead Arrangers, Natixis as agent and Elavon Financial Services DAC as the Security Agent.
The Senior Facilities Agreement provides for a Revolving Credit Facility in a principal amount of €271.0 million and a
Term Loan Facility in an initial principal amount of €1,450.0 million (the "Original Existing Term Loan Facility"),
which was increased in July 2021 by €300.0 million (the "Additional Existing Term Loan Facility") to an aggregate

The Existing Term Loan Facility was utilized by the Issuer, LBM Bioesterel, Bio Lam LCD, BPO-Bioépine, Unilians
(which has been merged into Dyomedea-Neolab on June 1, 2021 which was renamed Unilians Biogroup) and Biomer (the
“Original **TLB Borrowers”) to refinance certain existing indebtedness of the TLB Group (it being specified that for the**
purposes of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the “TLB Group” consists of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as
defined under the Senior Facilities Agreement)) and the payment of costs and expenses (including any breakage costs,
redemption premium and related fees) incurred by any member of the TLB Group in connection with the refinancing and
the Finance Documents (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) (including costs and fees thereunder) as set out in

indebtedness (including under one or more uncommitted additional facilities within the Senior Facilities Agreement)
provided that, pro forma for the incurrence of such additional facilities, the aggregate amount of indebtedness that the
Issuer or any other members of the TLB Group is permitted to incur under clause (b) of the first paragraph and clauses (1)
and (5)(ii) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “Description of the Notes –Limitation on Indebtedness”

**Intercreditor Agreement**

In connection with the entry into the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Indenture and the Indenture governing the Existing
Senior Notes (the “Existing Senior Notes Indenture”, Laboratoire Eimer, the Issuer and certain other members of the
Group, entered into an intercreditor agreement to govern the relationships on certain matters and relative priorities, among,
_inter alios, the holders of Senior Secured Debt (as defined below), the holders of Second Lien Debt (as defined below), the_
holders of Senior Subordinated Debt (as defined below), certain intra group lenders and subordinated creditors (as all such
capitalized terms are defined below) (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) with, amongst others, Natixis as Senior Facilities
agent, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as original Trustee for the Existing Senior Notes, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as original
Trustee for the Notes, Elavon Financial Services DAC as Security Agent and the Senior Facilities lenders.

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things:

      - the relative ranking of certain debt (including debt incurred under the Senior Facilities, the Existing Senior Notes
and the Notes) of the debtors;

      - the relative ranking of Transaction Security (defined below) granted by the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries
(the "SSN Group") and Laboratoire Eimer in its capacity as security provider;

      - when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the SSN Group;

      - when enforcement action (including acceleration and/or demand for payment and certain similar actions) can be
taken in respect of certain indebtedness of the SSN Group;

      - the terms pursuant to which certain indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency
events;

      - the order for applying proceeds from the enforcement of security, including the Transaction Security (defined
below), and other amounts received by the Security Agent; and turnover provisions.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions related to future indebtedness permitted by the Indenture that may be
incurred by (a) Laboratoire Eimer and (b) the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries which are guarantors (in relation to
indebtedness under paragraph (i) below) which may be secured by the Collateral securing the Notes, subject to the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement and any finance documentation then existing (including the Indenture and the Existing
Senior Notes Indenture). Such indebtedness will (i) have equivalent rights to (A) the holders of the Notes, (B) the holders
of the Senior Facilities liabilities and (C) hedge counterparties holding certain hedging liabilities (which are permitted to


-----

benefit from pari passu ranking as set out in the Description of the Notes contained herein) (such hedge counterparties
being “Hedge Counterparties”), under the Intercreditor Agreement and may vote in the same class of creditors as the
holders of the Notes liabilities, the holders of the Senior Facilities and the Hedge Counterparties in respect of enforcement
(such indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Notes, indebtedness under the Senior Facilities and indebtedness
owed to the Hedge Counterparties, being the “Senior Secured Debt”), (ii) have rights in respect of such indebtedness that
will be limited as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (such indebtedness being the “Second Lien Debt”) including in
respect of (A) when payments in respect of such indebtedness are permitted to be made, including the circumstances when
payments in respect of Second Lien Debt can be suspended (including through the issuance of a stop notice (and cure
provisions in respect thereof)), (B) restrictions on when the holders of Second Lien Debt can take enforcement action
(including standstill provisions in respect of Second Lien Debt) and (C) the ability of the holders of Second Lien Debt to
purchase Senior Secured Debt in certain circumstances or (iii) have equivalent rights to the holders of the Existing Senior
Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement and may vote in the same class of creditors as the holders of the Existing Senior
Notes liabilities in respect of enforcement (such indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Existing Senior Notes,
being the “Senior Subordinated Debt”), it being specified that such Senior Subordinated Debt will have rights in respect
of such indebtedness incurred by members of the SSN Group as guarantee obligations that will be limited as set out in the
Intercreditor Agreement including in respect of (A) when payments by members of the SSN Group in respect of such
indebtedness are permitted to be made, including the circumstances when payments in respect of Senior Subordinated Debt
can be suspended (including through the issuance of a stop notice (and cure provisions in respect thereof)), (B) restrictions
on when the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt can take enforcement action (including standstill provisions in respect
of Senior Subordinated Debt); _provided that the Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to restrict holders of Senior_
Subordinated Debt to take enforcement action against Laboratoire Eimer or any person which is not a member of the SSN
Group and (C) the ability of the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt to purchase Senior Secured Debt and Second Lien
Debt in certain circumstances.

As set forth in “—Ranking and priority” below, any Second Lien Debt is subordinated to any Senior Secured Debt and any
Senior Subordinated Debt guarantees granted by members of the SSN Group is subordinated to the Senior Secured Debt
and the Second Lien Debt on the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. Any Second Lien Debt must be bullet and its
maturity date must be at least six months after the latest maturity date of any Senior Secured Debt (excluding under any
hedging agreement) and the issuer or borrower of Second Lien Debt must be the Issuer. Any Senior Subordinated Debt
must be bullet and its maturity date must be at least six months after the latest maturity date of any Second Lien Debt, or
if no such Second Lien Debt is in existence at that time, any Senior Secured Debt (excluding under any hedging agreement)
and the issuer or borrower of any Senior Subordinated Debt must be Laboratoire Eimer.

By accepting a Note or an Existing Senior Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted
the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate
the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it, and not the discussion that
follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes.

_Ranking and priority_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that (1) the liabilities owing to the holders of Senior Secured Debt rank pari passu
in right and priority of payment between themselves and in priority to (A) the holders of Second Lien Debt, (B) the holders
of Senior Subordinated Debt (including all liabilities under any loan that would be made by any entity which is not a
member of the SSN Group for the purposes of on-lending the proceeds of any Senior Subordinated Debt to the Issuer (the
“Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan”)) and (C) all intra-SSN Group liabilities required to be subordinated as per the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Intra-SSN Group Liabilities”) and liabilities owed by the Issuer to any Issuer’s
subordinated creditor (including to Laboratoire Eimer (other under any Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan)), (2) the
liabilities owing to the holders of Second Lien Debt rank pari passu in right and priority of payment between themselves
and in priority to the Senior Subordinated Debt (including all liabilities under any Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan) and
all Intra-SSN Group Liabilities and liabilities owed by the Issuer to any Issuer’s subordinated creditor (including to
Laboratoire Eimer (other under any Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan)) and (3) the liabilities owing to the holders of
Senior Subordinated Debt (including all liabilities under any Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan) rank pari passu in right


-----

and priority of payment between themselves and in priority to all Intra-SSN Group Liabilities and liabilities owed by the
Issuer to any Issuer’s subordinated creditor (including to Laboratoire Eimer (other under any Senior Subordinated Proceeds
Loan)).

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities owing to the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt rank
in priority to all liabilities owed by Laboratoire Eimer to any of Laboratoire Eimer’s subordinated creditor.

The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank the Intra-SSN Group Liabilities or the liabilities owed by the Issuer
to any Issuer’s subordinated creditor (including to Laboratoire Eimer (other under any Senior Subordinated Proceeds
Loan)) as between themselves.

The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank the liabilities owed by Laboratoire Eimer to any of Laboratoire
Eimer’s subordinated creditor as between themselves.

The Intercreditor Agreement does not rank or restrict the payment by Laboratoire Eimer of any existing liabilities arising
under or in connection with any agreement or instrument in respect of Senior Secured Debt or Second Lien Debt.

_Guarantees and security_

The lenders under the Senior Facilities, the hedge counterparties, the holders of the Notes and other holders of Senior
Secured Debt, any holders of the Second Lien Debt and the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt may subject to certain
limits benefit from a common guarantee and security package (the “Transaction Security”). The liabilities owing to the
Senior Facilities lenders, the hedge counterparties, the holders of the Notes, the other holders of Senior Secured Debt, the
holders of Second Lien Debt and the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt may, to the extent permitted under applicable
law and subject to certain limits be guaranteed by the same debtors and will be secured by the same Transaction Security.
To the extent permitted by the Indenture, holders of Senior Secured Debt, Second Lien Debt and/or Senior Subordinated
Debt (together, the “Secured Parties”) are entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to receive the benefit of such
Transaction Security on the basis set forth in “—Ranking and priority” above.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains covenants restricting holders of Senior Secured Debt, Second Lien Debt and/or
Senior Subordinated Debt from taking any additional guarantees or security from the SSN Group unless given for the
benefit of the holders of the Notes subject to the Agreed Security Principles. Unless there is a legal restriction on doing so,
the Security Agent shall hold the Transaction Security for the benefit of the Secured Parties to the extent each has the
benefit of the relevant Transaction Security.

The holders of Senior Subordinated Debt may benefit from (i) security over the shares held in Laboratoire Eimer and its
respective affiliates and over the rights owed under any shareholder loan to any holding company of Laboratoire Eimer
and (ii) the assets, rights and related proceeds owned by Laboratoire Eimer which are not subject to Transaction Security
granted in favor of the Security Agent as trustee and/or agent for the account of the holders of Senior Secured Debt and the
holders of Second Lien Debt in their capacities as Secured Parties, and excluding for the avoidance of doubt, in each case,
any Transaction Security (the “Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security”). In addition, the holders of Senior
Subordinated Debt may benefit from guarantees granted by affiliates of Laboratoire Eimer other than the Issuer or any of
its restricted subsidiaries.

_Priority of security_

The Transaction Security shall rank and secure the liabilities in respect of Senior Secured Debt, Second Lien Debt and/or
Senior Subordinated Debt (but only to the extent such Transaction Security is expressed to secure those liabilities and
irrespective of the date on which such Transaction Security was created and/or perfected) in the following order: firstly the
liabilities in respect of Senior Secured Debt pari passu and without any preference between them; secondly the liabilities
in respect of the Second Lien Debt pari passu and without any preference between them; and thirdly the liabilities in respect
of the Senior Subordinated Debt pari passu and without any preference between them, with the proceeds of the Transaction
Security to be applied as described under “—Application of recoveries” below.


-----

The Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security shall rank and secure the liabilities in respect of Senior Subordinated Debt
_pari passu in right and priority of payment and without any preference between them (but only to the extent such Senior_
Subordinated Debt Only Security is expressed to secured such Senior Subordinated Debt).

_Restrictions on payments_

Prior to the final discharge date of all Senior Secured Debt, there shall be no restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement
on payments to be made to holders of Senior Secured Debt, save that the Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions
regulating payments in respect of hedging liabilities due to Hedge Counterparties following the occurrence of an
acceleration event in respect of the senior secured liabilities or an insolvency event in relation to a member of the SSN
Group.

and/or trustee of any Senior Secured Debt on or before the discharge of the Senior Secured Debt to the Issuer, the Security
Agent and the agent and/or trustee of any Second Lien Debt); (ii) the payment is of any of the Second Lien Debt liabilities
in accordance with any provision relating to illegality in respect of a lender/noteholder in the relevant agreement or
instrument in respect of Second Lien Debt; (iii) the payment is by way of capitalization of interest or by the issuance of a

liabilities, (B) if at the level of the Issuer, any liability of the Issuer to the holders of any Second Lien Debt arising as a

Senior Secured Debt in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, (C) no member of the SSN Group
becomes liable for or incur any material tax liability as a result of such payment and a tax report from a reputable accountant
is provided to the Security Agent confirming that no such material tax lability has arisen or will arise; (D) no Change of
Control would arise as a result of such payment and (E) at the time that payment becomes effective, no distressed disposal

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms and subject to the consultation
requirements described below, an instructing group may give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to
enforce or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security or take other enforcement action as it sees fit.

Prior to the final discharge date of all Senior Secured Debt, the holders of Second Lien Debt may only take certain
enforcement action against any member of the SSN Group or third-party security provider in respect of liabilities in relation
to Second Lien Debt and/or any Transaction Security (i) if (A) an event of default under any agreement or instrument in
respect Second Lien Debt is continuing (the occurrence of which has been notified to the relevant representatives, agents
and/or trustees of any Senior Secured Debt by the relevant agent and/or trustee of the Second Lien Debt) and (B) a period
of (x) 90 days in relation to a payment event of default or (y) 150 days in relation to any other event of default in each case
in respect of any Second Lien Debt has elapsed since the date of such notice referred to in (A) or such earlier time
contemplated in the Intercreditor Agreement) and the applicable event of default referred to in (A) is continuing (a “Second
**Lien Debt Standstill Period”), (ii) in the circumstance where holders of Senior Secured Debt take enforcement action in**
relation to a particular guarantor of Second Lien Debt, provided that the applicable holders of Second Lien Debt may only
take the same enforcement action in relation to such guarantor as taken by the applicable holders of Senior Secured Debt
or (iii) if the consent of the majority of the holders of the Senior Secured Debt is obtained as contemplated in the
Intercreditor Agreement.

all Second Lien Debt, the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt may only take certain enforcement action against any
member of the SSN Group or any third-party security provider in respect of liabilities in relation to Senior Subordinated
Debt and/or any Transaction Security (i) if (A) an event of default under any agreement or instrument in respect of Senior
Subordinated Debt is continuing (the occurrence of which has been notified to the relevant representative, agents and/or
trustees of any Senior Secured Debt and Second Lien Debt respectively by the relevant agent and/or trustee of the Senior
Subordinated Debt) and (B) a period of 179 days has elapsed since the date of such notice referred to in (A) (or such earlier
time contemplated in the Intercreditor Agreement) and the applicable event of default referred to in (A) is continuing (a
“Senior Subordinated Debt Standstill Period”), (ii) in the circumstance where holders of Senior Secured Debt or Second
Lien Debt (as the case may be) take enforcement action in relation to a particular guarantor of Senior Subordinated Debt,
provided that the applicable holders of Senior Subordinated Debt may only take the same enforcement action in relation to
such guarantor as taken by the applicable holders of Senior Secured Debt or Second Lien Debt (as the case may be), (iii) in
respect of enforcement action in relation to a particular guarantor of Senior Subordinated Debt that is the subject of an
insolvency event or (iv) if the consent of the majority holders of Senior Secured Debt and the majority holders of Second

Intercreditor Agreement) or grant a power of attorney to the Security Agent to enable it to take such actions.

_Release of security and guarantees—non-distressed disposals_

The Security Agent shall be permitted to release Transaction Security over any asset if, in respect of a disposal of an asset

_Consultation and enforcement of Transaction Security_

Subject to the paragraph below, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or
take any other enforcement action, the agents and/or trustee of the creditors represented in the instructing group concerned
shall consult with each other via their respective agent or directly in the case of any hedge counterparty (other than any
applicable agent and/or trustee in respect of Senior Subordinated Debt) and the Security Agent in good faith about the
instructions to be given by the instructing group for a period of up to 10 business days (or such shorter period as each other
creditor represented in the instructing group shall agree) (the “Consultation Period”), and only following the expiry of a
Consultation Period, shall the instructing group be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
Transaction Security or take any other enforcement action.

The creditors represented in the instructing group shall not be obliged to consult in accordance with the above paragraph
and the instructing group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security
or take any other enforcement action prior to the end of a Consultation Period if:

(a) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event; or

(b) the creditors constituting the instructing group (or the agent(s) and/or trustee of the creditors represented in the
instructing group) determine in good faith (and notify each agent and/or trustee and the Security Agent) that to
enter into such consultation and delay the commencement of enforcement of the Transaction Security could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(i) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Transaction Security; or

(ii) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security.

_Consultation and enforcement of Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security_

If the Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security is being enforced pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Agent shall enforce the Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security in such manner as the majority of the holders of
Senior Subordinated Debt shall instruct or, in the absence of such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may
include taking no action).

_Payment of the Soulte_

If, following any Foreclosure:

(a) in connection with the enforcement of any French law governed Transaction Security, a Soulte is owed by the
Secured Parties to any debtor or third party security provider, that debtor or third-party security provider agrees
that such Soulte shall only become due and payable by the Secured Parties (which have participated in the relevant
Foreclosure pro rata to the amount of liabilities owing to such Secured Parties which have been extinguished); or

(b) in connection with the enforcement of any French law governed Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security, a Soulte
is owed by the relevant holder of Senior Subordinated Debt to any Senior Subordinated Debt independent obligor,
that Senior Subordinated Debt independent obligor agrees that such Soulte shall only become due and payable by
such holders of Senior Subordinated Debt (which have participated in the relevant Foreclosure pro rata to the
amount of liabilities owing to them have been extinguished),

on the earlier of (i) the date which is 12 months after the date on which such Foreclosure occurs and (ii) the final discharge
date.


-----

Any payment of the Soulte to any debtor, third-party security provider or Senior Subordinated Debt independent obligor,
as the case may be, which shall occur prior to the final discharge date, shall be made by the Security Agent in a bank
account in the name of such debtor, third-party security provider or Senior Subordinated Debt independent obligor (as the
case may be) over which Transaction Security or Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security (as applicable) has been granted.
Such Transaction Security document or Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security (as applicable) shall include an mandate
in favor of the Security Agent from the relevant debtor, third-party security provider or Senior Subordinated Debt
independent obligor (as applicable) to make from such pledged bank accounts any payment required to be under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any other secured Debt document.

_Marshalling_

Subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the holders of Senior Secured Debt undertake for the benefit of the
holders of Second Lien Debt and the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt not to enforce any pledge over a financial
instrument account or any other security interest granted in their favor but not in favor of the holders of Second Lien Debt
and the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt by any subsidiaries of the Issuer (the “Lower Senior Securities”).

The senior secured creditors may enforce all or part of the Lower Senior Securities in the following cases:

(a) breach by a holder of Second Lien Debt or a holder of Senior Subordinated Debt of any obligation under the
Intercreditor Agreement resulting in the enforcement of any pledge over a financial instrument account granted
in favor of the holders of Senior Secured Debt, the holders Second Lien Debt and the holders of Senior
Subordinated Debt becoming impossible;

(b) breach by a holder of Second Lien Debt or a holder of Senior Subordinated Debt of any obligation towards the
holders of Senior Secured Debt under the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(c) enforcement of Transaction Security must be carried out in respect of shares of such entities and/or in respect of
such businesses of members of the SSN Group if in the opinion of the Security Agent (acting on behalf of all the
Secured Parties and in accordance with instructions from the Instructing Group) (as confirmed by an opinion from
an independent internationally recognized investment bank appointed by the Security Agent in accordance with
instructions from the Instructing Group (including the holders of Second Lien Debt and the holders of Senior
Subordinated Debt) which should consider the enforcement methods to be used), enforcement of the Lower Senior
Securities is reasonably expected to realize more value within a comparable timeframe for the Secured Parties as
a whole than enforcement of security granted in favor of the holders Senior Secured Debt, the holders of Second
Lien Debt and the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt (taking into account the expected enforcement costs, the
timing of enforcement and sale and the recovery rights of the Secured Parties (including the holders of Second
Lien Debt and the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt)).

_Additional and refinancing indebtedness_

In the event that any debtor incurs any additional indebtedness, or refinances existing indebtedness, that is permitted to be
designated as Senior Secured Debt, Second Lien Debt or Senior Subordinated Debt under the terms of Senior Secured Debt
finance documents, Second Lien Debt finance documents or Senior Subordinated Debt finance documents and entitled to
be secured by the Collateral securing the Notes, the liabilities in respect of such additional or refinancing liabilities, as the
case may be, will share in the proceeds of any enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes or the Existing Senior
Notes, respectively, on a pro rata or lower ranking basis (as applicable) with the applicable group of creditors, provided
that such creditor accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement (if not already a party thereto), and provided further that the
Security Agent other relevant creditors’ representatives shall be empowered to enter into promptly any new security
document or promptly amend or waive any terms of an existing Transaction Security document or Senior Subordinated
Debt Only Security document (as the case may be) and/or promptly release any asset from Transaction Security or Senior
Subordinated Debt Only Security (as the case may be) for this purpose, provided that (i) in relation to the grant of new
Transaction Security or Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security (as the case may be) (over assets, rights or interests, or
classes or types of assets, rights or interests not already the subject of an existing Transaction Security document or Senior
Subordinated Debt Only Security document) only, the obligations set out in this paragraph shall only extend to such


-----

Transaction Security or Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security (as the case may be) that the Security Agent and relevant
creditors’ representative are permitted to take and hold under applicable law and/or the policies and rules of the Security
Agent and relevant creditors’ representative in effect at the time, and (ii) in relation to the release of existing Transaction
Security or Senior Subordinated Debt Only Security (as the case may be), (if legally possible and in the opinion of the
Issuer (acting reasonably) it is commercially feasible to do so and without breach of any term or condition of the relevant
additional financing or refinancing, additional or lower ranking Transaction Security or Senior Subordinated Debt Only
Security (as the case may be) shall be sought instead of release being given in accordance with, and subject to, the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Option to purchase_

Following an acceleration event in respect of the Senior Secured Debt or the enforcement of any Transaction Security, any
holder of Second Lien Debt shall have an option (subject to the conditions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement) to
purchase all (and not only part) of Senior Secured Debt at par.

Following an acceleration event in respect of the Senior Secured Debt or in respect of the Second Lien Debt or the
enforcement of any Transaction Security, the holders of Senior Subordinated Debt holding more than 50% of Senior
Subordinated Debt credit participations shall have an option (subject to the conditions set out in the Intercreditor
Agreement) to purchase all (and not only part) of Senior Secured Debt and the Second Lien Debt at par.

**Finance Leases**

Certain of our subsidiaries are party to finance leases, which are entered mainly in connection with our testing equipment.
Our finance lease amounted to €15.1 million as of June 30, 2021. The finance leases are not subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**Hedging Obligations**

We have entered, and may continue from time to time to enter, into interest rate swap arrangements in order to hedge
against interest rate risk associated with our borrowings subject to floating rates of interest, including the Senior Facilities.
As the Notes and the Existing Senior Notes have a fixed rate of interest, we do not anticipate entering into any interest rate
hedges in connection therewith.

**Description of the Notes**

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the heading “Certain
_Definitions”. For purposes of this “Description of the Notes”, references to the “Issuer” are to CAB and not to any of its_
Subsidiaries, if any. References to “we” or “us” or “our” are to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

The Issuer will issue €350.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 3.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the
“Additional Notes”). The Additional Notes will be issued under the indenture dated as of February 9, 2021 (the
“Indenture”), between the Issuer, the Guarantors, Biogold, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Elavon
Financial Services DAC, as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”), Elavon Financial Services DAC, as transfer agent (the
“Transfer Agent”), Elavon Financial Services DAC, as registrar (the “Registrar”) and Elavon Financial Services DAC,
as security agent (the “Security Agent”), as amended and supplemented by the first supplemental indenture dated March
23, 2021, pursuant to which certain of the Subsidiary Guarantors provided their Note Guarantees, and a second
supplemental indenture to be dated as of the issue date of the Additional Notes (the “Additional Notes Issue Date”). The
Additional Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act. The Indenture is not qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The proceeds of the
offering of the Additional Notes to be issued on the Additional Notes Issue Date will be used by the Issuer as set forth
under the section titled “Use of Proceeds” in this Offering Memorandum.

The Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, pursuant to which the Issuer has previously issued €800.0 million
in aggregate principal amount of 3.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “Existing Senior Secured Notes” and
together with the Additional Notes offered hereby, and any other Additional Senior Secured Notes (as defined below)
subsequently issued under the Indenture, the “Notes”, unless the context otherwise requires). The Additional Notes will
have the substantially same terms and conditions as the Existing Senior Secured Notes and will constitute a single class of
securities with the Existing Senior Secured Notes and any Additional Senior Secured Notes for all purposes under the
Indenture, including, without limitation: waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise
provided for in the Indenture or set forth herein. The Additional Notes will be issued as “Additional Senior Secured Notes”
under the Indenture.

We may, subject to applicable law, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Notes having identical terms and
conditions as the Existing Senior Secured Notes (the “Additional Senior Secured Notes”); provided that, if the Additional
Senior Secured Notes are not fungible with the Existing Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such
Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code or common code, as applicable, from the Existing
Senior Secured Notes. We will only be permitted to issue the Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained
in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”)._

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and refers to the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the
Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define
your rights as Holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the forms of Additional Notes, the Security Documents and
the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Listing and General
_Information”._

The Indenture is subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined
below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding relative ranking of indebtedness and
security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action,
subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall
for amounts received by the Security Agent.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights
under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Notes
have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.


-----

As of the Additional Notes Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the
Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary”,
we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. Any future Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.

**The Notes**

The Notes:

      - are or will be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

      - rank or will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior
Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations;

      - rank or will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including its Guarantee of the Existing Senior Notes;

      - are or will be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation;

      - are or will be guaranteed by the Guarantors as described under “—The Note Guarantees”;

      - are or will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that
are not Guarantors, including obligations owed to trade creditors;

      - will mature on February 1, 2028; and

      - are or will be represented by one or more registered notes in global registered form, but in certain circumstances
may be represented by the relevant Definitive Registered Notes (see “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”).

**The Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

On the Additional Notes Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Existing Senior Notes Issuer, Bio Lam LCD,
Biomer, BPO-Bioépine, LBM Bioesterel, Unilians Biogroup, Astralab, Laborizon Maine Anjou, Laborizon Bretagne,
Laborizon Centre, Biosynergie, Medisch Labo Medina BV, Macsys NV and Centrum voor Medische Analyse BV
(collectively, the “Guarantors”), each of which is an obligor under the Senior Facilities. In addition, if required by the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees,” subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the
future. The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors.

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor:

      - is or will a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

      - rank or will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that
is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee, including (a) Indebtedness Incurred
under the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations and (b) in the case of the Existing Senior Notes Issuer,
Indebtedness Incurred under the Existing Senior Notes;


-----

      - rank or will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee, including its Guarantee of the Existing Senior
Notes;

      - is or will be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that
is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property
and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation; and

      - is or will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor
that are not Guarantors, including obligations owed to trade creditors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee is or will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Note
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance
under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims,
laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can
be guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees
will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied with. The Note Guarantees will be further limited as
required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply to and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favor
of obligations under the Senior Facilities and the Notes where, among other things, any such grant would be restricted by
general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the cost of such grant is disproportionate
to the benefit to the creditors, including the Holders, of obtaining the applicable guarantee. By virtue of these limitations,
Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes,
or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee.

As of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Guarantors in aggregate represented more than 85% of the Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) and approximately 100% of our total assets (including
goodwill).

Claims of creditors of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt
and Guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted
Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted
Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and
each Note Guarantee therefore are or will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred
stockholders of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors (if any). Although the Indenture limits the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of
significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries
of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”._

**_Note Guarantees Release_**

The Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will terminate and release:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the relevant
Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company of such Guarantor), if the sale or other disposition
does not violate the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other
disposition;

(2) upon the sale or disposition (including by way of consolidation, amalgamation, combination or merger) of all or
substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary), if the sale or
other disposition does not violate the Indenture;

(3) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;


-----

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance, covenant
defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge”;_

(5) upon the unconditional release of the Guarantor’s Guarantee under any Indebtedness that triggered such
Guarantor’s obligation to guarantee the Notes under the covenant described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Additional Guarantees”;_

(6) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
relating to the release of a Note Guarantee upon an enforcement sale or other disposal of such Guarantor;

(7) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(8) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization; or

(9) with respect to an entity that is not the successor Guarantor, as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”._

The Note Guarantee of the Existing Senior Notes Issuer will terminate and be released upon the occurrence of an event
described in clauses (4), (6), (7) and (9) above.

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions reasonably requested in writing by the Issuer, including
the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to
effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and
indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee and the Security Agent without the
consent of or liability to the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee or the Security Agent.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Original Issue Date, the Issuer issued €800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Existing Senior Secured
Notes. On the Additional Notes Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Additional
Notes. The Notes will mature on February 1, 2028. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Interest on the Additional Notes will accrue at the rate of 3.375% per annum and will:

      - accrue from (and including) the interest payment date it was most recently paid;

      - be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on February
1, 2022;

      - be payable to the holder of record of the Additional Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related
interest payment date;

      - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months; and

      - be calculated on the nominal amount of the Notes.

Interest on overdue principal, interest, premium or Additional Amounts will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the rate
of interest otherwise applicable to the Notes.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to
be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at
such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Additional Senior Secured Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, the Issuer is permitted to issue Additional_
Senior Secured Notes of the same or different series, which shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes except in
respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate supplied to the Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall bear interest
and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates, the
date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be
payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of holders
thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be denominated and the currency
in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Senior Secured Notes may
be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and conditions
upon which, such Additional Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the denominations
in which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional Senior
Secured Notes; and

(9) any relevant limitation language with respect to Note Guarantees and Security Documents.

All series of Additional Senior Secured Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes
of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for any
applicable series; provided, that if the Additional Senior Secured Notes are not fungible with the Notes originally issued
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN, Common
Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number, as applicable, from the Notes originally issued. Additional Senior
Secured Notes may be designated to be of the same series as the Notes initially issued on the Original Issue Date, but only
if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Notes initially issued on the Original Issue Date,
and shall be deemed to form one series therewith, and references to the Notes shall be deemed to include the Notes initially
issued on the Original Issue Date as well as any such Additional Senior Secured Notes (including the Additional Notes
offered hereby).

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be made by
one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the registered
Holder thereof (being the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive Registered
**Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents. In addition, interest on the**


-----

Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by bank transfer to the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the
register of Holders of Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes” below.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes (including the initial Paying Agent). The initial Paying
Agent is Elavon Financial Services DAC (the “Paying Agent”).The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”)
and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar is Elavon Financial Services DAC and the initial Transfer
Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes
outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf
of the Issuer. A register of the Notes shall also be maintained at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency
between the register of the Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at its registered office, the register
kept by the Registrar shall prevail.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of
the Notes. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange
so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or
any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Additional Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as
follows:

      - each series of Additional Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Additional
Notes Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream; and

      - each series of Additional Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S
Global Notes will, on the Additional Notes Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee
of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification
requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors”. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry
Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream
pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or
Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry
**Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form**
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities
Act.

Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified


-----

**institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise**
in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable
securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is described in this “Description of the Notes” will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry
Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to
which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any,
and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Transfer Agent and the Registrar of instructions relating thereto
and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will
be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant
Senior Secured Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except
as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and
will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Notice
_to Investors”._

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or
exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.
In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to,
among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account
of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any
Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the
Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the applicable Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of the applicable Notes to be redeemed in
part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer
or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the registered
Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Notes is or will be secured by first priority security interests ranking pari passu with the security interests securing the
Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations (subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and certain
Agreed Security Principles) over (i) share capital and other securities of the Issuer held by the Existing Senior Notes Issuer;
(ii) share capital and other securities of Biogold held by the Existing Senior Notes Issuer; (iii) share capital and other
securities of the Issuer held by Biogold; (iv) intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer; (v) bank accounts of the Issuer;
(vi) share capital and other securities of Astralab, Bio Lam LCD, Biomer, LBM Bioesterel, Unilians Biogroup, Laborizon
Maine Anjou, Laborizon Bretagne, Laborizon Centre, BPO-Bioépine, Biosynergie, Medisch Labo Medina BV, Macsys
NV and Centrum voor Medische Analyse BV; (vii) bank accounts of the Guarantors; and (viii) intercompany receivables
owed to the Guarantors.


-----

The Collateral will also secure the liabilities of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior Facilities, certain Hedging
Obligations and any Additional Senior Secured Notes and may also secure certain future Indebtedness, in each case on a
_pari passu basis with the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any_
Collateral will be applied pro rata in repayment of all obligations under the Indenture and the Notes, the Senior Facilities
and any other Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred and secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes and Note Guarantees
pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not
be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders of the Notes. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in
connection with this issuance of Additional Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have
no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or
at all.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”,
certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or
the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles as described under “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement”._

For further information regarding limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to
providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security Documents (the
“Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the Senior Facilities, (b) the
counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders of the Notes under
the Indenture and (d) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, is
established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, which provide, among other things,
that the obligations under the Senior Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations and the Notes are secured equally and ratably
by first priority Security Interests. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement (or Additional Intercreditor
Agreements entered into after the Additional Notes Issue Date), the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”, “—Release of Liens”, “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens”._

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors have granted, or will grant, security over the Collateral to
secure the payment when due and payable of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Notes, the
Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents have been, or will be, entered into by the relevant security
provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties or under the parallel debt as the case may be. When entering
into the Security Documents, the Security Agent has acted in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties
(including itself, the Trustee and the Holders of Notes from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security
Agent acts as a security agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities, the trustee and the holders of Existing Senior Notes
and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, only the Security
Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. As a
consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect
of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of
the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the enforcement of the Collateral. The Indenture and
Security Documents permit the Trustee and/or the agent for any Senior Facilities to instruct the Security Agent to take
enforcement action under the Security Documents (following the occurrence of an event of default under such
Indebtedness, such Indebtedness being declared due and payable and the Trustee having received, where required, the


-----

requisite approval or consent of the holders of such Indebtedness). See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement”._

The Indenture provides that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement,
the Notes and the Note Guarantees, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations
under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect
to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens”.

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors have or will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control
of the Collateral securing the Notes, to freely operate the property and assets constituting Collateral and to collect, invest
and dispose of any income therefrom (including any and all dividends, distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments
in respect of Capital Stock of the Guarantors that is part of the Collateral).

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security
Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances
upon enforcement by the lenders under the Senior Facilities or by certain hedge counterparties. The ability to enforce may
also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance
with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”.

The Security Agent has been appointed under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement to act as agent for certain secured
parties, including the creditors under the Senior Facilities, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the
Collateral and the Holders of the Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such
Indebtedness, including the Security Documents. The creditors under the Senior Facilities and the counterparties to
Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties
and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the
security documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and
(ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed
by the Security Agent on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

In order to establish the relative rights of certain creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors under certain financing
arrangements, including the Notes, the Indenture and the Senior Facilities, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Existing Senior
Notes Issuer, the Existing Senior Guarantors, the agent under the Senior Facilities, the Security Agent, the Trustee and the
trustee under the Existing Senior Notes Indenture have entered into the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement, any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied _pro_
_rata in repayment of all obligations under the Indenture and the Notes, the Senior Facilities and any Indebtedness permitted_
to be incurred and secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes and Note Guarantees pursuant to the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture provides that it will be subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also provides that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements
and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents.


-----

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below)
entered into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor
_Agreements”._

**_Release of Liens_**

The Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to release the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral under
any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;_

(2) upon a release of the Lien (the “Initial Lien”) that resulted in the creation of the Lien (the “Notes Lien”) under
the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” so long as
immediately after the release of the Notes Lien there is no other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the property
and assets that were the subject of the Initial Lien and Notes Lien that would result in the requirement for the
Notes to be secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, such Lien;

(3) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(4) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(5) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance, covenant
defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge”;_

(6) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(7) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization;

(8) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include Collateral, or the sale or
transfer of such property or assets, which may include Collateral, in each case pursuant to a Qualified
Securitization Financing, CIR Financing or Receivables Facility; or

(9) in connection with any disposal of Collateral to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such release
is followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets in a manner
consistent with, and pursuant to applicable formalities under, the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”._

The Senior Notes Issuer and Biogold will be entitled to release the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral directly
owned by it pursuant to the provisions of clauses (4) and (5) above.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with the provisions
of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”.

The Security Agent and the Trustee will take all necessary action reasonably requested in writing by the Issuer to effectuate
any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document subject to
customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent


-----

without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such
release).

**Optional Redemption**

On and after February 1, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ notice (except as permitted under “—Selection and Notice” below), at the following redemption prices
(expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but
not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on February 1
of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**

2024 ........................................................................................................................................... 101.688%

2025 ........................................................................................................................................... 100.844%

2026 and thereafter .................................................................................................................... 100.000%

Except as described below and except as described under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons” the Notes are not
redeemable until February 1, 2024.

Prior to February 1, 2024, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem in the aggregate up to 40% of the original
principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes of the same
series), upon not less than 10 or more than 60 days’ notice, with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Net Cash
Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of
103.375% as of the date of the applicable redemption notice, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any
Additional Senior Secured Notes of the same series) issued under the Indenture remain outstanding after each
such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

Prior to February 1, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a portion of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ notice (except as permitted under “—Selection and Notice” below), at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount of the Notes, plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

In addition, at any time prior to February 1, 2024, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the Issuer may
redeem, during each twelve-month period commencing on the Original Issue Date, up to 10% of the original principal
amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes of the same series)
at a redemption price equal to 103.0% of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers_**

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, all of the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such
tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such holders, then all holders will have been deemed to have consented to
such tender or other offer and the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’


-----

notice following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal
to the price paid to each other holder in such tender offer (excluding any early tender or incentive fee), plus, to the extent
not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts if any, thereon, to, but
excluding, the date of such redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_General_**

We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise. Notice of redemption
will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice”.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as Notes are listed on any securities exchange and
the rules of such an exchange so require, inform the exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate
principal amount of Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the
accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such
record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any such redemption
may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. In addition, the Issuer may provide in any
notice of redemption that payment of the redemption price and the performance of its obligations with respect to such
redemption may be performed by another Person; _provided,_ _however, that the Issuer will remain obligated to pay the_
redemption price and perform its obligations with respect to such redemption in the event such other Person fails to do so.
Notice of any redemption in respect of an Equity Offering may be given prior to completion thereof.

If the Issuer elects to redeem the Notes or portions thereof and, in connection with a satisfaction and discharge or defeasance
of the Indenture in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge”,
requests that the Trustee distribute to the Holders amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, will include accrued and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption) prior to the date fixed for redemption, the
applicable redemption notice will state that Holders will receive such amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee (i) on or
promptly after the date fixed for redemption or (ii) on such earlier payment date as selected by the Issuer.

**_Mandatory Redemption_**

The Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

**_Selection and Notice_**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar will select Notes
for redemption on a pro rata basis or in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable), unless
otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent
nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice
of redemption in accordance with the prevailing rules of the Exchange and in addition to such publication, not less than 10
nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date (except as permitted below), mail such notice to Holders of the Notes
by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar
with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. In the case of Global Notes, such notice of redemption may also be sent
in accordance with the rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable). On and after the redemption date,
interest ceases to accrue on the Notes or the part of the Notes called for redemption.


-----

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion of the
principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the
name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of Global Note, an
appropriate notation will be made on such Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become
due on the date fixed for redemption. If such redemption is subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent,
the related notice may, for the avoidance of doubt, state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed
until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived (provided that in no event shall such date of
redemption be delayed to a date later than 60 days after the date on which such notice was sent, except that redemption
notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance
of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be
rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by
the redemption date so delayed.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
prior written notice (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to
the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and
all Additional Amounts (as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts”), if any, then due and which
will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in
good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change, or amendment to, the existing official written position or the introduction of an official written
position regarding in the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings
(including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published
practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest
payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes (but, in the
case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor
who can make such payment without the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be
avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a
new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become
effective on or after the Original Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction on a date after the Original Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis
to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change or
amendment occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

A notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “—
_Selection and Notice”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days_
prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts if a payment
in respect of the Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional
Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the
foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption
and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and
that the Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and
(b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional


-----

Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s
Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without
further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a “Payor”) in
respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then
required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or any Note Guarantee is made by or on behalf
of the Payor or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or
otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax

(each of clauses (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required by law to be made from any
payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, as applicable, including
payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments)
such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments, after such
withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such additional amounts), will equal the
amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee, as applicable,
in the absence of such withholding or deduction (the “Additional Amounts”); provided, however, that no such Additional
Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between
the relevant Holder or beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or
shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or
beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but for the avoidance of doubt not limited to, being resident for tax
purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent
establishment in or being physically present in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership, holding or sale of such Note or the receipt of any
payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture, a Note Guarantee, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or a Security Document;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner
of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request by the Payor addressed to the Holder, after reasonable
notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be made), to provide certification,
information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence, or identity of the Holder or such
beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to
such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction of, all or part of such Tax
but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or
documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment (where
presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the
Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been
presented on the last day of such 30-day period);


-----

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment under or with respect to
the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, use, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment
or other governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to such Note or Note Guarantee to any Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership (including any entity that is treated as a partnership for applicable tax purposes) or any person other
than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary,
the member of such partnership (or entity treated as a partnership for applicable tax purposes) or the beneficial
owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial
owner held such Note directly;

(7) any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, (the “Code”), as of the Additional Notes Issue Date (or any amended or successor version of
such sections that are substantively comparable), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any official
interpretations thereof, any intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States
with respect to the foregoing and any law, regulation, or official interpretation thereof implementing such
intergovernmental agreement, or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts
evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld to each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes,
or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably
practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made
available at the offices of the relevant Paying Agent.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment
made on any Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so
payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the
relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises or the Payor becomes aware less than
45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as
practicable thereafter). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that
such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a redemption of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional
Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary
taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise,
property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that


-----

arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (and in the case of enforcement, any jurisdiction) from the execution, delivery,
registration, issuance, or enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to, the Notes, any Note Guarantee, the
Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in
connection with a transfer of the Notes after the initial resales by the initial purchasers pursuant to the offering of the
Additional Notes hereby and limited, solely in the case of Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect
thereto, to any such Taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and
(5) through (7) above or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and any transfer by a
Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply _mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is_
organized or incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction
from or through which any payment with respect to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such
Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “Change of Control”, each
Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000 or integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof, if applicable; provided that Notes of €100,000 or less, as the case may be, may only be redeemed
in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the
Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase Notes as described under this heading,
“Change of Control”, in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes
and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption
have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes and given notice of redemption as described
under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date
that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder
of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer
to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the
date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant
interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice
is mailed (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest
on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or
part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change
of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in
order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer
is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.


-----

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so
tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of
Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer.

A Holder willing to tender Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of its election, who
shall in turn notify the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once such tender has been accepted by the
Issuer and notified to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall promptly credit the bank account of such Holder the Change
of Control Payment for such Notes so tendered and deduct the corresponding amount of such Notes from such Holder’s
Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) account.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the
Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar
transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter
a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the
Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the
Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of
Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control and conditioned upon the consummation of such Change
of Control, if a Definitive Agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control
Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of
Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of
factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment
of Indebtedness at the option of each lender under the Senior Facilities.

In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities may not constitute a Change
of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain
events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control.
Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default
under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial
effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be
limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The definition of Change of Control includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is
a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its


-----

Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and
whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a
Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal
amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness); _provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness (including_
Acquired Indebtedness) if, on the date of such Incurrence, after giving _pro forma effect to the Incurrence of such_
Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof):

(a) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; and

(b) to the extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio would have been no greater than 5.75 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (“Permitted Debt”):

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary under any Credit Facility (including in respect
of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder) in an aggregate principal
amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the sum of:

(a) (i) €1,450 million plus (ii) the greater of €386 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA (provided that
any amount of Permitted Debt Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to this
subclause (a)(ii) shall only be available under any revolving facility (including under the Revolving
Credit Facility and any increase in commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility); plus

(b) an amount equal to the greater of €386 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA; plus

(c) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof,
the aggregate amount of fees, accrued and unpaid interest, underwriting discounts, premiums (including
tender premiums) and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred by another provision of this
covenant; provided that, if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to the Notes or a Note Guarantee,
then the Guarantee must be subordinated to the Notes or such Note Guarantee to the same extent as the
Indebtedness being guaranteed; or (b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens”,
Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of
the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) if the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor is the obligor on any such Indebtedness and the obligee is a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, such Indebtedness is unsecured and ((i) except in respect
of intercompany current liabilities Incurred in connection with the cash pooling and other cash
management operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business,


-----

(ii) to the extent legally permitted (the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all
procedures required in the reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to protect
such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the subordination of such
Indebtedness) and (iii) if the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness
that is outstanding for a period of less than 60 days) of the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor owed to
a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor exceeds the greater of €20 million and 0.50% of Total
Assets) expressly subordinated pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Notes, in the case of
the Issuer, or the applicable Note Guarantee, in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor; and

(b) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such
Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and any
sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary,
shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this
clause (3) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Senior Secured Notes) and the related
Note Guarantees and any related “parallel debt” obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(b) any Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness described in
clauses (1), (2) or (4)(a) of this paragraph) outstanding on the Original Issue Date, after giving pro forma
effect to the Transactions (including any Guarantee by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Existing Senior Notes issued on the Original Issue Date and any Parent Debt Contribution relating to
such Existing Senior Notes); and

(c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in clauses (4) and (5) of this
paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant;

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (i) outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or
is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets
and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) Incurred to provide all or a
portion of the funds utilized to consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which any
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that, with respect to this clause (5), at the time of such acquisition or other transaction and after giving_
_pro forma effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness,_

(a) either (i) the Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause
(a) of the first paragraph of this covenant or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than
it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related
Incurrence of Indebtedness; and

(b) to the extent that Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause 5(ii) constitutes Senior Secured Indebtedness,
either (i) the Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause
(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant or (ii) the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
would not be more than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction
and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness;

(including with respect to the Existing Senior Notes and any Parent Debt) (as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer);

assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness, in an aggregate outstanding
principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to this clause (7) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any time the greater of €154 million and 3.86%
of Total Assets;

(8) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims,
self-insurance obligations, performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, completion, appeal, advance payment,

guarantees and warranties provided by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations
or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary course of business or in respect of any governmental requirement, (b) letters
of credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees or other similar instruments or obligations issued or relating to

effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually received by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in
connection with such disposition;

Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (13) and then outstanding, will not exceed 100% of the Net Cash
Proceeds received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Subordinated
Shareholder Funding or Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares or an
Excluded Contribution) or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified
Stock, Designated Preference Shares or an Excluded Contribution) of the Issuer, in each case, subsequent to the
Original Issue Date; provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed
shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and
(10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” to the extent
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds
that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this
clause (13) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment under the first
paragraph or clause (1), (6) or (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” in reliance thereon;_

(14) Guarantees of Indebtedness of Persons other than the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, _provided that the_
maximum principal amount of Indebtedness guaranteed pursuant to this clause (14) does not exceed the greater
of €97 million and 2.43% of Total Assets in the aggregate at any one time outstanding;

(15) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding under local lines of credit or local facilities
(including local bilateral facilities, working capital facilities or overdraft facilities) in an aggregate principal

-----

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the
first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to
time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such
Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) notwithstanding clause (1) above, all Indebtedness outstanding under (i) the Term Loan Facility on the Original
Issue Date and (ii) the Revolving Credit Facility at any time (and, in the case of both (i) and (ii), any refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof) shall be deemed Incurred under clause (1)(a) of the second paragraph of this
covenant and may not be reclassified;

(3) with respect to clauses (1) through (18) (other than clauses (1)(a) and (5)) of the second paragraph of this covenant,
if at any time that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding
item of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall (unless
otherwise elected by the Issuer) be automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to
the first paragraph of this covenant;

(4) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount
of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant
to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (13) or (15) of the second
paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a
Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not
including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(7) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting
such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions
of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(8) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” or “Total Assets” in relation to the second paragraph of
this covenant, Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets, as the case may be, shall be measured at the option of the
Issuer on the most recent date on which new commitments are obtained or the date on which new Indebtedness is
Incurred (in the case of revolving facilities) or the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case of term
facilities) and, in the case of Consolidated EBITDA, for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal
quarters ending prior to such date for which such internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are
available;

(9) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance
Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by
reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets (as applicable) at the time of Incurrence, if
such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets (as applicable) restriction
to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets on the date of such
refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets (as applicable) restriction, as the case may
be, shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums),
defeasance costs and fees in connection with such refinancing;


-----

(10) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the
amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP;

(11) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit
Facility or other revolving credit line, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a “cash sweep” or
“clean down” provision or any provisions that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall
only be deemed for the purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first
Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof; and

(12) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such Indebtedness, such
amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses,
including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses
Incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue
discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional
shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as
Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this
covenant. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of
any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the
case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be
deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred
as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, the Issuer shall be in Default of
this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the
Euro equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Euro shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term
Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro Equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness
Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness
denominated in a currency other than Euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Euro-denominated restriction
to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such
Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such
Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness;
(b) the Euro equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Original Issue Date shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Original Issue Date; and (c) if any such
Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the Euro)
covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in Euro will be
adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

In the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a revolving credit facility,
enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (28) of the
definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including for
purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior
Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of clauses (1) through (18) of the second paragraph above or the first
paragraph above for borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined (i) on the date of such revolving
credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof (or, at the option of the
Issuer, a portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness (in each case, pursuant to any letter,
agreement or instrument, which may be conditional, including as to documentation) and/or (ii) on the date on which such
facility or commitments become available, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Indenture is satisfied with


-----

respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit
and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other
provision of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing or re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the
“Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of the usage
of clauses (1) through (18) above shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined
on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Issuer
may revoke such determination at any time and from time to time.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the
exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred
in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate
applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
refinancing.

Neither the Issuer nor any Subsidiary Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor unless such
Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Note Guarantee, if any,
on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated
in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured
or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of
the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or in respect of the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s
Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary) except:

(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock) or in
Subordinated Shareholder Funding; and

(b) dividends or distributions payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of any such

Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary on no more than a pro rata basis, measured by value);

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Issuer or any direct or indirect

or retirement in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each
case, due within one year of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”);


-----

(4) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease
or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Funding (other than any payment of interest
or premium thereon in the form of additional Subordinated Shareholder Funding); or

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person,

(each such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition, retirement or
Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (5) is referred to herein as a “Restricted Payment”), if at the time
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:

(a) a Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately thereafter therefrom);

(b) the Issuer is not able to Incur an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (a) of the first paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” after giving effect, on a pro forma basis, to such
Restricted Payment; or

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made subsequent to the
Original Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted Payments permitted below by clauses (5)
or (10) of the third paragraph of this covenant, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the third
paragraph of this covenant) would exceed the sum of (without duplication):

(i) 50% of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting period) from the first day of
the fiscal quarter commencing immediately prior to the Original Issue Date to the end of the most recent
fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of such Restricted Payment for which internal consolidated
financial statements of the Issuer are available (or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income is a deficit,
minus 100% of such deficit);

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined in accordance with
the next paragraph) of property or assets or marketable securities, received by the Issuer from the issue
or sale of its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or
Subordinated Shareholder Funding subsequent to the Original Issue Date or otherwise contributed to the

Issuer subsequent to the Original Issue Date (other than (v) Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Capital
Stock in each case sold to a Subsidiary of the Issuer, (w) Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or

the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, (x) Net Cash
Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities to the extent that any Restricted Payment has been
made from such proceeds in reliance on clause (1) or (6) of the third paragraph of this covenant and

stock ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of
its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the Original Issue Date of any Indebtedness that has been converted
into or exchanged for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference
Shares) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding (plus the amount of any cash, and the fair market value of
property or assets or marketable securities received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary upon such
conversion or exchange);

(iv) (a) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined in accordance
with the next paragraph) of property or assets or marketable securities, received by the Issuer or any


-----

Restricted Subsidiary from the disposition of any Unrestricted Subsidiary or the disposition or repayment
of any Investment constituting a Restricted Payment made after the Original Issue Date (other than to
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the
Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary) or (b) to the extent that any Investment that is a Restricted Payment made
after the Original Issue Date is made in an entity that subsequently becomes a Restricted Subsidiary,

Subsidiary or (c) upon the full and unconditional release of a Restricted Investment that is a Note
Guarantee made by the Issuer or one of the Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person after the Original Issue
Date, an amount equal to the amount of such Note Guarantee;

(v) in the event that an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or all of the assets
of such Unrestricted Subsidiary are transferred to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or the Unrestricted

received in cash and the fair market value (as determined in accordance with the next paragraph) of any
property or assets or marketable securities received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in respect
of such redesignation, merger, consolidation or transfer of assets, excluding the amount of any
Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary that constituted a Permitted Investment made pursuant to
clause (11) of the definition of Permitted Investment;

(vi) 100% of any dividends or distributions received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary after the Original
Issue Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary; and

(vii) greater of €58 million and 1.45% of Total Assets,

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for purposes of the preceding_
clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Issuer’s option) included in any of the foregoing clause (iv), (v) or (vi);
_provided further that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded Amounts”) that_
would otherwise be included in the calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the
preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts result from the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds
or property or assets or marketable securities received in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that
would otherwise constitute a Change of Control pursuant to the definition thereof, (2) the purpose of, or the effect
of, the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities was to reduce the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio so that there would be an occurrence of a Specified Change of Control Event
that would not have been achieved without the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or
marketable securities and (3) no Change of Control Offer is made in connection with such Change of Control in
accordance with the requirements of the Indenture.

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence shall be the fair market value

right or privilege in connection with which cash is paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares) for, or out of
the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale or issuance (other than to a Subsidiary of the Issuer) of, Capital
Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares), Subordinated Shareholder
Funding or a substantially concurrent contribution to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified
Stock or Designated Preference Shares or through an Excluded Contribution) of the Issuer; provided, however,
that to the extent so applied, the Net Cash Proceeds, or fair market value of property or assets or of marketable
securities, from such sale of Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Funding or such contribution will be
excluded from clause (c)(ii) of the first paragraph of this covenant;

(3) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition, cancellation or retirement of Preferred
Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary made by exchange for or out of the proceeds of the substantially
concurrent sale of Preferred Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that, in each case,
is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” above, and
that in each case, constitutes Refinancing Indebtedness;

as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its
face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by the Board
of Directors of the Issuer.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or portion thereof)
meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Restricted Payments described in clauses (1) through (22) above,
or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the clauses in the definition of
“Permitted Investment”, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be entitled to divide or classify such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) on the date made or later divide or reclassify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or
portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant (including as a Permitted Investment).

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur, assume or suffer
to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries), whether owned on
the Original Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien
is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not
constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and
the Indenture (or a Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of Guarantors) are directly secured, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles (but without regard to any Agreed Security Principles limiting the types of assets that may be pledged to secure
the Notes and the Note Guarantees under the Indenture), equally and ratably with, or senior in priority to, in the case of
Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such
Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral
Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Holders of Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it
relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens”.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the Incurrence
of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The
“Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with
any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest
in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference
and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies
or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness need not be
permitted solely by reference to one category of Permitted Liens described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant but may be permitted in part under any combination thereof and (B) in the
event that a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of the categories
of Permitted Liens described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the
Issuer shall, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify, such Lien securing each item
of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant and will only be required to include
the amount and type of such Lien or such item of Indebtedness secured by such Lien in one of the clauses of the definition
of “Permitted Liens” and such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness will be treated as being incurred or existing pursuant
to only one of such clauses or pursuant to the first paragraph hereof.


-----

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become
effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any Indebtedness
or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(c) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends_
or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any
standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred
by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or
restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities) and any other
agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Original Issue Date, (b) the Indenture,
the Notes, the Existing Senior Notes, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Documents, the Existing Senior Notes Security Documents or any related security documents or (c) any
other agreement or instrument with respect to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in each case, in effect on
the Original Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any Capital Stock
or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was acquired by or merged,
consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a
Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as
consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer
or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered
into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date, which encumbrance or restriction is not
applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person and its Subsidiaries, or
the property or assets of the Person and its Subsidiaries, so acquired; _provided that, for the purposes of this_
clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Issuer (as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any
Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or
assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Issuer;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument that extends, renews, refinances or replaces
any of the encumbrances or restrictions referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an
“Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred
to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); _provided, however, that the encumbrances and_
restrictions with respect to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument
are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or
other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer);


-----

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is
subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other
contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the Indenture or
securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the Indenture to the extent
such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to such mortgages,
charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capital Lease Obligations permitted
under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property so acquired in the
nature of clause (c) of the preceding paragraph, or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture
agreement that imposes restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets) imposed
pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially
all the Capital Stock or property or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject
to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and instruments
entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or
order, or required by any regulatory authority or any governmental licenses, concessions, franchises or permits,
including restrictions or encumbrances on cash or deposits (including assets in escrow accounts) paid on property;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers, suppliers or
landlords, or as required by insurance, surety or bonding companies or indemnities, in each case, under agreements
or policies entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any Indebtedness
permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Original Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if (A) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement
or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Notes than (i) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities and the Indenture, together with the security
documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Original Issue
Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Issuer) or (B) the Issuer determines at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness that such
encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make
principal or interest payments on the Notes and the Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantors’ ability to comply with their
respective obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(12) restrictions created in connection with a Qualified Securitization Financing, CIR Financing or Receivables Facility
that, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or a responsible accounting or financial officer of
the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified Securitization Financing, CIR Financing or
Receivables Facility;


-----

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens”;

(14) customary provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture agreements,
asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements in the
ordinary course of business (including agreements entered into in connection with a Restricted Investment), which
limitation is applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such agreements; _provided that the Issuer_
determines at the time of the Incurrence of such encumbrances that such encumbrances or restrictions will not
adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes
and the Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantors’ ability to comply with their respective obligations under the Notes, the
Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents; or

(15) customary restrictions included in shareholder agreements relating to non-wholly Owned Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition is not less than the
fair market value of the assets sold (as determined in good faith by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the
Issuer); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset
Disposition consists of:

(a) cash or Cash Equivalents (including any cash or Cash Equivalents received from the conversion, within
180 days of such Asset Disposition, of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of
such Asset Disposition);

(b) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary recorded
on the Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the date of the latest
balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than Subordinated Indebtedness),
as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary remains obligated in respect of such
liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of such Asset Disposition, if the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any
guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result of such Asset Disposition;

(c) Replacement Assets;

(d) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the second paragraph of this
covenant;

(e) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from Persons who are
not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that such Indebtedness (i) has been
extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor and (ii) is not Subordinated Indebtedness of the
Issuer or such Guarantor;

(f) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary having an
aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received
pursuant to this covenant that is at any one time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of €58 million and
1.45% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of each issue of Designated Non-Cash Consideration
being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(g) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (a) through (f) of this clause (2).


-----

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available Cash of the Asset
Disposition, within 450 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt
of such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1)(a) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof;
provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of term
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to such clause (1)(a), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire term
Indebtedness and will cause any related commitment to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the
principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchased or redeemed; (ii) unless included in the preceding clause (1)(i),
prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a senior or pari
passu basis with the Notes and that is not Public Debt at a price of no more than the principal amount of such
applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Additional Amounts and applicable prepayment or
redemption premium, if any, to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption, (iii) prepay,
repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a senior or pari passu basis
with the Notes and that is Public Debt at a price of no more than the principal amount of such applicable
Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Additional Amounts and applicable prepayment or redemption
premium, if any, to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption, provided that the Issuer
shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem pursuant to clause (iii) only if the Issuer makes (at such time or in
compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set
forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to the proportion that
(x) the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the total aggregate principal amount of
Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Indebtedness (other than the
Notes); or (iv) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case
other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary);

(2) purchase the Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100%
of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date) or by making an Asset Disposition Offer to all Holders of the
Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out below) or redeem the Notes as described under “—Optional
_Redemption”;_

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if, after giving
effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a Similar
Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1), (3), (4), (5) or (6) of this
paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application
of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such
investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 450-day period,
if the investment has not been consummated by that date, provided, however, if the assets disposed of constitute
Collateral or constitute all or substantially all of the assets of a Restricted Subsidiary whose Capital Stock has
been pledged as Collateral (in each case, other than assets that only constitute part of the Collateral because such


-----

assets are subject to a floating charge or equivalent Lien), the Issuer shall pledge or shall cause the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary to pledge any Capital Stock or assets (to the extent such assets were of a category of assets
included in the Collateral as of the Original Issue Date) acquired with the Net Available Cash from such
disposition referred to in this covenant in favor of the Notes on a first-priority basis, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in the previous paragraph constitutes “Excess Proceeds”
provided that, if at the time of any Definitive Agreement, put option or similar arrangement in respect of any Asset
Disposition or (at the option of the Issuer) the date on which Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition is received, the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is no greater than 5.0 to 1.0, 50% of the Net
Available Cash from such Asset Disposition shall be deemed not to constitute Excess Proceeds and may be used by the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. Pending the final application
of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such
Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture. The Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
may elect to apply Net Available Cash in accordance with clauses (1) through (8) above prior to receiving such Net
Available Cash; provided that such application is made no earlier than the execution of a Definitive Agreement in respect
of the applicable Asset Disposition. On the 451st day after an Asset Disposition or such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if
the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of €97 million and 2.43% of Total Assets, the Issuer will be
required to make within 30 Business Days thereof an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent
the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral on
a pari passu basis with the Notes, to purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such
Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at
an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer
price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Additional Amounts and applicable prepayment or redemption
premium, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or
the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable).

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining
Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered
in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders,
collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and such
Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of
tendered Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such
Indebtedness not denominated in Euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts
into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period
(as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
The Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make an Asset Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of
the 450-day period mentioned above.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other
than the currency in which the Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed
the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon
converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business
Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business Days after the
termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the
principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to
this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so
validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or


-----

before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to
the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and
Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less
than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable). The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating
that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant.
The Paying Agent shall deliver to the Holders of Notes the purchase price of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
and arrange for the deduction of the appropriate amounts of Notes from such Holders’ accounts with Euroclear or
Clearstream (as applicable). Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry)
by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by
virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any
transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering
of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an “Affiliate
**Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of €19 million and 0.48% of Total Assets unless:**

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the
time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s-length dealings
with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of €39 million and
0.98% of Total Assets, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a
resolution of the majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction
complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

report containing a description of such event.

Following an Initial Public Offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity and/or the listing of such Capital Stock on a
recognized European, United Kingdom or United States stock exchange, the requirements of clause (1), (2) and (3) above
shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange;
_provided that (x) the IPO Entity shall provide financial statements consistent with the requirements of clause (2)(i)above_
for the first three quarterly periods in each fiscal year after the Original Issue Date pursuant to clause (2) and (y) to the
extent such IPO Entity relies on such stock exchange reporting requirements to fulfill the requirements of clauses (1),


-----

(2) and (3) above, a reasonably detailed description of such material differences between the financial statements of such
IPO Entity and the financial statements of the Issuer shall be included for any period after the Original Issue Date.

So long as Notes are outstanding, after furnishing to the Trustee the annual report required by clause (1) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will promptly hold a conference call to discuss such report and the results of
operations for the relevant reporting period.

Any person who requests or accesses such financial information or seeks to participate in any conference calls required by
this covenant may be required to provide its email address, employer name and other information reasonably requested by
the Issuer and represent to the Issuer (to the Issuer’s reasonable good faith satisfaction) that:

(1) it is a holder of the Notes, a beneficial owner of the Notes, a bona fide prospective investor in the Notes, a bona
fide market maker in the Notes affiliated with any Initial Purchaser or a bona fide securities analyst providing an
analysis of investment in the Notes;

(2) it will not use the information in violation of applicable securities laws or regulations;

(3) it will keep such provided information confidential and will not communicate the information to any Person; and

(4) it (a) will not use such information in any manner intended to compete with the business of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries and (b) is not a Person (which includes such Person’s Affiliates) that (i) is principally engaged in a
Similar Business or (ii) derives a significant portion of its revenues from operating or owning a Similar Business.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties, any
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the Notes are not
freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities Act.

The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all reports furnished to the
Trustee on the Issuer’s website. All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP as in effect
on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of GAAP as then in effect) and on a consistent
basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the
reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in GAAP, present earlier periods on a basis
that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer. In
addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or a
group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly
and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant will include a reasonably
detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition
and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act,
or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) of the
Exchange Act with the SEC, or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would
satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
(other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and
procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information,
documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or
15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions
contained in the preceding paragraphs.


-----

For so long as the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation to Holding Company Activities – Existing
_Senior Notes Issuer” are satisfied, the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) may include financial statements of, and_
refer to, the Existing Senior Notes Issuer in lieu of the Issuer, in which case the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3)
shall give a reasonably detailed description of any material differences between the management, business, assets,
shareholding or results of operations or financial condition of the Existing Senior Notes Issuer and the Issuer and include
an unaudited reconciliation of the Issuer’s financial statements or other financial information to the Existing Senior Notes
Issuer’s financial statements or other financial information, as applicable.

The Issuer will, on an ongoing basis, monitor that the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation to
_Holding Company Activities–Existing Senior Notes Issuer” are satisfied by the Existing Senior Notes Issuer. Starting with_
the reporting period in which the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitations to Holding Company
_Activities–Existing Senior Notes Issuer” are no longer satisfied and at any time thereafter, the reports set forth in clauses_
(1), (2), and (3) will include consolidated financial statements and financial information of the Issuer.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries as an
entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”)
will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, the United
Kingdom, any State of the United States of America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of
Canada, or Switzerland and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume (a) by supplemental
indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations
of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and, (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of
the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of such transaction as having been
Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer would be able to
Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (a) of the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the most recently
ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on
which the transaction is consummated would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such
transaction; and

(4) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any is
required in connection with such transaction) comply with the Indenture, and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid
and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee); _provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s_
Certificate as to any matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially
all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by the Issuer
instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a
consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.


-----

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer under
the Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets, the predecessor company will not be released
from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes, as the case may be.

_The Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of
such Guarantor and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries as an entirety or substantially as an entirety,
in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it,

unless:

(a) the other Person is the Issuer, a Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Guarantor
substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease
or other disposal;

(b) (1) either (x) a Guarantor or the Issuer is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and the
Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee) and all obligations of the Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable; and (2) immediately after giving
effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a
Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a Guarantor (in each case
other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) under the heading “—The Guarantors” above shall not_
apply to the extent that compliance with clauses (a) and (b)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any
applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Guarantor that is a
partnership) shareholders of such Guarantor (or, in the case of a Guarantor that is a partnership, directors or shareholders
of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes)
other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to): (i) any
Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary
that is not a Guarantor; (ii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer with and into any Guarantor; provided that if the
Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger on consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the
Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; or (iii) any Guarantor
consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the
legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity,
_provided, however, that clause (3)(b) under the heading “—The Guarantors” shall apply to any such transaction._


-----

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially
all” of the property or assets of a Person.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may implement a
Permitted Reorganization.

made for regulatory reasons; _provided_ _further that such Capital Stock, ongoing concerns or other assets are_
consequently contributed to the Issuer within six months of the Existing Senior Notes Issuer first holding any of
such Capital Stock, ongoing concerns or other assets in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture;

(22) activities undertaken on the Original Issue Date and subsequent activities substantially consistent with activities
undertaken as of the Original Issue Date; and

(23) activities reasonably incidental to the foregoing, and other activities that are de minimis in nature,


-----

_provided that the Existing Senior Notes Issuer is required to own (i) directly at least 89% of the share capital and 44% of_
the voting rights of the Issuer and (ii) directly 100% of the share capital and voting rights of Biogold.

**_Limitations to Holding Company Activities – Biogold_**

Biogold may not carry on any business or own any assets, other than:

(1) the Transactions and entering into and exercising its rights and performing its obligations under the Indenture, the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, in each case to the extent
not prohibited by the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and Indenture;

(2) the ownership of the Golden Share;

(3) holding credit balances in bank accounts and any other assets or property Biogold owns on the Original Issue
Date; and to sell, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all of the foregoing, provided that Biogold shall
not cease to own legally and beneficially and control, in each case, the Golden Share;

(4) ownership of cash, Cash Equivalents and Investment Grade Securities; and

(5) activities reasonably incidental to the foregoing, and other activities that are de minimis in nature.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Original Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and continuing until such
time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of the
Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) “—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”;

(7) the provisions of clause (3) under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”; and

(8) the restrictions under the definition “Unrestricted Subsidiary”.

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will apply again according to their terms from the first day on which a
Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken
prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant
will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension
Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed
to have been outstanding on the Original Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”. In addition, the Indenture will also permit,


-----

without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual
commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as
long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes
no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing that the conditions set forth in
the first paragraph under this caption have been satisfied; provided that no such notification shall be a condition for the
suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever
achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Existing Senior Notes Issuer and Biogold will not, and the Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing
the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the paragraph below, that the Incurrence
of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interests with
respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Existing Senior Notes Issuer and Biogold
will not, and the Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than
the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of
the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Existing Senior Notes Issuer, Biogold and the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the Indenture,
the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (iii) the
applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect,
manifest error or inconsistency therein; (iv) the Existing Senior Notes Issuer, Biogold, the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries may discharge and release Security Interests with respect to the Collateral in connection with the
implementation of a Permitted Reorganization, (v) the applicable Security Documents may be amended in any manner that
does not adversely affect the rights of the Security Agent, the Trustee or the Holders of Notes in any material respects; and
(vi) the Security Interests, and the related Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented
or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the
same assets); _provided, however, that in the case of clause (vi) above, the Security Documents may not be amended,_
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced; unless, contemporaneously with
any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Security Agent either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the
relevant Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the Person
granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications),
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, as so amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced, are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any
limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, to which such Lien or Liens were not otherwise
subject immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security
Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified, secured and/or prefunded to its
satisfaction) consent to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities, any Credit Facility in
excess of €10 million or any other Public Debt, in each case, of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary


-----

is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which such Note Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers
to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary
will provide a Note Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such
a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Note Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security
Principles.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Note Guarantees Release”.
A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release there
is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Original Issue Date and which could not
have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Senior Notes Secured
Guarantor. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note
Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified,
secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture provides that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”
and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (1), Biogold, the
Existing Senior Notes Issuer, the Issuer and the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and, if applicable, the Security
Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor
agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing
Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less
favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Note Guarantees and
priority and release of the Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable,
adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also provides that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and
the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure
any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount
or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
that is subject to any such agreement (including, with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add
Guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including
Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional
Senior Secured Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such
agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. In formulating its opinion on such matters,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate,
including an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—
_Amendments and Waivers”, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment_
to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion
of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture
or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase,
repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of Subordinated Indebtedness; provided, however, that such


-----

transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the
terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into
or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have directed the Trustee and the Security
Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Listing**

The Issuer will use its reasonable efforts to (i) obtain the listing of the Additional Notes on the Official List of the Exchange
and for permission to be granted to deal in the Additional Notes on the Official List of the Exchange as promptly as
practicable after the Additional Notes Issue Date and (ii) maintain such listing and admission to trading for so long as such
Additional Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Issuer is unable to obtain such listing, or if maintenance of such
listing becomes unduly onerous, it will, prior to the delisting of the Additional Notes from the Official List of the Exchange,
use its reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such Additional Notes on another “recognised stock exchange”
as defined in section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom.

**Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Transactions**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in connection with any
acquisition, disposition, merger, Joint Venture, investment or other similar transaction where there is a time difference
between commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of Incurrence of Indebtedness, Restricted Payments
and Permitted Investments), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall,
at the option of the Issuer, be the date the Definitive Agreement for such acquisition, disposition, merger, Joint Venture,
investment or similar transaction are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to such acquisition, disposition, merger, Joint Venture, investment or similar transaction and the other
transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the ability to
consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio). For the
avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio
(including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of
determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to
have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transactions are
permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or
related transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into
such Definitive Agreement, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date of such Definitive Agreement and be outstanding thereafter for
purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the
consummation of such transactions.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable, continued for
30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the Indenture
when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or
otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation”;_


-----

(4) failure by Biogold, the Existing Senior Notes Issuer, Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 days
after written notice to the Issuer by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture, the Notes, the Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be
secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or the
payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary), other than Indebtedness owed to the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the
Original Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the
expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration provision”),

and in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other
such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
aggregates the greater of €77 million and 1.93% of Total Assets or more;

(6) other than on a solvent basis, certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of Biogold, the Existing
Senior Notes Issuer, the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken together
(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary
(the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of
the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to
pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of €77 million and 1.93% of Total Assets (exclusive of
any amounts for which a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability), which judgments are not paid,
discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(8) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other
than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of the
greater of €19 million and 0.48% of Total Assets for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations
under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security
interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and any such Default continues
for 10 days (the “security default provision”);

(9) any Note Guarantee of the Existing Senior Notes Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Note Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or
unenforceable in a judicial proceeding and any such Default continues for 30 days, or any Guarantor denies or
disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Note Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days (the
“guarantee provision”); and

(10) any of the following events or circumstances occurs: (i) any change to the terms and conditions of the Golden
Share or the by-laws of the Issuer affecting the financial rights attached to the Golden Share or (ii) any redemption,
cancellation, repurchase, transfer or assignment of the Golden Share (other than any transfer to the Security Agent
as a result of enforcement of the Collateral) or (iii) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply
with clause (iv) of the proviso of clause (26) of the definition of Asset Disposition or clause (ii) of the proviso
included in the definition of Sequenced Acquisition Permitted Payment.


-----

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee,
by notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture, by
written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal
of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such
a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event
of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under the definition of
Events of Default has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically
annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied
or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall
have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the
annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that
became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued
and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act
on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as
provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents
and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by notice to the Trustee may,
on behalf of all Holders, waive any past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of
principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, the waiver of which shall require the consent of Holders holding
not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes affected) and rescind any acceleration with respect
to the Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request
or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security and/or prefunding
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal
or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the
remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security, indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee against
any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of such
security, indemnity and/or prefunding; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that,
in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising
any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture provides that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would
use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or
the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve
the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to


-----

indemnification, prefunding and/or other security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and
expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have
no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture. The Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and
is continuing and the Trustee is given notice in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of
the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being so notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment
of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee
determines in good faith that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate
indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The
Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of
which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to
take in respect thereof.

The Indenture provides that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another
default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a
required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default
or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain
_Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall_
be deemed to be cured upon the delivery prior to acceleration in respect of the relevant breach of any such report required
by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period
specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture provides for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the
Trustee is indemnified, secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain
actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action,
notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent
of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default
or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Notes); provided that, if any amendment, supplement, other modification or waiver will only amend,
supplement or waive one series of the Notes, only the consent of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes of such series shall be required. However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or,
in the case of clauses (7) and (9) of this paragraph, 80%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes affected,
an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder or, if any amendment, waiver
or other modification will only amend, supplement, modify or waive one series of the Notes, without the consent of Holders
holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clauses (7) and (9) of this paragraph, 80%) of the then outstanding aggregate
principal amount of such series of Notes affected, with respect to any such series of Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may be
redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in a currency other than that stated in the Note;


-----

(6) impair the right of any Holder of any outstanding Note to bring suit for the enforcement of any payment of
principal of, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes on or after the
due dates therefor;

(7) release all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other
than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted
from such acceleration);

(9) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the Note Guarantees or the Indenture,
except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in this
sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
under any Notes Document;

(3) to add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon Biogold, the Existing Senior Notes Issuer, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) to make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee, the Security Agent or the
Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights of or benefits to the Trustee, the Security Agent or any of the
Holders in any material respect under the Notes Documents;

(5) to make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the
Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional
_Guarantees”, to add Note Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes,_
or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien (including
the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the
Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the Indenture,
the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this “Description
_of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended to be a verbatim_
recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor trustee or security agent pursuant to the requirements
thereof or to provide for the accession by the trustee or security agent to any Notes Document;


-----

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor of the
Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior Facilities Agreement, in any property which
is required by the Security Documents or the Senior Facilities Agreement to be mortgaged, pledged or
hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent
necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of
such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest” is complied with;_

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”;

(11) to provide for or facilitate the issuance of uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;
_provided that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for the purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code,_
or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are not treated as “registration-required obligations” under
Section 163(f)(2)(A) of the Code;

(12) to comply with the rules of any applicable depositary; or

(13) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes as
permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of the Notes or, if Incurred in
compliance with the Indenture, Additional Senior Secured Notes; provided that compliance with the Indenture as
so amended would not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable
securities laws and regulations and such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of Holders
to transfer Notes.

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely on such evidence as it deems
necessary, without further inquiry, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel. The consent of the Holders is
not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It
is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver
under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered
invalid by such tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment authorized by clause (3)
above to add a Guarantor under the Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the
accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor
and (iii) the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the
Issuer and the Trustee.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver
or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling, or controlled by, or under
direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding; provided that, for
the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only
Notes which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the Notes and the Indenture
(“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including
those respecting the defeasance trust (as defined below), the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of
the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment
and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option,


-----

the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its, the Existing Senior Notes Issuer’s and the Restricted Subsidiaries’ obligations
under the covenants described under “Certain Covenants” (other than clause (1) and (2) under “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants_
described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a Payment Default, the cross
acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to any Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default
provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “—Events of Default” (“covenant
**defeasance”).**

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant
defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because
of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the
Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with
respect to clause (1) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”),
(4), (5), (6) (with respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, when taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary), (7), (8) or (9) under “—Events of Default”.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”) with the
Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in Euro or
Euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient for the payment of principal,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, provided that, if requested by the
Issuer, the Trustee will distribute any amounts deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the Stated Maturity or redemption
date, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders and beneficial owners of the relevant Notes
will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling received by the Issuer
from, or published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering,
delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions and qualifications), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with; and

(4) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either
defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to
surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all
outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen
or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have
been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their
Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably


-----

satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in its name, and at the expense, of
the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed
(as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose), money or Euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a
combination thereof, as applicable in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not
previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit
(in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be;
(3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered
irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes
at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be (subject to the succeeding sentences), and (5) the Issuer has
delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (provided that such counsel may not be an
employee of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries) each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and
_Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with;_
_provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with_
the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)). The Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or
appointed by the Issuer and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, acting for the Trustee for this purpose) shall distribute
any amounts deposited pursuant to this paragraph to the Holders on the date specified in writing (in the above referenced
notice of redemption or Officer’s Certificate or otherwise) by the Issuer at least two Business Days prior to the specified
date of distribution, which date of distribution may in the Issuer’s discretion be prior to the Stated Maturity or the
redemption date, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the
redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other
premium on such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented by a Global Note deposited with a depositary for a
clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding Senior Secured Book-Entry Interests as participants of such
clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of the clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such,
shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes Documents or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and
releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may
not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver
is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture provides that, except during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture.
During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the
Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive
rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an
obligation or duty.

The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain
payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or
otherwise. The Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Security Agent and any other agent will
be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and replaced. Such terms will include,
among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of then
outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time
(a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes
insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less
than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee. Any removal
or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.


-----

The Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, Taxes or expenses Incurred
without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

Notices, warnings, summonses and other communications to the holders of the Notes from the Trustee shall be sent via
Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) with a copy to the Issuer. Any such notice or communication shall be deemed to
be given or made when sent from Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable). The Issuer’s written notifications to the holders
of Notes shall be sent through Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable), with a copy to the Trustee and the Exchange (to
the extent required by the rules of the Exchange).

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will be
prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the
payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity**

The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer with respect to the Notes is Euro. Any amount
received or recovered in a currency other than Euro, (whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of
a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the holder (or, if
applicable, the Trustee) in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer will constitute a discharge of the
Issuer only to the extent of the Euro amount, which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or
recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on
that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount, expressed to
be due to the recipient under any Note, the Issuer will indemnify the recipient against any loss sustained by it as a result.
In any event the Issuer will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated
restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent for purposes hereof that is denominated in a currency other than Euro shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-Euro amount is Incurred or made,
as the case may be.

**Certain Information Reporting Provisions**

**_Mutual Undertaking Regarding Information Reporting and Collection Obligations_**

Each Party to the Indenture (a “Party”) shall, within ten business days of a written request by another Party, supply to that
other Party such forms, documentation and other information relating to it, its operations, or the Notes as that other Party
reasonably requests for the purposes of that other Party’s compliance with Applicable Law and shall notify the relevant
other Party reasonably promptly in the event that it becomes aware that any of the forms, documentation or other
information provided by such Party is (or becomes) inaccurate in any material respect; provided, however, that no Party
shall be required to provide any forms, documentation or other information pursuant to this paragraph to the extent that:
(i) any such form, documentation or other information (or the information required to be provided on such form or
documentation) is not reasonably available to such Party and cannot be obtained by such Party using reasonable efforts; or
(ii) doing so would or might in the reasonable opinion of such Party constitute a breach of any: (a) Applicable Law;
(b) fiduciary duty; or (c) duty of confidentiality. For purposes of this paragraph, “Applicable Law” shall be deemed to
include (i) any rule or practice of any competent regulatory, prosecuting, Tax or governmental authority by (“Authority”)
which any Party is bound or with which it is accustomed to comply; (ii) any agreement between any Authorities; and
(iii) any agreement between any Authority and any Party that is customarily entered into by institutions of a similar nature.


-----

**_Notice of Possible Withholding Under FATCA_**

The Issuer shall notify the Paying Agent in the event that it determines that any payment to be made by the Paying Agent
under the Notes is a payment which could be subject to any withholding or deduction required pursuant to an agreement
described in section 1471(b) of the Code, or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any
regulations or agreements thereunder, any official interpretations thereof, or any law implementing an intergovernmental
approach thereto (“FATCA Withholding”) if such payment were made to a recipient that is generally unable to receive
payments free from FATCA Withholding, and the extent to which the relevant payment is so treated, provided, however,
that the Issuer’s obligation under this paragraph shall apply only to the extent that such payments are so treated by virtue
of characteristics of the Issuer, the Notes, or both.

**_Paying Agent Right to Withhold_**

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to make a deduction or withholding
from any payment which it makes under the Notes for or on account of any Taxes, if and only to the extent so required by
Applicable Law, in which event the Paying Agent shall make such payment after such deduction or withholding has been
made and shall account to the relevant Authority within the time allowed for the amount so deducted or withheld or, at its
option, shall reasonably promptly after making such payment return to the Issuer the amount so deducted or withheld, in
which case, the Issuer shall so account to the relevant Authority for such amount. For the avoidance of doubt, FATCA
Withholding is a deduction or withholding which is deemed to be required by Applicable Law for the purposes of this
paragraph.

**_Issuer Right to Redirect_**

In the event that the Issuer determines in its sole discretion that any deduction or withholding for or on account of any
Taxes will be required by Applicable Law in connection with any payment due to any of the agents on any Notes, then the
Issuer will be entitled to redirect or reorganize any such payment in any way that it sees fit in order that the payment may
be made without such deduction or withholding provided that, any such redirected or reorganized payment is made through
a recognised institution of international standing and otherwise made in accordance with the Indenture. The Issuer will
promptly notify the agents and the Trustee of any such redirection or reorganization. For the avoidance of doubt, FATCA
Withholding is a deduction or withholding which is deemed to be required by Applicable Law for the purposes of this
paragraph.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States, any judgment
obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with respect to the payment of
principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to
the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The Note
_Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations_
_or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of_
_the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes, the Issuer
and the Guarantors in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of
Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement, is governed by the law of England and


-----

Wales. The Security Documents are and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of various
jurisdictions.

acquisition or (3) of a Person at the time such Person merges with or into or consolidates or otherwise combines with the

_pro forma effect shall be given to Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage_

For the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” for any basket or ratio under the Indenture, Consolidated

ordinary working capital borrowings) subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is made (the “Calculation Date”), then the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio will be
calculated giving pro forma effect (as determined by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer) (including
in respect of anticipated cost savings and expense and cost reduction and expense and cost synergies reasonably anticipated
to be taken within 24 months) to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance

paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” (other than clause (5)(ii) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or (ii) the discharge on the Calculation
Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to the provisions
described in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”.

In addition, for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio:

or any of its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, and including all related financing transactions and
including increases in ownership of Restricted Subsidiaries, during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent


-----

to such reference period and on or prior to the Calculation Date, or that are to be made on the Calculation Date,
will be given pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the
Issuer), including in respect of anticipated cost savings and expense and cost reduction and expense and cost
synergies reasonably anticipated to be taken within 24 months, as if they had occurred on the first day of the
four-quarter reference period; provided that, if a Definitive Agreement has been entered into with respect to a
Purchase that is part of the transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for
such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect to such Purchase (including anticipated cost savings
and expense and cost reduction and expense and cost synergies reasonably anticipated to be taken within 24
months) as if such Purchase had occurred on the first day of such period, even if the Purchase has not yet been
consummated as of the date of determination;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued operations, as determined
in accordance with GAAP, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating unit
(and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis
as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period (taking into account anticipated cost savings resulting
from any such disposal, as determined by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer);

(3) the Fixed Charges attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and
operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and ownership interests therein)
disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition occurred on
the first day of such period, but only to the extent that the obligations giving rise to such Fixed Charges will not

synergies and cost savings and (ii) the aggregate amount of any anticipated cost savings and expense and cost reduction
and expense and cost synergies shall not at any time exceed an amount equal to 25% of Consolidated EBITDA for the four
most recent fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of determination for which internal consolidated financial statements of

Leverage to (y) the aggregate amount of Consolidated EBITDA for the period of the four most recent fiscal quarters ending

(excluding the notes thereto). For purposes of determining Total Assets, pro forma effect shall be given to the calculation

Any such designation by the Board of Directors of the Issuer shall be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a

**Book-Entry; Delivery and Form**

**General**

The Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially
be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (each, a “Rule 144A Global Note”).
The Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented
by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (each, a “Regulation S Global Note” and, together
with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Additional Notes Issue
Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Notes may only be offered or sold within the United States pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (“Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of interests in
the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or
persons who hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on
behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective
depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive
certificated form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained in the book-
entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be issued
only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain
states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in
definitive certificated form (“Definitive Registered Notes”). The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own,
transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests
will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the owners or “holders” of
Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or the common
depositary’s nominee), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture
governing the Notes. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-
Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the Indenture.

Neither we, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, nor any of their respective affiliates will
have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will
distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests
in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption
price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by
Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof).
We understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be
redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis
(with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate unless otherwise required
by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less
than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.


-----

**Payments on Global Notes**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, and
interest) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common depositary or its nominee
for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary
procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any
present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law
and as described under “Description of the Notes”. If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to
the extent described under “Description of the Notes” above, we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order
for the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or
withholding to equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global
Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through
such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of
their respective agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (the common depositary for Euroclear or
Clearstream or its nominee) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective
agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for: any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, or Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant;
payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to payments made on
account of a Book-Entry Interest; or Euroclear, Clearstream, or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such
participants as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “stock name”.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will be
paid through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only
at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests are credited and only in respect of
such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of
any other action in respect of the Global Notes.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and Clearstream
rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive
Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in jurisdictions that require physical delivery of
securities or to pledge such Notes, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with
the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set out in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will have a legend to the effect set out under “Transfer Restrictions”. Book-Entry Interests in the Global
Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under “Transfer Restrictions”.


-----

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S Book-
Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other
exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes
is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in
accordance with the Notice to Investors described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable
securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S
Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the relevant Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned
Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all
transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long
as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes (i) if
Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a successor
depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days; or (ii) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such an exchange
in writing delivered through either Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture and
enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such
Note by surrendering it to the Registrar or the Transfer Agent. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a
holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will
be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance
of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no
Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 will be issued. We will bear the cost of preparing, printing,
packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes.

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of 15 calendar days
preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any date fixed for redemption of the Notes or
(iii) any date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. Also, we are not required to register the transfer or
exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in
connection with a change of control offer or asset disposition offer. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered
Note, the Trustees, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture. We may require a holder to pay any taxes and fees
required by law and permitted by the Indenture and the Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Note has been lost,
destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered to the Registrar or
Transfer Agent or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustees (or an authentication agent appointed
by it) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustees’ and our requirements are met. The Issuer
or the Trustees may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond
sufficient in the judgment of both to protect themselves, the Trustees or the Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar


-----

appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced.
The Issuer may charge for any expenses incurred by us in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and
payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer, pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer in
their discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive
Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes only after the
transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect
that such transfer will comply with the Notice to Investors applicable to such notes. Please see “Transfer Restrictions”.

Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at the
office of the Issuer’s paying agent in London.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar and their
respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person
will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Notes will be evidenced through registration from
time to time at the registered office of the registrar, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests
may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. We
provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations
and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither
we, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those
operations or procedures.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for
participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their
respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and
borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets.
Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others
such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear
or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants
and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not
participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by
the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical
delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be
limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions
attributable to the Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Additional Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange.
Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary
way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.


-----

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests
in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to
perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None
of us, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility for the performance
by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the
rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Additional Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-
Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day
following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds.
Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry
Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the
desired value date.


-----

**Transfer Restrictions**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the Additional_
_Notes offered hereby._

The Additional Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any

Accordingly, the Additional Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers (as

Regulation S (and only to investors who, if resident in a Member State of the EEA, are not retail investors, defined as a

regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA.

We have not registered and will not register the Additional Notes or the Guarantees under the U.S. Securities Act and,
therefore, the Additional Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from,
or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Accordingly, we are offering and
selling the Additional Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

      - in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers”, commonly referred to as “QIBs”, as defined in Rule 144A
in compliance with Rule 144A; and

      - to persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S.

We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Additional Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to
and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Additional Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under the
U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable state securities laws, and that the Additional Notes are being offered
for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities law,
including sales pursuant to Rule 144A, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred
except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable state
securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in
compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) It is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) of the Issuer or acting on behalf of the Issuer and it is either:

Registrar or the Initial Purchasers, or any person representing any of them, have made any representation to it
with respect to the offering or sale of any Notes other than the information contained in this offering memorandum,

us, the Issuer and its subsidiaries and the Additional Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection with its
decision to purchase any of the Additional Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request
information from, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any

of this offering memorandum. It acknowledges that we, and not the Initial Purchasers, have ultimate authority
over the statements contained in this offering memorandum, including the content of those statements and whether
and how to communicate them.

(4) It is purchasing the Additional Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is
acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection

or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Benefit Plan Investor (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied as
a primary basis in connection with its decision to invest in the Issued Notes, and they are not otherwise undertaking
to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the Benefit Plan
Investor or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the Benefit Plan Investor’s acquisition of the Issued Notes; and
(ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Issued Notes.

(7) Each holder of Notes issued in reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A Notes”) agrees on its own behalf and on
behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Rule 144A
Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the
date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is one year after the later of the Original Issue Date and the
last date on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates was the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) only
(i) to the Issuer, the Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been

account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and in compliance with any applicable state securities
laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustees’ rights
prior to any such offer, sale or transfer pursuant to clause (v) to require that a certificate of transfer in the form

If it purchases Notes, it will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to holders of
beneficial interests in Notes as well as to holders of these Notes.

(8) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers Notes notice of any restrictions on transfer of such
Notes. It acknowledges that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or transfer any Notes
acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuer and the Registrar that the restrictions

the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Additional Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the
Additional Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the
Additional Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan of Distribution”.

(11) It acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or sale of the Additional
Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with

or to whom the Additional Notes are otherwise made available will be deemed to have represented, warranted,
acknowledged and agreed to and with each initial purchaser and the Issuer that it is not a retail investor in the
EEA. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of
the following: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the
meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client

**Tax Considerations**

**Certain French Tax Consequences**

The following is a summary of certain French withholding tax considerations pertaining to the ownership of the Additional
Notes. Comments which are included therein are reported only for information purposes and do not aim at giving a
complete analysis of the tax rules that may affect the Issuer, the Additional Notes or the investors. This summary is based
on provisions of French tax laws and regulations, as in force and applied by the French tax authorities at the date of this
offering memorandum, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect, or to different interpretations.
Accordingly, no opinion is expressed herein with regard to any system of law other than the laws of France as applied by
French courts as of the date of this offering memorandum. Any investor contemplating to acquire the Additional Notes
should therefore consult its own tax adviser about the tax consequences that may arise for it as a result of the acquisition,
the ownership, the disposal or the redemption of the Additional Notes.

**_Withholding taxes on payments made outside France_**

Holders of the Additional Notes who concurrently hold shares of the Issuer may also be impacted by other rules not
described in this section.

Payments of interest and assimilated revenues made by the Issuer with respect to the Additional Notes will not be subject
to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code unless such payments are made outside
France in a non-cooperative State or territory (État ou territoire non coopératif) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of
the French Tax Code (a “Non-Cooperative State”) other than those States or territories mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the
same Article 238-0 A, irrespective of the holder’s fiscal domicile or registered headquarters. If such payments are made
outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those States or territories mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0
A of the French Tax Code, a 75% withholding tax is applicable to such payments (subject to certain exceptions and to more
favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty) by virtue of Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code. The list of
Non-Cooperative States is published by a ministerial executive order (arrêté) which is updated each year.

Furthermore, according to the third and fourth paragraphs of Article 238 A of the French Tax Code, interest and assimilated
revenues with respect to the Additional Notes will not be deductible from the Issuer’s taxable result if they are paid or
accrued to persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account held in a financial institution
established in such a Non-Cooperative State (the “Deductibility Exclusion”). Under certain conditions, any such non-
deductible interest and assimilated revenues may be re-characterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et
_seq. of the French Tax Code, in which case they may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of_
the French Tax Code at (i) the standard corporate income tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the second paragraph of
Article 219-I of the French Tax Code (i.e. 26.5% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and 25% for fiscal
years beginning as from January 1, 2022) for payments benefiting legal persons who are not French tax residents, (ii) a rate
of 12.8% for payments benefiting individuals who are not French tax residents or (iii) a rate of 75% for payments made
outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax
Code (in each case subject to certain exceptions and to more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code
nor, to the extent that the interest and assimilated revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or
exaggerated amount, the Deductibility Exclusion and the related withholding tax set out under Article 119 _bis 2 of the_
French Tax Code that may be levied as a result of such Deductibility Exclusion will apply in respect of the Additional
Notes if the Issuer can prove that the main purpose and effect of the issue of the Notes was not that of locating the interest
and assimilated revenues in a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”). Pursuant to the administrative guidelines
published by the French tax authorities regarding this legislation (BOI-INT-DG-20-50-30 dated 24/02/2021, § 150 and
BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20 dated 24/02/2021, § 290 (the “BOFIP”)), the Additional Notes will benefit from the Exception
without the Issuer having to provide any evidence supporting the main purpose and effect of the issue of the Additional
Notes, and accordingly will be able to automatically benefit from the Exception (the “Safe Harbor”), if the Additional
Notes are:


-----

      - offered by means of a public offering within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French Monetary and Financial
Code for which the publication of a prospectus is mandatory or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a state other
than a Non-Cooperative State (for this purpose, an “equivalent offering” means any offering requiring the
registration or submission of an offering document by or with a foreign securities market authority); and/or

      - admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or multilateral financial instruments trading facility
provided that such market or facility is not located in a Non-Cooperative State and that such market is operated
by a market operator, an investment services provider, or by such other similar foreign entity that is not located
in a Non-Cooperative State; and/or

      - admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities delivery and payment
systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, or of one or
more similar foreign depositaries or operators provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a Non-
Cooperative State.

The Additional Notes issued by the Issuer under this offering memorandum qualify as debt securities under French
commercial law. Since the Additional Notes will be admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of Euroclear and
Clearstream, i.e. both securities delivery and payment systems operators within the meaning of Article L. 561-2 of the
French Monetary and Financial Code which are not located in a Non-Cooperative State, payments made by the Issuer in
respect of the Additional Notes to their holders will fall under the Safe Harbor and will thus not be subject to the withholding
tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code, as construed by the French tax authorities under the BOFIP.
Moreover, under the same conditions, pursuant to the BOFIP and to the extent that the interest and other assimilated
revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, interest and assimilated revenues
paid by the Issuer on the Additional Notes should not be subject to the Deductibility Exclusion and, as a result, should not
be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code solely on account of their being
paid on an account held in a financial institution established in a Non-Cooperative State or accrued or paid to persons
established or domiciled in a Non-Cooperative State.

**_Withholding taxes on payments made to individuals fiscally domiciled in France_**

Pursuant to Article 125 A I of the French Tax Code, when the paying agent (établissement payeur) is established in France
and subject to certain exceptions, interest and similar income received by individuals fiscally domiciled (domiciliés
_fiscalement) in France may be subject to a 12.8% withholding tax, which is deductible from their personal income tax_
liability in respect of the year in which the payment has been made. Social contributions (CSG, CRDS and solidarity levy)
are also levied by way of withholding at an aggregate rate of 17.2% on such interest and similar income received by
individuals fiscally domiciled (domiciliés fiscalement) in France, subject to certain exceptions.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Additional Notes by a U.S. Holder or Non-U.S. Holder (each as defined below), who purchases the
Additional Notes in the Offering at the issue price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, but does not
purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. This summary is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations
thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No
rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters
discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Additional Notes or that any such position would
not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light
of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws,
such as financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities,
U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, grantor trusts, tax-exempt organizations, regulated


-----

investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities (or investors in such
entities), persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons holding the Additional Notes as part of a “straddle”, “hedge”,
“conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction and persons who own, directly, indirectly, or constructively ten
percent (10%) or more of the Issuer’s stock. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who hold the Additional Notes
as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. This discussion does not address any tax consequences
other than U.S. federal income tax consequences and does not address the Medicare tax on certain investment income, the
base erosion and anti-abuse tax or special tax accounting rules that apply as a result of gross income with respect to the
Additional Notes being taken into account on an applicable financial statement. Further, this discussion does not address
any consequences that may result pursuant to Treasury regulations promulgated under section 385 of the Code with respect
to any holder that is considered related to the Issuer for the purposes of such regulations.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of an Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a
corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any
estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court
within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S.
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust
as a U.S. person. A “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Notes that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership.

If any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Additional Notes, the tax treatment of
a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the
partnership. A holder that is a partnership, and partners in such partnerships, should consult their tax advisors regarding
the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Additional Notes. The discussion below assumes
that the Additional Notes will be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Prospective purchasers of the Additional Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of
holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax
considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws and state, local, foreign
or other tax laws.

**_Additional Amounts_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Additional Notes—Optional Redemption”, and _“Description of the_
_Additional Notes—Change of Control”), we may be obliged to pay amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on the_
Additional Notes. Our obligation to pay such excess amounts may implicate the provisions of the Treasury regulations
relating to “contingent payment debt instruments”. Under these regulations, however, one or more contingencies will not
cause a debt instrument to be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument if, as of the relevant Issue Date, such
contingencies in the aggregate are considered “remote” or “incidental”. We believe and intend to take the position that the
foregoing contingencies should be treated as remote and/or incidental. Our position is binding on a holder, unless the holder
discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. However, this determination is inherently
factual and we can give you no assurance that our position would be sustained if challenged by the IRS. A successful
challenge of this position by the IRS could require a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation to accrue ordinary
income at a rate that is higher than the stated interest rate and to treat any gain recognized on a sale or other taxable
disposition of a Note as ordinary income, rather than capital gain. The remainder of this disclosure assumes that the
Additional Notes will not be considered contingent payment debt instruments. Prospective purchasers are urged to consult
their own tax advisers regarding the potential application to the Additional Notes of the contingent payment debt regulations
and the consequences thereof.

**_Fungibility of the Additional Notes_**

The Additional Notes may be issued with original issue discount (‘‘OID’’) for U.S. federal income tax purposes as
described below under “Original Issue Discount.” If the Additional Notes are issued with more than de minimis OID, then
the Additional Notes and the Original Notes will constitute separate issues for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, in


-----

that case, the Additional Notes will trade separately from the Original Notes under different ISIN numbers. In such case,
the discussion below under “Premium” should not apply.

If the Additional Notes are issued only with de minimis or no OID, then we intend to treat the Additional Notes as being
issued in a “qualified reopening” for U.S. federal income tax purposes and thus as part of the same issue as the Original
Notes. Under this treatment, all of the Notes would be fungible, deemed to have the same issue date and the same issue
price as the Original Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Additional Notes are fungible with the Original
Notes, then certain additional U.S. federal income tax consequences may result as discussed below under “Premium”.

**_Pre-Issuance Accrued Interest_**

Whether or not the Additional Notes are fungible with the Original Notes, we intend to take the position that a portion of
the first payment on the Additional Notes equal to the pre-issuance accrued interest would be treated as a return of the pre-
issuance accrued interest rather than an amount payable on the Additional Notes, and a portion of the purchase price of the
Additional Notes would be attributable to the amount of interest accrued prior to the date the Additional Notes are issued.
The portion of the first stated interest payment equal to the pre-issuance accrued interest should be excluded from income
(except that a U.S. Holder generally would be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss, as discussed below, in
an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the pre issuance accrued interest at the time of
purchase and at the time the payment of such pre issuance accrued interest is received, as determined based on the exchange
rate in effect on each such date). Amounts treated as pre issuance accrued interest should be excluded from the U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Additional Notes and should not reduce a U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
Additional Notes when received. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income
tax treatment of any pre-issuance accrued interest on the Additional Notes.

**_Payments of Interest_**

Except as described above with respect to pre-issuance accrued interest, stated interest on the Additional Notes (including
any non-U.S. tax withheld on such payments and any Additional Amounts) will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary
income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment
(including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of the Additional Notes), based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the
payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. Holder generally will not realize exchange gain or loss on
the interest payment but may realize exchange gain or loss when the holder disposes of any euros it receives. An accrual
basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest payment denominated in
euro in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the
average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable
years of the U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable year).

Under the second method, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis
of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable
years of the U.S. Holder, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within the taxable year).
Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an
electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect
on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning
of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder and will be irrevocable
without the consent of the IRS.

Upon an accrual basis U.S. Holder’s receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid
interest upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Additional Notes) denominated in euro, the
U.S. Holder may recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss and generally U.S. source) equal to


-----

the difference between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the
amount previously accrued, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

If the Additional Notes are issued at an “issue price” (excluding for such purpose any amount attributable to pre-issuance
accrued interest) which is less than the stated principal amount of the Additional Notes will be considered to have been
issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless the difference is less than a _de_
_minimis_ threshold (equal to 1/4 of 1% of the Additional Notes’ stated principal amount multiplied by the number of
complete years to maturity from their “issue date”). The “issue date” is the first date upon which a substantial amount of
the Additional Notes is sold for cash to persons other than bondhouses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting
in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers.

A U.S. Holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer) generally will be required to include OID with respect to the
notes in gross income (as ordinary income) as the OID accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis), before the receipt of
cash payments attributable to such OID. In general, the amount of OID includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder will
generally be equal to a ratable amount of OID with respect to the Additional Notes for each day in an accrual period during
the taxable year or portion of the taxable year on which a U.S. Holder held the Additional Notes. An accrual period may
be of any length and the accrual periods may vary in length over the term of the Additional Notes, provided that each
accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the final day
of an accrual period or on the first day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period is an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the product of the Additional Notes’ adjusted issue price at the beginning of such accrual
period and its yield to maturity, determined on the basis of a compounding assumption that reflects the length of the accrual
period over (ii) the sum of the stated interest payments on the notes allocable to the accrual period. The adjusted issue price
of the Additional Notes at the beginning of any accrual period generally equals the issue price of the Additional Notes
increased by the amount of all previously accrued OID.

A U.S. Holder of Notes treated as issued with OID must (i) determine OID allocable to each accrual period in euros using
the constant yield method described above, and (ii) translate the amount of OID into U.S. dollars and recognize foreign
currency gain or loss in the same manner as described above for stated interest accrued by an accrual basis U.S. Holder
when the OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable
to OID previously included in income). U.S. Holders should note that because the cash payment in respect of accrued OID
on the Additional Notes will not be made until maturity or other disposal of the Additional Notes, a greater possibility
exists for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (and the required recognition of exchange gain or loss) than is
the case for foreign currency instruments issued without OID. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding
the interplay between the application of the OID and foreign currency exchange gain or loss rules.

The rules regarding OID are complex and the rules described above may not apply in all cases. Accordingly, you should
consult your own tax advisors regarding their application.

**_Premium_**

If the Additional Notes are fungible with the Original Notes and the U.S. Holder purchases an Additional Note for an
amount in excess of its principal amount (less any amount attributable to pre-issuance accrued interest), such U.S. Holder
will be considered for U.S. federal income tax purposes to have purchased the Additional Note at a premium. Such U.S.
Holder generally may elect to amortize the premium amount (or an amount determined with reference to the amount
payable on an earlier call date if it results in a smaller premium) over the remaining term of the Additional Note (or until
an earlier call date, as applicable) on a constant yield method as an offset to the interest that such U.S. Holder otherwise
would include in gross income under its regular tax accounting method. Such election, once made generally applies to all
debt instruments held or subsequently acquired by the U.S. Holder on or after the first taxable year to which the election
applies. Such election may be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder that elects to amortize such premium
must reduce its tax basis in the Additional Note by the amount of the premium amortized during its holding period. If a
U.S. Holder does not elect to amortize the premium, the amount of such premium will be included in such U.S. Holder’s
tax basis when the Additional Note matures or is disposed of by such holder. Therefore, a U.S. Holder that does not elect


-----

to amortize such premium and that holds the Additional Note to maturity generally will be required to treat the premium
as capital loss when the Additional Note matures.

Amortizable bond premium will be computed in foreign currency. A U.S. Holder making the election to amortize bond
premium may recognize foreign currency gain or loss each accrual period equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar
value of bond premium with respect to such period determined on the date the interest attributable to such period is received
and the U.S. dollar value of such amortized bond premium determined on the date of the acquisition of the Additional
Notes.

The Additional Notes are subject to call provisions at various times. As a result, a U.S. Holder will calculate the amount
of amortizable bond premium based on the amount payable on an applicable call date if the use of the call price and the
call date results in a smaller amortizable bond premium for the period ending on the call date. The foregoing rule may
eliminate, reduce or defer any amortization deductions.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

A U.S. Holder may be entitled to deduct or credit foreign taxes, if any, imposed on interest (including Additional Amounts)
and accrued OID (if applicable), subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit taxes applies
to all of such U.S. Holder’s other applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest income on a Note generally
will constitute foreign source income and be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit
allowable to U.S. Holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application
of complex rules that depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances and there are significant limitations on a U.S.
Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of
foreign tax credits.

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Additional Notes_**

Generally, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will
recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition (less any amount
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest not previously included in income, which will be taxable as such) and such U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Additional Note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in an Additional Note generally will
be its U.S. dollar cost (as defined below), excluding any amount attributable to pre-issuance accrued interest and reduced
by (i) the amount of any principal paid on the Additional Note, if any, and (ii) any amortizable bond premium previously
amortized by such U.S. Holder with respect to the Additional Note and increased by the amount of previously accrued
OID, if any. The U.S. dollar cost of a Note purchased with euros will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros paid for the
Additional Note determined at the spot rate on the relevant issue date. The amount realized on a sale, exchange, retirement
or other taxable disposition for an amount in euro will be the U.S. dollar value of this amount based on the spot rate on the
date of the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual method taxpayer,
the settlement date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, if the Additional Notes are traded on an
established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes). The election referred to in this paragraph must be
applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An
accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not make such election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are
exchange rate fluctuations between the date of the sale and the settlement date.

Except as described in the next paragraph, gain or loss on a disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source capital gain
or loss. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Additional Note for
more than one year at the time of disposition. A non-corporate U.S. Holder generally will be eligible for reduced rates of
taxation on any long-term capital gain recognized. Deductions for capital losses are subject to limitations.

A portion of a U.S. Holder’s gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated as exchange gain
or loss. Such exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source income or
loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Additional Note generally is the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the
Additional Note (decreased by any amortizable bond premium amortized by the U.S. Holder with respect to the Additional
Note and excluding the amount of any pre issuance accrued interest) calculated in euro on the date of purchase, and the


-----

amount of exchange gain or loss is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of such principal amount
determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Additional Note
(or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date of such purchase and taxable
disposition, if the Additional Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of such principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder
purchased the Additional Note. Any such exchange rate gain or loss (including any exchange gain or loss with respect to
the receipt of accrued but unpaid interest or accrued OID, if any) will be realized only to the extent of total gain or loss
realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

Under Treasury regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances,
the receipt of interest on a note, or a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or
foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note to the extent that any such receipt, sale, exchange, retirement
or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. U.S. Holders should consult their tax
advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Additional Notes, including
any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Certain Information Reporting Requirements with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals are required to file IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial
Assets as defined in section 6038D of the Code) to report information relating to an interest in the Additional Notes, subject
to certain exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions). Under
certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of the foregoing rules. U.S. Holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of these requirements on their ownership and disposition of the
Additional Notes. Penalties may apply for failure to properly complete and file IRS Form 8938.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally should not be subject to U.S. federal
income or withholding tax on any payments on the Additional Notes and gain from the sale, redemption or other disposition
of the Additional Notes unless: (i) that payment and/or gain is effectively connected with the conduct by that Non-U.S.
Holder of a trade or business in the U.S.; (ii) in the case of any gain realized on the sale or exchange of a Note by an
individual Non-U.S. Holder, that Holder is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the sale, exchange
or retirement and certain other conditions are met; or (iii) the Non-U.S. Holder is subject to tax pursuant to provisions of
the Code applicable to certain expatriates.

**_Backup Withholding and Related Information Reporting Requirements_**

In general, payments of interest (including the accrual of OID, if any) and the proceeds from sales or other dispositions
(including retirements or redemptions) of Notes held by a U.S. Holder may be required to be reported to the IRS unless the
U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient and, when required, demonstrates this fact. In addition, a U.S. Holder that is not an
exempt recipient may be subject to backup withholding unless it provides a taxpayer identification number and otherwise
complies with applicable certification requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a U.S.
Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the appropriate
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

In general, payments of principal and interest in respect of, and the proceeds from sales of, the Additional Notes, payable
to a Non-U.S. Holder by a U.S. paying agent or other U.S. intermediary will not be subject to backup withholding tax and
information reporting requirements if appropriate certification (IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other appropriate form) is
provided by the Non-U.S. Holder to the payor and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the certificate is false.


-----

**Certain Other Tax Considerations; Payments by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on the Additional Notes it is possible that such payments may be
subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any
applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. Holders may be eligible to receive a gross
up from the payor with respect to the amounts withheld, subject to certain exceptions, as described in “Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes”. Holders of Notes should consult with their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a_
Guarantor makes any payments with respect to the Additional Notes.


-----

**Certain ERISA Considerations**

Unless otherwise provided in any supplement to this offering memorandum, the Issued Notes should be eligible for
purchase by employee benefit plans and other plans subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code and by governmental, church and non-
U.S. plans that are subject to any federal, state, local or non-U.S. law or regulation that is substantially similar to the
provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Law”) subject to consideration of the
issues described in this section. ERISA imposes certain requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) that are subject to ERISA, on entities such as collective investment funds and separate accounts
whose underlying assets include the assets of such plans (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are
fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA's general fiduciary
requirements, including the requirements of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA
Plan's investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan. The prudence of a particular
investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan's
particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment including, but not limited to, the matters
discussed under “Risk Factors”.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan
(as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual
retirement accounts (together with ERISA Plans, the “Plans”)) and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” or
**“disqualified persons”) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is**
applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person, including a Plan fiduciary, who engages in a non-
exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

The Issuer, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any other party to the transactions referred
to in this offering memorandum may be parties in interest or disqualified persons with respect to many Plans. Prohibited
transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if any of the Issued Notes
is acquired or held by a Plan, including but not limited to where the Issuer, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent, the Registrar or any other party to such transactions is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Certain exemptions
from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable,
however, depending in part on the type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire any Issued Notes and the
circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to transactions between a person that is a party in interest (other than a fiduciary
or an affiliate that has or exercises discretionary authority or control or renders investment advice with respect to assets
involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the plan, provided that there is adequate consideration
for the transaction), Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective
investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by a qualified professional asset manager), PTCE 95-60
(relating to transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance
company pooled separate accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions determined by in-house asset managers).
Prospective investors should consult with their advisors regarding the prohibited transaction rules and these exemptions.
There can be no assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any
particular transaction involving any Issued Notes.

Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA)
and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions
of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless
be subject to Similar Law. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Issued
Notes to determine the need for, if necessary, and the availability of, any exemptive relief under any Similar Law.

In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor has promulgated a regulation, 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by
Section 3(42) of ERISA (the “Plan Asset Regulation”), describing what constitutes the assets of a Plan with respect to the
Plan's investment in an entity for purposes of certain provisions of ERISA, including the fiduciary responsibility provisions
of Title I of ERISA, Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. Under the Plan Asset Regulation, if a Plan
invests in an equity interest of an entity that is neither a publicly-offered security nor a security issued by an investment


-----

company registered under the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan's assets include both the equity
interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity's underlying assets, unless one of the exceptions to such treatment
described in the Plan Asset Regulation applies. Under the Plan Asset Regulation, a security which is in the form of debt
may be considered an equity interest if it has substantial equity features. If an Issuer was deemed under the Plan Asset
Regulation to hold plan assets by reason of a Plan's investment in any of the Issued Notes, such plan assets would include
an undivided interest in the assets held by the Issuer and transactions by the Issuer would be subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section
4975 of the Code. The Plan Asset Regulation provides, however, that if equity participation in any entity by “Benefit Plan
Investors” is not significant, then the “look-through” rule will not apply to such entity. The term “Benefit Plan Investors”
is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation to include (1) any “employee benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA
that is subject to Title I of ERISA, (2) any “plan” as described in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code, and (3) any
entity whose underlying assets include the assets of any such employee benefit plan subject to ERISA or other plan subject
to Section 4975 of the Code. Equity participation by Benefit Plan Investors in any entity is significant if, immediately after
the most recent acquisition of any equity interest in the entity, 25% or more of the total value of any class of equity interests
in the entity (excluding the value of any interests held by certain persons, other than Benefit Plan Investors, having or
exercising control over the assets of the entity or providing investment advice to the entity for a fee (direct or indirect) or
any “affiliates” (as defined in the Plan Asset Regulation) of such persons) is held by Benefit Plan Investors. If, as a result
of any investment, 25% or more of the total value of any class of equity interests in the Issuer is being held by Benefit Plan
Investors, the applicable Issued Notes may be redeemed by the Issuer. While there is little pertinent authority in this area
and no assurance can be given, the Issuer believes that the Issued Notes should not be treated as equity interests for the
purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation and, therefore, the Plan Asset Regulation should not apply and any such redemptions
would not be necessary.

Accordingly, except as otherwise provided in any supplement to this offering memorandum, each purchaser and subsequent
transferee of any Issued Notes will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree, on each day from the date on which the
purchaser or transferee acquires such Issued Notes (or any interest therein) through and including the date on which the
purchaser or transferee disposes of such Issued Notes (or any interest therein), either that (a) it is not, and is not acting on
behalf of (and for so long as it holds such Issued Notes or any interests therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf
of), a Benefit Plan Investor or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan which is subject to any Similar Law or (b) its
acquisition, holding and disposition of such Issued Notes (or any interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-
exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or, in the case of a governmental,
church or non-U.S. plan subject to Similar Law, a violation of any Similar Law.

Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of any Issued Notes that is a Benefit Plan Investor will be further deemed to
represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Issuer, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar
or any other party to the transactions referred to in this offering memorandum, or other persons that provide marketing
services, or any of their respective affiliates, has provided, and none of them will provide, any investment recommendation
or investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Benefit Plan Investor (“Plan
**Fiduciary”), has relied as a primary basis in connection with its decision to invest in the Issued Notes, and they are not**
otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the
Benefit Plan Investor or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the Benefit Plan Investor’s acquisition of the Issued Notes;
and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Issued Notes.

Each Plan Fiduciary who is responsible for making the investment decisions whether to purchase or commit to purchase
and to hold any of the Issued Notes should determine whether, under the documents and instruments governing the Plan,
an investment in such Issued Notes is appropriate for the Plan, taking into account the overall investment policy of the Plan
and the composition of the Plan's investment portfolio. Any Plan proposing to invest in such Issued Notes (including any
governmental, church or non-U.S. plan) should consult with its counsel to confirm that such investment will not constitute
or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction and will satisfy the other requirements of ERISA and the Code (or, in the
case of a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, any Similar Law).

The sale of any Issued Notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by the Issuer, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any other party to the transactions that such an investment meets all relevant legal


-----

requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate
for Plans generally or any particular Plan.

**Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law**

**Considerations**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests in each_
_of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantees or Collateral are being provided. It is a summary only, and proceedings of_
_bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of_
_organization of a future Guarantor of the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could_
_trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply, and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights_
_and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests on the Collateral._

_Also set out below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in certain EU jurisdiction’s including France_
_and Belgium. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer or the Guarantors, it is not possible to predict with certainty_
_in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such_
_proceedings._

**European Union**

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency
proceedings, recast as amended, in particular by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of July 4, 2018 (the “Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), the courts
of the Member State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the Insolvency
Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor.

The center of main interest is defined as the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular
basis and which is ascertainable by third parties. In the case of a debtor or legal person, the place of the registered office
shall be presumed to be the center of its main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only
apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request
for commencement of insolvency proceedings (as defined in Article (4) of the Insolvency Regulation).

The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different
Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

A debtor’s center of main interests is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the
purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the
filing of the insolvency petition. In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the
debtor conducts the majority of its business and the perception of the debtor’s creditors as regards to the local center of the
debtor’s business operations may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the debtor has its “center of main
interests”. Accordingly, and as the presumption that the registered office is the center of main interests is rebuttable, the
relevant court of a Member State must carefully assess whether the center of the debtor’s main interests is genuinely located
in that Member State. It may be possible to rebut this presumption where the debtor’s central administration is located in a
Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors
establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and supervision
and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State.

If the center of main interests of a debtor is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it
has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the Insolvency Regulation would
be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types
of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in
one Member State under the Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than
Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State.

If the center of main interests of a debtor is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary territorial
insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined


-----

in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined
to mean any place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request
to commence main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.

When main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its center of main interests,
any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be
secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor
situated in the territory of such other Member State.

When main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its center of main interests have not yet been
commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an
establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s
center of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are
commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment
situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (ii) a public
authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right
to request the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will,
subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the _lex fori concursus, i.e._ the local insolvency law of the court that has
assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, the courts of the Member State within
the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly
from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

The commencement of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the Insolvency Regulation shall not affect
the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both
specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that
are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include:

      - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income
from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

      - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by
assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

      - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary
to the wishes of the party so entitled;

      - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main
proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have
been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to
commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s center of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on
it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member
State) subject to certain limitations (in particular, subject to the preservation of third parties’ rights _in rem pursuant to_
Article 8 of the Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title pursuant
to Article 10 of the Insolvency Regulation), as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other
Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency
proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets.

However, under to Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a
unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings


-----

could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply
with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency
proceedings were commenced in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to
approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other
Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary
insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to
open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement
proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a debtor and its creditors, the court, at the request
of the debtor or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary
insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the
interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay
the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors
in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the
process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings
to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of
individual classes of creditors.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of the Guarantors’ subsidiaries experience financial
difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings
would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of
the obligations and the security of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

**_EU Directive on Preventive Restructuring Frameworks_**

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive restructuring
frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures
concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on
restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was published on June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in
financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue
operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt
after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures
concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length.

The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency,
discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring
procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that
encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that
insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the EU Restructuring Directive
provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must
be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of
which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in
separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not
more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number
of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under
certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to
the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or
administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with


-----

the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The framework of the Restructuring Directive also provides for the
protection of new financing and interim financing and that new or interim financing granted in the context of a restructuring
may also be granted a priority ranking.

**France**

We conduct part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the registered office or the main center of interest
within the meaning of Article R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code of any member of the Group (such as French
Guarantors) is in France, it would be subject to French court-assisted proceedings affecting creditors (i.e. mandat ad hoc
or conciliation proceedings which do not fall within the scope of the Insolvency Regulation). In addition, any company of
our Group having its center of main interests or an establishment, both within the meaning of Insolvency Regulation or, if
not applicable, its registered office or its main center of interests within the meaning of Article R. 600-1 of the French
Commercial Code in France, could also be subject to French court-administered proceedings being either safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) or accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée),
judicial reorganization proceedings (procédure de redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (procedure
_de liquidation judiciaire)._

Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization and judicial
liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our
Group having its COMI in France could be subject to French main insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the
Insolvency Regulation and any company of our Group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU
Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings within the meaning of
the EU Insolvency Regulation. Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation also lists accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
as insolvency proceedings but accelerated financial safeguard proceedings no longer have a separate existence under
French law as they have been merged into accelerated safeguard proceedings as of October 1[st], 2021 (save for proceedings
commenced before this date) by the 2021 Ordinance.

Specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or insolvency proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or exceed (on a
stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (x) 20 million euros in net turnover and 250 employees
or (y) 40 million euros in net turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings with respect to which the court’s international
jurisdiction results from the application of the Insolvency Regulation or (iii) in cases where the Insolvency Regulation does
not apply, from the debtor having its main center of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts.

In addition, the French court that commences preventive or insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a
corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having international
jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above and to specific control thresholds);
accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the
same administrator (administrateur judiciaire) and creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings in
respect of members of the group.

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the
payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and/or the Guarantees granted by
the French Guarantors and corresponding security interests.

French insolvency legislation has been amended by ordinance no. 2021-1193 dated 15 September 2021, completed by
decree no. 2021-1218 dated 23 September 2021 (together, the “2021 Ordinance”). The 2021 Ordinance, which inter alia
transposed the EU Restructuring Directive into French law, entered into force on 1 October 2021 and, subject to very
limited exceptions, is applicable to insolvency proceedings opened as from that date. The following is a general discussion
of insolvency proceedings governed by French law for informational purposes only and does not address all the French
legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Notes. The descriptions of French insolvency legislation
contained in this section are based on literal interpretations of the 2021 Ordinance, which could differ from the
interpretation which will be given to the terms of the 2021 Ordinance by scholars, insolvency practitioners and case law.

**_Warning Procedure (procédure d’alerte)_**

In order to anticipate a debtor’s difficulties to the extent possible, French law provides for warning procedures. When there
are elements which they believe put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy, the statutory auditors of a
company must request the management to provide an explanation. Failing satisfactory explanation or appropriate corrective
measures, the statutory auditors must request that a board of directors (or the equivalent body), and as the case may be at
a later stage the shareholders’ meeting be convened and may request to be heard by the president of the relevant commercial
court. Depending on the answers provided to them (and the type of company), the statutory auditors must inform the
President of the relevant commercial or civil court of the warning procedure.

Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the social and economic committee (or in their absence the
employees’ representatives) have similar rights.

The President of the relevant commercial or civil court can also himself summon the management to provide explanations
on elements which the President of the relevant commercial or civil court believes put the company’s existence as a going
concern in jeopardy (or when the company has not filed its annual financial statements within the statutory timeframe,
despite his/her injunction).

Under the warning procedure (procédure d’alerte) provided for in Articles L. 234-1, L. 234-2; L. 251-15 and L. 612-3 of
the French Commercial Code, the statutory auditors have the option, after having informed the legal representative of the
company of events likely to compromise the going concern, of notifying the president of the competent court of the
inadequacy or lack of measures taken by the legal representative. The purpose of this measure is to provide the president
of the court as early as possible and as promptly as possible, with information relating to the difficulties encountered by a
company.

The provisions set out in the above paragraph are also applicable to warning procedures initiated before October 1st, 2021,
pursuant to Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the public
health state of emergency that was imposed by the French government. In addition, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20,
2020 provides that, when communicating with the president of the court under the circumstances set out above, the statutory
auditor is released from his or her obligation of professional secrecy towards the president of the relevant commercial
court. Warning procedures as resulting from Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 are applicable until December
31, 2021.

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition to the specific provisions of insolvency law discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code.

Pursuant to the provisions of this Article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings involving the debtor,
whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s needs,
defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment dates of payment obligations that are due
and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is
lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as published semi-annually by decree by the French
government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. At the request of the debtor, a court
order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any
contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the
relevant judge. A creditor cannot contract out of such grace periods. If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or
has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods
(see “—Conciliation Proceedings” below).

**_Out-of-court and in-court proceedings_**

French law distinguishes between:


-----

(i) court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc and conciliation), which are voluntary proceedings in which the debtor
seeks the help of a third party to negotiate an agreement with all or part of its creditors and stakeholders that puts
an end to its difficulties with a view to, in particular, restructuring its indebtedness. These proceedings are
confidential. The third party is appointed by the President of the competent court upon proposal of the debtor
company but the discussions themselves are conducted outside the court; and

(ii) court-administered proceedings (procédures collectives), which are proceedings, during which payments by the
debtor and legal actions by the creditors are suspended (automatic stay). These proceedings are public and involve
all creditors (except, under certain circumstances, for accelerated safeguard proceedings). Within this second
category, French law further distinguishes between:

      - safeguard proceedings and accelerated safeguard proceedings, which are voluntary proceedings and available to
a debtor that is facing difficulties it cannot overcome but that is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test” below) (or
for accelerated safeguard proceedings, that is not insolvent for less than 45 days when it initially requested the
opening of conciliation proceedings); and

      - judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, which are mandatory proceedings and must be
commenced by a debtor that is insolvent (unless such debtor applies for conciliation proceedings within 45
calendar days of having become insolvent).

**_Insolvency Test_**

Under French law, a company is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is unable to pay
its debts as they fall due with its immediately available assets taking into account available credit lines, existing debt
rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

If judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings are commenced, the date of insolvency (état de cessation des
_paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court order commencing the insolvency proceedings, unless the court_
sets an earlier date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court order. Except for fraud, the
date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement
(homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening
period (période suspecte) (see below).

**_Court-Assisted Proceedings_**

A French company facing difficulties without being insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) (or for 45 calendar days
or less in the case of conciliation proceedings) may request the opening of court-assisted insolvency proceedings (mandat
_ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to help the company reach an agreement with its main creditors and stakeholders_
e.g. an agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness. Mandat ad hoc and conciliation are informal proceedings which
can only be initiated by the debtor (in its sole discretion) and are carried out under the supervision of the president of the
relevant court.

_Mandat ad hoc_

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties (economic or financial) but are not_
insolvent. They are informal, confidential and are not limited in time. They are carried out under the aegis of a court-
appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc, whose name can be suggested by the debtor) itself under the supervision of the
president of the court and do not automatically involve any stay of the claims or pending proceedings The duties of the
_mandataire ad hoc_ are determined by the competent court that appoints him or her. _Mandataires ad hoc_ are usually
appointed to facilitate negotiations with creditors. The restructuring agreement reached between the debtor and its main
creditors (if any) will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis; those creditors not willing to take part
cannot be bound by the arrangement. Creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their
claims but, in practice, those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for a certain
period of time, to try to negotiate a consensual solution with the company. In any event, the debtor retains the right to


-----

petition the relevant judge for grace periods under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code, as set forth above. The
agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it. The ordinance of the president
of the court appointing the Mandataire ad hoc shall be notified for informational purposes to the debtor’s statutory auditors.

_Conciliation proceedings_

Conciliation proceedings are available to a debtor that faces current or foreseeable difficulties of a legal, economic or
financial nature and which (at the time the conciliation proceedings are commenced) has not been insolvent for more than
45 calendar days. The debtor petitions the president of the relevant court for the appointment of a conciliator (whose name
it can suggest) in charge of assisting the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or other
stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, providing e.g. for the restructuring of its indebtedness.

_Conciliation proceedings are confidential (save for their disclosure to statutory auditors if any and subject to the below)_
and may last up to four months (with the conciliator being able to request an extension up to five months). In case the
debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué) or acknowledged (constaté), its request must be
filed by the end of this five-month period, even though the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation
period will be extended until the decision of the president of the court or the court itself.

Whilst no general stay is imposed on creditors, which may therefore continue to sue the debtor for payment of their claims
(although creditors usually in practice restrain from taking any such enforcement action in order to negotiate a consensual
restructuring), the following measures may affect creditors’ rights during conciliation proceedings:

(i) if the debtor receives a formal notice from a creditor requesting payment or faces enforcement measures, or if a

creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to defer payment of its
claim, the debtor may petition the judge that commenced conciliation proceedings to grant, after having heard the
conciliator, grace periods in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods” above);

(ii) if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to defer

payment of its claim, the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings may, after having heard the conciliator, defer
or reschedule that creditor’s claims that are not yet due for the duration of the conciliation proceedings; and

(iii) creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation

_judiciaire) against the debtor._

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be either:

(i) upon all parties’ request, acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the court, which makes it immediately
enforceable with the legal force of a final judgment, which means that it constitutes a judicial title that can be
enforced by the parties without further recourse to a judge (titre exécutoire). This acknowledgement decision is
not made public; or

(ii) upon the debtor’s request, approved (homologué) by the commercial court if (A) the debtor is not insolvent or if
the rescheduling agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (B) the agreement
effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (C) the agreement does not impair the
rights of the non-signatory creditors.

All the terms of the agreement are not made public but the existence of the court decision approving the agreement is made
public and such court decision discloses the guarantees or security interests granted to the parties and the claims that benefit
from the New Money Lien, if any (see below).

In case of acknowledgement (constat) or approval (homologation), the court can, at the request of the debtor, appoint the
conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution.


-----

The approval (homologation) by the court, upon the debtor’s request will have the same effect as its acknowledgement
(constatation) and will make the existence of the conciliation proceedings public and have the following specific
consequences:

        - creditors who provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the
debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of
payment over all pre-proceedings and post-proceedings claims (except with respect to certain pre-commencement,
employment claims and post-commencement procedural costs) (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of
subsequent court-administered proceedings;

        - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of the
debtor’s insolvency (cessation des paiements), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (see — “The
_Hardening Period (période suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings”) cannot be set by_
the court at a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the court except in
case of fraud;

        - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its statutory
auditors; and

        - in the event of subsequent court-administered proceedings, the payment date of claims benefiting from the New
Money Lien may not be rescheduled to a date later than the date on which the safeguard or reorganization plan is
adopted and these claims may not be written-off without their holders’ consent.

So long as the conciliation agreement is in effect:

        - any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to the claims included in the agreement are suspended and/or
prohibited;

        - interest accruing on the affected claims can no longer be compounded;

        - the debtor retains the right to petition the president of the court that opened conciliation proceedings for grace
periods pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods” above) in relation to claims
of creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security
administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were
not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, in which case the decision of the court would be taken after having
heard the conciliator in the event that he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the conciliation
agreement.

Any joint-debtor or third party having granted a guarantee (sûreté personnelle) or a security interest (sûreté réelle) with
respect to the debtor’s obligations can benefit from the grace periods granted to the debtor in the context of conciliation
proceedings pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code or during the implementation period of the
conciliation agreement pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code as well as from the provisions of
the approved or acknowledged conciliation agreement.

In the event of a breach of the conciliation agreement, any party to it can petition the president of the court or the court
(depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its rescission. If such rescission is granted, grace
periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Such termination will not apply to the clauses
of the conciliation agreement organizing the consequences of such rescission and such clauses shall continue to apply.

The commencement of subsequent court-administered proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation
agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments already received) and pre-
existing security interests or guarantees.


-----

Conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft restructuring plan has been negotiated and is supported by a large
majority of creditors which is likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard without reaching
unanimity, will be a mandatory preliminary step of the accelerated safeguard proceedings (see “—Court-Administered
Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard” below).

At the request of the debtor and after the participating creditors have been consulted on the matter, the mandataire ad hoc
or the conciliator may be appointed with a mission to organize the sale of all or part of the business of the debtor which
would be implemented, as applicable, in the context of subsequent insolvency proceedings; any offers received in this
context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliator may be directly submitted to the court in the context of insolvency
proceedings after consultation of the public prosecutor.

Any contractual provision that modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’
rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of
conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end, and any contractual provision requiring the debtor to bear,
by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, for the
portion that would exceed three-quarters of the total fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection
with these proceedings, are deemed null and void.

Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being reached, the
proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any specific legal consequences
for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation
proceedings cannot be commenced before three months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones.

Some specific temporary measures adopted in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic and the state of health emergency
(see “—Covid-19 Temporary Framework” below) have modified conciliation proceedings. As a result, until 31 December
2021:

        - the duration of conciliation proceedings can be extended upon request of the conciliator, thereby increasing the
maximum duration of conciliation proceedings to 10 months (instead of 5 months);

        - if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to defer
payment of its claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the debtor may request from the President
of the court in ex-parte proceedings, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings: (x) the stay or prohibition of
any legal action for payment or for termination of a contract for a payment default; or (y) the stay or prohibition
of any judicial enforcement measure against the debtor’s movable or immovable property as well as any judicial
procedure relating to the distribution of the debtor’s assets that would not have already transferred ownership
away from the debtor; or (z) the deferral or rescheduling of the creditor’s claim; and

        - The debtor may petition the judge that commenced conciliation proceedings for a grace period in accordance with
Article 1345-5 of the French Civil Code (see “Grace Periods” above) even before the creditor sends any formal
notice requesting payment or initiates any suit for payment, if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by
the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of its claim.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings_**

The following French proceedings may be initiated by or against a company in France:

        - safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) or accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de
_sauvegarde accélérée), upon petition by the debtor only if, while not being insolvent (or for accelerated safeguard_
proceedings, if insolvent for less than 45 days when it initially requested the opening of the prerequisite
conciliation proceedings), it is facing difficulties which it cannot overcome. Absent any difficulties it cannot
overcome, the court will invite the debtor to file for conciliation proceedings.


-----

        - judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation
_judiciaire) upon petition by the debtor, any creditor or the public prosecutor if the debtor is insolvent. Judicial_
reorganization proceedings are available to companies whose recovery prospects are possible while judicial
liquidation proceedings are available to companies whose recovery is manifestly impossible.

While a company may file for safeguard proceedings at any time it is facing insurmountable difficulties, it is required to
petition for the commencement of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings within 45 days of becoming
insolvent. Alternatively, the debtor may request the opening of conciliation proceedings within the same timeframe. If it
does not, de jure managers and, as the case may be, de facto managers of the company, may be subject to civil liability.

A lien (the Post-Money Lien) applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made through a
share capital increase, by any person (i) during the observation period in safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings
or the temporary continuation of business operations in judicial liquidation proceedings, in order to ensure the continuity
of debtor’s business during such proceedings, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the supervisory
judge, or (ii) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, including when such plan is being amended,
it being specified that the judgment endorsing or modifying the plan must mention all claims benefiting from the Post-
Money Lien, as well as the relevant amounts.

Claims benefiting from the Post-Money Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and post-
commencement claims in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings
or judicial liquidation proceedings, except notably with respect to employees’ super-privilege claims, post-proceeding
procedural costs, the New Money Lien, pre-petition claims secured by real estate security (in judicial liquidation
proceedings only) and post-petition wages claims not advanced by the French wages guarantee fund. Claims benefitting
from the Post-Money Lien cannot be the subject of any rescheduling or waiver without the consent of their holders.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Safeguard_**

A debtor which experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test”
_above).. Creditors of the debtor do not attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard_
proceedings is requested.

Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is
appointed (except for small companies if the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) to investigate the
business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period from the date of the court decision commencing
the proceedings to the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to
12 months, and to help the debtor in elaborating a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circulate
to its creditors. Creditors or equity holders do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands
of the debtor, assisted by the court-appointed administrator who will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment, exercise
supervising control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of
the management decisions (mission d’assistance) and to prepare a safeguard plan for the company, all under the supervision
of the court.

A supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) and a creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) are also appointed at the
beginning of the proceedings, alongside the court-appointed administrator. Management decisions in respect of disposals
(acte de disposition) that fall outside the scope of the ordinary course of business, as well as decisions considered to be
important under statute, require the prior approval of the supervisory judge (e.g., granting security interests or settling
disputes).

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements)
before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or
the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into
judicial reorganization proceedings.


-----

In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (a) judicial reorganization proceedings (i) at any time during
the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (ii) if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if
the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (b) judicial liquidation proceedings at
any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases:

      - the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative
or the public prosecutor or upon its own initiative except in the case of (a)(ii) above where: (x) the court may not
act upon its own initiative, and (y) the court would decide such conversion at the request of the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor in the event that no plan has been adopted by
the relevant classes of Affected Parties (as defined below) or at the sole request of the debtor in all other
circumstances;

      - the court's decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors'
representative, the controllers (contrôleurs), the public prosecutor and the workers' representatives (if any).

In case of conversion of the proceedings, classes of Affected Parties that would already be constituted before the conversion
would remain with the same allocation and computation of the votes, subject to pending challenges. The process of
constitution of classes shall continue notwithstanding this conversion.

As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately
due and payable.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the
proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the
observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very
limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for prior debts to discharge a lien on property needed
for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary
estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). Debts duly arising after the commencement of the safeguard proceedings and which are
incurred for the requirements of the proceedings, or in consideration for services rendered or goods delivered to the debtor
during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the
commencement of the safeguard proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as the New Money Lien).

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the plan (debt remissions,
payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court.

The rules governing consultation vary according to the size of the business.

Liabilities to be taken into account in the draft plan shall include, provided that they are established on the basis of a
certificate drawn up by a certified public accountant or the statutory auditor, those claims admitted and not challenged as
well as those “identifiable” claims (in particular when the deadline for filing proofs of claim has not expired yet).

_Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors that, on the date of the petition for commencement of the_
proceedings (on a stand-alone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles
L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) have less than (x) 250 employees and € 20 million in net turnover
or (y) € 40 million in net turnover unless, upon their request, the supervisory judge authorizes a class-based consultation
of their creditors (see below). In case of standard consultation, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement
of debts to the court-appointed creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim,
regarding the proposed debt settlement provided under the draft plan (including debt remissions, payment terms or debt-
for-equity-swaps). Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the proposals for settlement can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle
of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established
practice, in the absence of a specific legislative prohibition, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided
that it is justified by the specific position of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In


-----

practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of the claim over a shorter
time period instead of a full payment of the claim over ten years or 15 years in relation to agricultural or maritime fishing
businesses.

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase
by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the
provisions of the plan).

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved
do not need to be consulted.

Creditors consulted in writing which do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other
than debt-for-equity-swap proposals which require the agreement of each individual creditor in writing) are deemed to
have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor,
the administrator and the controllers. Pursuant to the Covid-19 Temporary Framework, until 31 December 2021 the
abovementioned 30-day deadline may be reduced to 15 days by the supervisory judge, at the request of the court-appointed
administrator or the court-appointed creditors’ representative.

If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders
general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital
of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the
shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights.
The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, if the creditors refuse the proposals that were submitted to them, the court
that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose on them a uniform rescheduling of their claims (subject
to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the Post-Money Lien – see above) over a maximum
period of 10 years (except for agriculture businesses where the maximum is 15 years and for claims with maturity dates of
more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of
any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

Following a court-imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan
or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for
by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had it been
paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. In the third, fourth and fifth
year, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim, and at least 10% of
the amount of each debt claim as from the sixth year, except for agricultural businesses.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the
continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

_Classes of Affected Parties-based consultation: this applies mandatorily to (i) companies that either (x) employ at least 250_
employees and have a net turnover of at least €20 million or (y) have a net turnover of at least €40 million, and (ii)
companies that own or control another company, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French
Commercial Code, provided that all the companies together reach the aforementioned thresholds. This consultation also
applies, in case these thresholds are not met, upon the debtor’s request and with the consent of the supervisory judge (juge
_commissaire)._

The consultation involves the submission of a draft safeguard plan prepared by the debtor with the assistance of the court-
appointed administrator for consideration by affected parties (parties affectées) (the “Affected Parties”) which include:

        - creditors whose rights are directly affected by the draft safeguard plan;


-----

        - all types of equity holders (whether they own common or preferred stock or securities giving future access to the
share capital of the debtor) (the “Equity Holders”) provided that their equity interest in the debtor, the debtor’s
articles of association or their rights are modified by the draft safeguard plan.

Only the Affected Parties are entitled to vote on the draft plan.

The classes of Affected Parties are established by the court-appointed administrator who will, on the basis of objective and
verifiable criteria, group within the same class Affected Parties sharing a sufficient commonality of economic interest
(communauté d’intérêt économique suffisante). The claims and rights that are taken into account are those that arose prior
to the judgment commencing the proceedings (it being noted that claims resulting from a labor contract, pension rights
pursuant to a professional retirement scheme and essential needs claims (créances alimentaires) are not affected by the
plan). Claims taken into account are those indicated by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor(s) or, in the absence
of a statutory auditor, in a list from the debtor's certified public accountant. Where Equity Holders are affected by the draft
plan, the list shall be supplemented by information relating to structure of participation in the debtor's share capital, the
articles of association and the rights of the Equity Holders.

Furthermore, class formation must respect the following conditions:

        - creditors of secured claims (i.e. claims benefitting from a security interest over the debtor’s assets) shall, in respect
of their guaranteed claims, be treated in a separate class than other creditors, with regards to their secured claims;

        - class formation must comply with subordination agreements entered into by the Affected Parties before the
commencement of the proceedings, provided that the Affected Parties have notified the existence of such
subordination agreements to the court-appointed administrator within 10 days of the receipt of the notice sent by
the court-appointed administrator or the publication of such notice inviting the Affected Parties to notify the
existence of such subordination agreements. Otherwise, the subordination agreements are unenforceable in the
context of the proceedings;

        - Equity Holders form one or more classes.

In respect of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor, only the amount of their claims that are
not secured by such security trust is taken into account.

The court-appointed administrator can also create “ad hoc” classes for example for public creditors or strategic suppliers.

It is unclear whether the beneficiary of a guarantee granted by the debtor company will be considered as an affected party
and, should this be the case, to which class of affected party it would belong. It cannot be excluded in particular that the
guarantee being called or not may have an impact on the assessment made by the court-appointed administrator.

At least 21 days prior to the date of the vote on the draft plan, the court-appointed administrator shall submit to each
Affected Party the methods for class allocation and for computation of the voting rights corresponding to the affected
claims or rights that enable them to cast a vote. The amount of the claims taken into account for the computation of the
voting rights is the one indicated by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or chartered
accountant (expert-comptable). The methods used are also notified to the court-appointed creditor’s representative. In the
event of disagreement, the matter may be brought before the supervisory judge at the request of the Affected Party, the
debtor, the public prosecutor, court-appointed creditor’s representative or the court-appointed administrator. The
supervisory judge must rule within ten days of the referral date, and failing that, any aforementioned person may refer the
dispute to the court, which must rule within ten days of such later referral date. The supervisory judge’s decision (or the
court’s decision, as the case may be) may be appealed within five days of its notification to the parties.

The right of an Affected Party to vote in a class is attached to its pre-petition claim and is assigned as a right alongside the
claim itself notwithstanding any clause to the contrary. The assignee of the claim will only be entitled to receive the debtor’s


-----

proposals and to vote once the transfer has been communicated to the court-appointed administrator by a registered letter
with acknowledgement of receipt. A creditor whose claim is extinguished or transferred is no longer deemed an Affected
Party.

The debtor, with the assistance of the court-appointed administrator, submits proposals to the classes of Affected Parties
in order to prepare a draft plan that is communicated to these classes to be then voted on. Where the thresholds applicable
to specialized commercial courts are not met (see above “–Insolvency–”), the debtor’s Equity Holders which are affected
by the draft plan can make a non-monetary contribution to the restructuring (e.g. by providing their experience, reputation
or professional contacts).

The draft plan does not have to be limited to a ten-year duration nor respect the annual instalments provided for in the
standard consultation above.

The classes of Affected Parties must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. This
timeframe may be increased or decreased following a request by the debtor or the court-appointed administrator to the
judge but cannot be less than 15 days.

The procedures for convening the affected parties and organizing their vote vary according to the parties concerned
(creditors, bondholders, equity holders) and are ultimately determined by the court-appointed judicial administrator subject
to certain guidelines set by the 2021 Ordinance.

The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each class, provided that the majority is two-thirds of the amounts of
claims of the creditors expressing a vote. The Equity Holders’ class shall approve the restructuring plan in accordance with
the provisions applicable to the relevant extraordinary general meetings / special meetings or mass meetings where relevant,
subject to the afore-mentioned voting timetable and majority. Within a class of Affected Parties, the vote on the draft plan
may be replaced by an agreement which, after consultation of the class’ members, has been approved by two-thirds of the
class votes.

Following the approval of the plan by all of the classes of the Affected Parties, the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the
court, which will make sure that the interests of all the Affected Parties are “sufficiently protected”. In considering such
approval, the court has to verify that:

        - the plan has been approved in accordance with the rules governing the constitution of classes of Affected Parties;

        - Affected Parties which share sufficient commonality of interests within a class, benefit from an equal treatment
and are treated in proportion to their claim or right;

        - the plan has been regularly notified to all Affected Parties;

        - if some Affected Parties have voted against the plan, none of these parties is in a worse situation, under the plan,
than they would be if the order of priority for the distribution of asset sale proceeds in judicial liquidation
proceedings, whether the assets are sold individually or the business as a going concern is sold via an asset sale
plan (plan de cession) pursuant to Article L. 642-1 of the French Commercial Code were to apply or in the event
of a better alternative solution if the restructuring plan were not to be approved (also referred to as the “best
interest test” criteria);

        - to the extent applicable, any new financing necessary to implement the plan does not unduly prejudice (ne porte
_pas une atteinte excessive aux) the interest of Affected Parties._

Even if these criteria are met, the court may refuse to approve the plan if it does not offer a reasonable prospect of (i)
preventing the insolvency of the debtor or (ii) ensuring the sustainability of the business (viabilité de l’entreprise).

Once so approved by the relevant court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all.


-----

If the plan is not approved by each and every class of Affected Parties at the two-thirds majority described above, the plan
may however be approved (arrêté) by the court at the request of (i) the debtor or (ii) the court-appointed administrator with
the consent of the debtor and imposed on dissenting classes by means of a “cross-class cram-down” (application forcée
_interclasses), provided that the plan meets the following conditions:_

        - the draft plan respects the conditions set out above relating to the approval of the plan by all of the classes of
Affected Parties;

        - the plan has been approved:

`o` by a majority of the voting classes of Affected Parties, provided that at least one of those classes is a
secured creditors class or is senior to the ordinary unsecured creditors class (créanciers chirographaires);
or, failing that,

`o` by at least one of the voting classes of Affected Parties, other than an Equity Holders class or any other
class for which it is reasonable to assume that, upon a valuation of the debtor as a going-concern, it would
not be entitled to receive any payment or keep any interest if the normal ranking of priorities for the
distribution of asset sale proceeds in judicial liquidation proceedings, whether the assets are sold
individually or the business as a going concern is sold via an asset sale plan (plan de cession), were
applied;

        - a dissenting voting class of Affected Parties must be satisfied in full before a more junior class may receive any
distribution or keep any interest under the restructuring plan (also referred to as the “absolute priority” rule);

        - no class of Affected Parties, can, under the plan, receive or keep more than the full amount of its claims or interests;

        - if one or more classes of Equity Holders have been constituted and have not approved the plan, this plan can be
imposed on them provided that:

`o` the debtor (x) either employs at least 250 employees and has a net turnover of €20 million (y) or has a
net turnover of €40 million (such thresholds applying to companies that own or control another company,
within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, provided that all
the companies together reach the aforementioned thresholds);

`o` it is reasonable to assume that, based on the value of the debtor as a going-concern, Equity Holders of
the dissenting classes would not receive any payment or retain any interest if the normal ranking of
priorities for the distribution of asset sale proceeds in judicial liquidation proceedings, whether piecemeal
or via an asset sale plan, were applied;

`o` if the plan provides for a share capital increase through a cash contribution, the newly issued shares shall
be offered in priority to the shareholders (in proportion to their shareholding); and

`o` the plan does not provide for the transfer of all or part of the rights of the class or classes of dissenting
Equity Holders.

The court, at the request of (i) the debtor or (ii) the court-appointed administrator with the agreement of the debtor, may
depart from the “absolute priority” rule where such derogations are necessary in order to achieve the objectives of the plan
and if the plan does not unduly prejudice (ne porte pas une atteinte excessive aux) the rights or interests of the Affected
Parties. In particular, suppliers essential to the debtor's business, Equity Holders or holders of claims arising from the
debtor’s tort liability are eligible for special treatment.

The court’s decision constitutes an approval of the changes to the share capital or to the rights of the Equity Holders or to
the articles of association provided for by the plan. The court may appoint a judicial mandataire to register in the debtor’s
books the changes to the share capital and to carry out all acts necessary for the implementation of such amendments.


-----

As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during
which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of
without court consent.

If no proposed safeguard plan is adopted by the classes of affected parties, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the
court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or the public prosecutor, convert the safeguard proceedings into
judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the
safeguard proceedings would certainly lead the debtor to shortly becoming insolvent.

At the latest within ten days from the vote of the classes on the draft plan, any affected party having voted against the draft
plan and considering that:

(i) the best interest test criterion has not been met; or

(ii) in the event of a plan adopted by a cross-class cram-down and, based on the valuation of the debtor as a going

concern, either (or both) of the following conditions has not been met:

(a) in the event that the plan was approved solely by the vote of an affected class that was not an equity holder,

such class would not have been entitled to a payment if the order of payment in a judicial liquidation were
applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or, a court-ordered sale plan;

(b) in the event that a class, or classes, of equity holders voted against the plan, such class(es) would not have

received a payment or retained an interest in the event that the order of payment applicable in a judicial
liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or, of a court-ordered sale plan, may dispute
the same in court. Following a hearing and after receiving the public prosecutor’s opinion, the court will, in
the same decision, determine the value of the debtor (in respect of which the court is entitled to order the
appointment of an expert) and rule on compliance with the aforementioned conditions and on the adoption of
the plan.

This decision may itself be challenged within ten days of its notification or communication to them, by the affected
party(ies) that initially challenged the class vote, the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative
or the public prosecutor.

In the event no safeguard plan is adopted through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by approval by the
classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down), there is no statute that allows French courts to impose a term-
out (i.e., a rescheduling over a maximum period of 10 years of the indebtedness of dissenting creditors) although the courts
retain this power under statute if the plan is adopted under the standard consultation procedure (i.e., if no classes are formed
and, in judicial reorganization proceedings, in case of failure of the class-based consultation (see section “Court-
_administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings” below))._

_Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions:_ Public creditors (financial administrations, social security and
unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to those that
would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public
creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security
interests. Public creditors are consulted under specific conditions, within the framework of a local administrative committee
(Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards
indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard_**

The 2021 Ordinance introduced redesigned accelerated safeguard proceedings, by merging the previously existing
accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.


-----

A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings
(procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) enabling it to implement a restructuring plan in an expedited fashion through a class-
based consultation.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings the debtor must fulfil the following conditions:

        - its accounts must be certified by its statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by its chartered
accountant (expert-comptable);

        - it must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the opening of accelerated safeguard
proceedings;

        - it must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially requested the opening of conciliation;

        - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a position to
overcome; and

        - it must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern supported
by enough of the Affected Parties involved in the proceedings to render likely its adoption within a maximum of
four months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings (provided that the court has
decided to extend the initial two-month duration of the accelerated safeguard proceedings).

If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require classes of Affected Parties (see above) to be constituted, the court
shall order such constitution in the opening decision, as the opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings is subject to the
constitution of such classes.

The opening of the accelerated safeguard proceedings only has effect with regards to the Affected Parties (i.e. those parties
directly affected by the draft safeguard plan prepared by the debtor in the context of its conciliation proceedings).

Where the debtor's accounts show that the nature of the indebtedness makes it likely that a plan can be adopted only by
creditors having the status of financing companies, credit institutions and similar entities, as well as by all holders of a
claim acquired from such financial institutions or from a supplier of goods or services and, if applicable, bondholders, the
debtor may request the opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings, the effects of which are limited to these creditors.

The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard proceedings apply, any
amounts (including interest) in respect of debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the
commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in
consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement non-privileged debts). Such
amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms.

The regime applicable to accelerated safeguard is broadly the regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings (for
example, creditors will be consulted by way of a classes of Affected Parties-based consultation on a draft accelerated
safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde accélérée).

However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in
accelerated safeguard proceedings.

The plan adopted in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in
classes of Affected Parties consultation of standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for debt rescheduling,
debt write-offs and conversion of debt into equity capital in the debtor. The court cannot impose any debt rescheduling in
the context of the accelerated safeguard proceedings.

If a plan is not adopted by the classes of Affected Parties and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the
court shall terminate the proceedings.


-----

The list of claims (which shall also mention the subordination agreements communicated to the debtor by the creditors
prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings) of creditors party to the conciliation proceeding certified by the statutory
auditor or by a chartered accountant (expert-comptable) shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the
purpose of the accelerated safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see
below).

**_Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_**

_General_

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) may be initiated
against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent (en cessation des paiements) and, for liquidation proceedings only, if the
debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court considers that judicial
liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, after having heard the debtor, the court may order the commencement
of the proceedings which it finds most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of
judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considers that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate.

In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire), the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor or (at its own
initiative, the court may order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or convert judicial
reorganization proceedings into liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. In
all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’
representative, the controllers, the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment
and the payment of creditors, in that order.

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital
of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

_Judicial Reorganization_

An administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor
during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the
debtor (by elaborating a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan, with the contribution
of the debtor), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor.

The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor to make management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be
empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration).

Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above),
subject to certain specificities. The rules relating to creditors consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the
judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event that at least one class of Affected Parties has rejected the
proposals made to it are the same subject to the following provisions:

        - in addition to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator can also request the constitution of classes of Affected
Parties in the case of debtors that do not meet the required size thresholds;

        - any Affected Party may submit an alternative draft plan which shall be reported on by the court-appointed
administrator and shall be submitted, together with the plan proposed by the debtor, to a vote of the classes of
Affected Parties provided that such alternative draft plan has been submitted to the debtor and the court-appointed
administrator at least 15 days before the date of the vote on the draft plan submitted by the debtor;


-----

        - if the draft reorganization plan or the plan provides for a change in the equity structure or share transfers, prior
approval clauses (clauses d’agrément) are deemed null and void;

        - a cross-class cram-down may also be requested by the court-appointed administrator with the agreement of an
Affected Party (meaning that that the cross-class cram-down mechanism can be used without the debtor’s
consent);

        - where the Classes of Affected Parties-based consultation applies and the court does not approve the plan, a new
plan must be prepared and standard consultation shall apply (including the court-imposed rescheduling described
in “—Court-Administered Proceedings – Safeguard” above for standard consultation of creditors).

At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization
plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of
the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business described below.

In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity to a
level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the
administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire en justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of
the shareholders which refuse to vote in favour of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification
of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan.

In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning
of the French Labour Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of the
company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment (iii) the modification
of the company's share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and
to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator
or of the public prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least 3
months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings
required to approve the modification of the company's share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have
refused such modification, the insolvency court may either:

      - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital
increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization
plan; or

      - order, in favour of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of
the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or
indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result
of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company's shareholder meetings, any
consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and
request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees.

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, is determined
by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold
their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. The
abovementioned mechanism is not applicable where a cross-class cram-down applies.

Law no. 2021-689 dated 31 May 2021 has introduced a new insolvency procedure available up until 2 June 2023, which is
entitled “procédure de traitement de sortie de crise” and can be summarised as accelerated and simplified judicial
reorganization proceedings for small undertakings (in terms of employees and turnover), whose purpose is the endorsement


-----

of a debt rescheduling (the eligibility criteria are yet to be detailed in an upcoming ministerial decree). As a result, its
regime will not be discussed further herein.

_Judicial liquidation_

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the
former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings
nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is
vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle
the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority
order for payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor
are no longer in charge of its management.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes of such liquidation scenario (both
of which are decided by the court without a vote of the creditors):

(i) a sale of the business plan (plan de cession) (in which case the court will usually appoint a judicial administrator

to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court
(three months, renewable once) (during which the rules of the observation period will generally apply) and
organize such sale of the business as a going concern), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law)
being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business). As part of the bids submitted to the court,
the third-party purchaser can cherry-pick assets (including the real estate assets)/jobs/contracts without the
liabilities pertaining to them (save exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the real
estate assets) is usually at a significant discount compared to their going-concern market value. The court will
tend to favor a credible sale plan that ensures the continuation of the business as a going-concern and the
preservation of jobs, over the payment of creditors.

Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors, including secured
creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating to release their
security interests. By way of exception:

(a) a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to creditors having granted

financing for the acquisition of assets, used as collateral for such creditors and included in the sale
of the business plan;

(b) the purchaser will be able to exercise the purchase option under a financial lease only if the

outstanding amounts under such lease are repaid (but within the limit of the value of the leased asset
as set by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, by the court); and

(c) only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over

inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgages over real estate assets) would
be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right (and therefore
in practice prevent its sale) until they are repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless an
agreement is reached with the relevant parties.

Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of several debtors
subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in different legal entities subject
to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred assets could be significantly less than their
going-concern market value; or

(ii) a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

                - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only));


-----

                - sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers
have been received, (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to
conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or

                - request, under the supervision of the supervisory judge, from all potential interested purchasers
to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the
bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed
before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such
process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied.

If the court adopts a sale of the business plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential
to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

When either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or
continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif), the court
terminates the proceedings. The court may also terminate such proceedings when the interest of the continuation of the
liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets and, in the event where there are
insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a _mandataire_ in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and
allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.

**_The Hardening Period (période suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings_**

The date of insolvency (date de cessation des paiements) is deemed to be the date of the court order commencing
proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18 months before the date of such court
order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the date of insolvency may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final
court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The date
of insolvency is important because it marks the beginning of the “période suspecte” (otherwise referred to as “hardening
period”), being the period between the date of insolvency and the court decision commencing the proceedings. Certain
transactions entered into during the hardening period are void as of right or voidable by the court.

_Void and Voidable Transactions_

Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may
constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include, notably,
transfers of assets for no or nominal consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal obligations of the debtor
significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments made in a manner
which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a
court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350
of the French Civil Code, any contractual security or contractual retention right granted over the assets of the debtor for
debts previously incurred unless they replace a previous security of at least an equivalent nature and scope and with the
exception of an assignment of a claim provided for in Article L. 313-23 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (cession
_Dailly) when it is made pursuant to a master assignment agreement entered into prior to the date of insolvency, any statutory_
mortgage (hypothèque légale) attached to judgments of condemnation constituted over the assets of the debtor for debts
previously incurred and provisional measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date
of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie)
(unless such transfer is made as security for debt incurred simultaneously), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie)
that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as a guarantee of debt incurred prior to such amendment, and
notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité).

Transactions voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration,
administrative seizure measures, notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie
_attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court determines that the creditor knew_
of the insolvency of the debtor. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations
of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d'insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial


-----

Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period.
Unlike with respect to void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to
decide whether or not it appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable.”

There is, in theory, no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard proceedings or accelerated safeguard proceedings
(assuming the proceedings are successful).

**_Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation_**
**_Proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the court-administered proceedings triggers (or gives
creditors the right to trigger) the acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which
the court does not order the continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract
are not enforceable against the debtor. Neither, in accordance with a decision of the French supreme court (cour de
_cassation) dated January 14, 2014, n°12-22.909, are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of_
an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of
reorganization proceedings” (case law which is likely to be extended to safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings).

However, the court-appointed officer can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it
believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. This possibility is excluded in the case of accelerated safeguard
proceedings.

Conversely, the court-appointed officer can, require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations
even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-petition
contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent
consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings,
however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued
operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a sale of the business plan (plan de cession) (which it may do for
a period of three months, renewable once), in which case the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of
the court decision adopting the sale of the business plan or on the date on which the continued operation of the business
ends.

      - During the observation period (and some of these rules continue to apply during the execution of the approved
plan):accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts
providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year, with respect to which, however, accrued interest
can no longer be compounded;

      - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to
specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by
the supervisory judge appointed by the court to recover assets (whether they be pledged, retained by a creditor
based on a retention right or constitute collateral in a security trust estate (patrimoine fiduciaire)for which recovery
is justified by the continued operation of the business);

      - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after commencement of the proceedings unless they are
incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/
goods provided to the debtor and have the prior approval of the supervisory judge, in which case they must be
paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement
of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that
they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire), or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the court-appointed trustee in charge of
supervising the implementation of the plan or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation
period;


-----

      - creditors (including in respect of a third party security granted by the debtor) may not initiate or pursue any
individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural
person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings ) with
respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal
action is:

          - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor
may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below);

          - to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or

          - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, including if such assets secure third-party
debt, except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial
foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset, whether tangible or
intangible, movable or immovable, is located in another Member State within the European Union, in
which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings
commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 Insolvency Regulation (provided no
secondary proceedings are commenced in such Member State). Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the
debtor’s assets located outside France and the EU would only be affected by the French insolvency
proceedings if they were to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless
provided otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party);

          - any increase in the scope of a contractual security or a contractual right of retention, by any means
whatsoever, by the inclusion of goods or rights, or by transfer of the debtor's assets or rights, is prohibited.
Any contrary provision, in particular relating to a transfer of property or rights of the debtor which have
not yet arisen on the date of decision commencing the proceedings, is unenforceable. However, the
increase in the scope may validly result from an assignment of a claim provided for in Article L. 313-23
of the Monetary and Financial Code when it is made pursuant to a master assignment agreement entered
into prior to the opening of the proceedings, or from an express derogation from this prohibition provided
for in the French Monetary and Financial Code or the French Insurance Code.

      - immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrats en cours), absent consent
to other terms of payment, will be required only in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings.

A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan adopted by the
court and of the provisions of a judicial reorganization plan.

In accelerated safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the Affected Parties that are subject to the accelerated
safeguard proceedings. Debts owed to other creditors continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of proceedings
must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court
decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four
months for creditors domiciled outside metropolitan France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement
non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two or four month period referred to above starts to run as from their
maturity date. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim and no proof of claim
has been filed yet, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing on the claim with the creditors’ representative
on behalf of the debtor. Creditors are allowed to ratify a proof of claim made on their behalf until the supervisory judge
rules on the admissibility of the claim. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period, whose
claims are not deemed filed with the creditors’ representative are, except with respect to limited exceptions, barred from
receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are
preferential creditors under French law.


-----

Creditors secured by security interests granted by the debtor to secure third parties’ obligations also have to comply with
the proof of claim filing process.

Under accelerated safeguard proceedings the claims held by Affected Parties that took part in the conciliation proceedings
are listed by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor (or, in its absence, its accountant) and are thus deemed to have
been filed. This list should include among other information, the subordination agreements brought to the debtor’s attention
by the creditors before the opening of the proceeding. Although such Affected Parties can file proofs of claim pursuant to
the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust the amounts of their
claims as set forth on the list prepared by the debtor (within the 2 or 4-month time limit). Those Affected Parties who did
not take part in the conciliation proceedings would have to file their proofs of claim within the above-mentioned deadlines.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the
plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. The court can also set a time period during which the assets that it
deems to be essential to the continued business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

If the court adopts a sale of the business plan (plan de cession) in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings,
the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If
the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator (usually the former
creditor’s representative) in charge of managing the debtor, selling the assets of the debtor and settling the relevant debts
in accordance with their ranking. However, in practice, where the sale of the business is considered, the court will usually
appoint a judicial administrator to manage the debtor during the temporary continuation of the business operations (see
above) and organize the sale of the business process.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees (for the super-
privileged part of their claims), post-petition legal costs (essentially, fees of the officials appointed by the court), creditors
who benefit from the New Money Lien, creditors who benefit from the Post-Money Lien, privileged post-petition creditors,
certain pre-petition secured creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation
proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-
commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to
creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.

_Creditor Liability_

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code as interpreted by case law, where court-administered
proceedings have been commenced, creditors may be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to
the debtor only if the granting of such facilities was wrongful and, in the case of (i) fraud, (ii) interference with the
management of the debtor or (iii) if the security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such
facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on
any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court.

If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company’s management, it can be deemed a de facto manager of such company
(dirigeant de fait). In such case, Article L. 651-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that, if liquidation proceedings
(liquidation judiciaire) have been commenced against the debtor, the creditor may be liable for bearing the excess of
liabilities over the company’s assets, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case may be, if it
is established that their mismanagement has contributed to the company’s shortfall of assets. If such conditions are met,
French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part of the shortfall amount.

However, a manager (whether _de jure or de facto) cannot be held liable on the basis of Article L. 651-2 of the French_
Commercial Code in cases of “simple negligence” (simple négligence) in the management of the company.

**_Covid-19 Temporary Framework_**

In the context of COVID-19 epidemic and the state of health emergency and lock-down measures that have been imposed
in France, it should be noted that recourse to court-assisted proceedings and court-administered proceedings has been more


-----

difficult during the _lock-down period._ Therefore, ordinance n°2020-596 of March 27, 2020, ordinance no. 2020-341 of
May 20, 2020 (as modified by Article 124 of French law n°2020-1525 of December 7, 2020) and ordinance n°2020-1443
of November 25, 2020 (together, the “Covid-19 Temporary Framework”) temporarily adapt the procedures for dealing
with businesses which are facing difficulties to take account of the conditions under which they are implemented during
the sanitary emergency (état d’urgence sanitaire) and in the months following its cessation. In particular, it encourages the
use of court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc and conciliation) and lengthens the timeframe for court-administered
proceedings. Some of the provisions of these ordinances remain applicable until December 31, 2021.

Some others of those measures initially adopted by the Covid-19 Temporary Framework have been included in the 2021
Ordinance and are therefore no longer temporary.

_Enhanced effectiveness of conciliation proceedings_

The Covid-19 Temporary Framework implement measures aimed at considerably enhancing the efficiency of conciliation
proceedings.

The duration of conciliation proceedings can be increased, at the request of the conciliator, once or several times, provided
that the maximum duration of conciliation proceedings shall not exceed 10 months (instead of a maximum of four months,
extendable up to a maximum of five months, previously).

Until December 31, 2021, if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the
conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the debtor in conciliation may
apply to the president of the court which ordered the commencement of the procedure, in ex parte proceedings, for the
duration of the conciliation proceedings:

      - to stay or prohibit any legal action by a creditor with a view to order the debtor to pay a sum of money or to
terminate a contract for non-payment of a sum of money;

      - to stay or prohibit any enforcement proceedings by a creditor on both movable and immovable property, as well
as any distribution proceedings which have not become fully effective prior to the application; and

      - to defer or reschedule creditors’ claims which are due and payable.

These measures may be combined with the request for grace periods under Articles 1343-5 of the French Civil Code, as
already provided for in Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code (see “—Grace Periods” above) even before the
creditor sends any notice to pay or initiates any suit for payment if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the
conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim.

_Provisions to facilitate the adoption of a safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) or a judicial reorganization plan (plan de_
_redressement)_

The adoption of a safeguard or judicial reorganization plan is facilitated and accelerated by:

      - shortening the timelines for consulting creditors on the draft plan as part of a Standard consultation to 15 days, at
the request of the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the judicial administrator (administrateur
_judiciaire), with the authorization of the supervisory judge (juge commissaire);_

      - reducing the formalities for consulting creditors: proposals for the settlement of debts as well as any responses to
these proposals may be communicated by any means enabling the creditors’ representative (mandataire
_judiciaire) to establish with certainty the date of their receipt;_

      - the elaboration of the plan exceptionally based on outstanding liabilities estimated on the basis of a certificate
from the chartered-accountant (expert-comptable) or statutory auditor, on admitted, uncontested and identifiable
claims (those for which the deadline for filing has not expired).


-----

These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings up to and including December 31, 2021.

_Provisions aimed at facilitating the implementation of a safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) and a judicial reorganization_
_plan (plan de redressement)_

The Covid-19 Temporary Framework provides for provisions to facilitate the implementation of safeguard and judicial
reorganization plans by:

      - increasing by a maximum of two years the duration of the execution of the safeguard or judicial reorganization
plans (i.e. a maximum duration of 12 years or 17 years in the agricultural sector) with possible deviation from the
obligation to pay an annual instalment of 5% minimum as from year 3 and possible application of grace periods
provisions (see above “Grace Periods”) within the limit of the new term of the plan so extended;

      - increasing to a maximum period of 12 years the duration of the plan in case of substantial modification of the
plan;

      - deeming failure to reply from creditors consulted for the modification of the plan to be acceptance of the proposed
new payment terms.

These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings and until and including December 31, 2021.

_Provisions to facilitate the sale of the business_

Adjustments relating to the sale of the business have been provided by the Covid-19 Temporary Framework and in
particular, a reduction in the notice period required to convene the contracting parties provided for in Article R. 642-7 of
the French Commercial Code from 15 to 8 days in the event of a plan for the sale of the business (this notice period may
however be modified by decree pursuant to Article 10 of ordinance dated May 20, 2020).

These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings and until and including December 31, 2020.

_Limitations on Guarantees_

The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to:

      - certain exceptions, including to the extent any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute prohibited financial
assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code or would constitute a misuse
of corporate assets within the meaning of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code,
it being specified that, under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing
indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition; and

      - a contractual financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the Offering of the Notes
(including any additional Notes) which the Issuer has (i) applied for the direct or indirect benefit of each French
Guarantor and/or the directly or indirectly controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor through the
intercompany loans, cash pooling arrangements or similar arrangements that are outstanding on the date a payment
is requested to be made by such French Guarantor or (ii) used to refinance (directly or indirectly) any indebtedness
previously on-lent directly or indirectly to a French Guarantor or its directly or indirectly controlled subsidiaries
through the intercompany loans or similar arrangements and that are, in each case, outstanding on the date a
payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could subordinate or void any guarantee or security and, if payment had
already been made under the relevant guarantee or security, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant
guarantor or security provider, if the court found that the guarantor or security provider did not derive an overall corporate
benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee or security as a whole. The existence of a real and adequate


-----

corporate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are
matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, the Guarantees by the French Guarantors are limited to amounts recoverable thereunder that represent either
(i) the amount of debt made available directly or indirectly to that French Guarantor or its direct or indirect subsidiaries
with the proceeds of Indebtedness previously incurred by a holding company of such French Guarantor to the extent that
such Indebtedness is or has been refinanced directly or indirectly with the proceeds of Indebtedness of the Issuer
constituting Secured Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), which term includes the Notes offered hereby
(See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—The Guarantees”; and “Description of the Senior Notes—The
_Guarantees”); and (ii) the amounts of the Notes proceeds on-lent, directly or indirectly, to such French Guarantor, and the_
directly or indirectly controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor, through the intercompany loans, via the Group’s
cash-pooling arrangements or otherwise, and in each case, outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by
such French Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its guarantee or
under the intercompany loans or the cash pooling arrangements will reduce the maximum amount of its guarantee.

The amount secured by any Collateral which is granted by any such French Guarantor (or any other guarantor which is
incorporated in France) will likewise be limited by the amount which it is so able to guarantee.

By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts
payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—The Guarantees”; and “Description of the Senior Notes—The Guarantees”.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the
economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s-length basis, the difference
between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain
circumstances.

_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral_

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through
certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on the Collateral securing the
Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take
the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security
Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the
securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist
of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are
registered. The securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration
_de nantissement de compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of_
pledge will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre
_de mouvement de titres) of each French Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are_
not publicly registered (such as pledges over securities account), with the result that no assurance can be given on the
priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered.

_Limitation on Enforcement of Security Interests_

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations and may only be enforced following a
payment default (including following acceleration) and up to the secured amount that is due and remaining unpaid.

Under French law, generally speaking, pledges over assets may be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i)
before a court (a) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the
secured creditors) or (b) by way of the judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets; or (ii) by way of
contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which the secured
creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets.


-----

If the secured creditors choose enforcement by way of foreclosure (whether judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure),
the secured liabilities will be deemed extinguished up to the value of the attributed assets. Such value is determined either
by the judge in the context of a judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or by an expert (pre-contractually agreed or
appointed by a judge) in the context of a contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire). In case of enforcement by way of
foreclosure (whether judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), if the value of the pledged assets exceeds the amount
of the secured liabilities, the secured creditors will be required to pay the relevant pledgor a cash amount (“soulte”) equal
to the difference between the value of the pledged assets as so determined and the amount of the secured liabilities. This is
true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the
Collateral. On the contrary, if the value of such pledged assets is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant
amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such pledged assets, and the
remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could also be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable
law. Since such public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern, however, it is
possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of our group as a going concern.

In addition, in view of the area of activity of the Group or certain members of the Group, it should be noted that foreign
investments in companies or businesses which operate in certain sectors (notably where their activities relate to equipment,
products or services which are critical to the interests of France in terms of public order, public safety or national security,
in particular in the areas of public health, energy and water supply, public transport and electronic communication) may
require the prior authorization of the French authorities. This requirement may interfere with the enforcement of the
Collateral consisting of shares or a business.

Where any of the above sectors are involved, the following shall constitute foreign investments which are subject to the
prior authorization procedure:

A transaction as a result of which a non-EU investor (i) acquires control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the
French Commercial Code), (ii) acquires all or part of a business activity (branche d’activité) or (iii) crosses, directly or
indirectly, whether acting alone or in concert, the threshold of 25% of the voting rights, in each case of an entity governed
by French law.

A transaction as a result of which an EU investor (i) acquires control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French
Commercial Code) or (ii) acquires all or part of a business activity, in either case of an entity governed by French law.

A transaction as a result of which a French investor under non-French control, or a French ultimate investor with a foreign
investor within its chain of control, acquires all or part of a business of an entity governed by French law and which is
active in a strategic sector.

When a foreign investment is subject to the authorization of the French authorities as above, the transaction cannot be
completed prior to authorization. The foreign investor must submit a formal application for prior authorization to the French
authorities, which shall render a decision within a period of 30 business- days of receipt of the application, followed by a
second 45-business-day period if further examination is deemed necessary. In the absence of answer at the end of the said
period, the authorization request will be deemed rejected.

_Security Agent_

Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code allow the creation of security interests and personal guarantees for
the direct benefit of a security agent, which will hold such rights separately from its own estate. As a result, the rights of
secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees will be ring fenced if the security agent is the subject of
insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in cases of the exercise of a right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor).
The security agent will remain liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties. The
security agent can take all legal actions to protect the secured creditor’s interests and file a receivable on behalf of one or
several creditors in a debtor’s insolvency proceeding. The security agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement
specifying its quality, its duties, the duration of its duties and its powers.


-----

_Parallel Debt_

Under French law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the creditor be the
same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of the creditors by third parties who do not hold the secured
claim, unless they act as trustees (fiduciaires) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des
_sûretés) under Article 2488-6 of the French Civil Code, (which will be the case here for the Security Documents governed_
by French law). The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In
order to permit the holders of the Notes to benefit indirectly from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations
of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all
times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the
Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall
discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to such Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder
of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not
directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the
Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent
(even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). Although the French
Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has held (in a decision dated September 13, 2011 (Cass. Com. 13 September 2011 n°
10-25.533 Belvédère) rendered in the context of safeguard proceedings opened in France) that, subject to certain conditions
being met, the concept of “parallel debt” governed by the laws of the State of New York was not incompatible with the
French law concept of international public policy (ordre public international), this decision cannot be considered as a
general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt obligation
and no assurance can be given that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be
noted that the legal issue addressed by the Belvedere decision is limited to the proof of claims. The French Supreme Court
was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a “parallel debt”. It should be noted that case law on
this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will
eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the Security Interests in the Collateral
created under the Parallel Debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive
any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the Collateral.

Further, under a parallel debt structure, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency
or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

_Trustee_

Pledges governed by French law will be granted to the benefit of the Trustee as trustee for the holders of the Notes in
accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture, and may therefore
not directly be granted to holders of the Notes. A concept of “trust” has been recognized for tax purposes by Article 792-0
_bis of the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has held, in the Belvédère decision referred_
to above in respect of the parallel debt concept, that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the
State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in France. However, while
substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the La Haye Convention of July 1, 1985 on the
law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under
French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Trustee are successfully
challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an
enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated
with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee

_Recognition of Validity of Second or Lower Ranking Financial Securities Account Pledges by French courts_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second or lower ranking pledges
over financial securities accounts.


-----

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over the relevant
financial securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such company are
registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over
securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority
of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a company are registered.

French courts never expressly recognised to our knowledge the concept of lower ranking pledges over the same financial
securities account and therefore, up until Ordinance no. 2021-1192 dated 15 September 2021 amending the rules governing
French law security (the 2021 French Security Ordinance), which will come into effect on 1 January 2022, no assurances
could be given that such lower ranking pledges would be upheld by French courts.

The 2021 French Security Ordinance provides clarification on the ranking of multiple pledges over the same financial
securities account, introducing a new section I bis to Article L. 211-20 of the French Monetary and Financial Code.
According to such new provisions, creditors benefiting from multiple pledges over the same financial securities account
shall be ranked according to the date on which the financial securities account statement of pledge (déclaration de
_nantissement) has been signed. In case of multiple pledges over the same financial securities account, the pledgor in the_
name of which the pledged securities account is opened or any beneficiary of such a pledge shall notify that pledge to the
entity in the books of which the relevant pledged securities account is held (i.e. the company issuing such financial
securities or any intermediary referred to in Article L. 211-3 of the French Monetary and Financial Code or a credit
institution).

_Assumptions as to the Enforceability of Second Ranking Pledges Over Receivables/Bank Accounts_

The pledges over receivables/bank accounts granted by the Issuer or the French Guarantors are governed by French law.
Under French law, a pledge over bank accounts is a pledge over the restitution receivable of the balance standing to credit
of the bank account.

In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over
receivables/bank accounts. As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the receivables/bank
accounts of a company.

Although French law does not currently expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over receivables/bank accounts from
granting a second ranking pledge over the same receivables/bank accounts, this structure has not been tested before the
French courts and no assurances can be given that such second ranking pledges would be upheld if tested before the 2021
French Security Ordinance comes into effect (i.e. on 1 January 2022). 2021 French Security Ordinance provides
clarification on the ranking of multiple pledges over the same receivable, introducing a new article 2361-1 into the French
Civil Code. According to such new article 2361-1, creditors benefiting from multiple pledges over the same receivable
shall be ranked according to the date on which such pledge has been granted. If a creditor benefiting from a lower ranking
pledge over a receivable receives payment from the debtor under that pledged receivable, creditors benefiting from a higher
ranking pledge over the same receivable shall have recourse against that lower ranking creditor.

_Fraudulent Conveyance_

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside insolvency proceedings,
the “action paulienne” provisions. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of
recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such person
guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such
person’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other
legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant person by the
creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire
_à l’exécution du plan) or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside_
insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against all the creditors of the relevant debtor
(if the claim was lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the commissioner of the safeguard or
reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan)) or the concerned creditor (if the claim was lodged by such


-----

creditor) if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or, (in the case of a
claim lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the commissioner of the safeguard or
reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan)) any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a
consequence of the act, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act
was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of
such person’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into
for no consideration (à titre gratuit), in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful
challenge on the grounds of fraudulent conveyance. If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the Security
Interests in the Collateral, or the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any
defence under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the Security Interests in the Collateral or the
granting of such guarantee could be declared unenforceable against all the creditors (if the claim was lodged by the
creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire)) or the commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire
_à l’exécution du plan) or the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful_
challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Guarantees or the Security Interests in the
Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, the Security
Interests in the Collateral or the Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly,
from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any
damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

_Assumptions as to the Validity of the Intercreditor Agreement_

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation)
on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor Agreement, except for Articles
L.626-30 and L. 628-7 of the French Commercial Code which states that the constitution of classes of Affected Parties
must comply with subordination agreements entered into by the Affected Parties before the commencement of the
safeguard (included accelerated safeguard) or judicial reorganization proceedings, provided that the Affected Parties have
notified the existence of such subordination agreements to the court-appointed administrator within 10 days of the receipt
of the notice sent by the court-appointed administrator or the publication of such notice inviting the Affected Parties to
notify the existence of such subordination agreements. Otherwise, the subordination agreements would be unenforceable
in the context of the proceedings. As a consequence, except to the extent referred to above (which, as at the date of this
offering memorandum, has received no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect
to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Belgium**

**_Insolvency_**

Some Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Belgium (the “Belgian Guarantors”). To the extent any Belgian
Guarantor has its registered seat in Belgium or to the extent that Belgium is the territory in which the center of a Belgian
Guarantor’s main interests is situated, main insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium. This also applies to any
debtor for which Belgium is the territory in which the center of such debtor’s main interests is situated. Such proceedings
would then be governed by Belgian law. Under certain circumstances, the Insolvency Regulation and Belgian law also
allows territorial bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets of companies whose center of main
interests is not situated in Belgium. The effects of those territorial bankruptcy proceedings are restricted to the assets
situated in Belgium

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the main Belgian insolvency proceedings (as incorporated in Book
XX (“Insolvency of Undertakings”) of the Belgian Code of Economic Law, hereafter the “Belgian Insolvency Law”).
The Belgian Insolvency Law provides for two insolvency proceedings: judicial reorganization proceedings (gerechtelijke
_reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy proceedings (faillissement/faillite). Note that in addition, Belgian_
law allows for liquidation in deficit (deficitaire vereffening/liquidation déficitaire). The latter proceedings will not be
further discussed.


-----

_Judicial reorganization_

A debtor may (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor) file a petition
for judicial reorganization if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately or in the future. If the net assets
of the company have fallen under 50% of the company’s registered capital, the continuity of the enterprise is presumed to
be at risk. A state of bankruptcy of the debtor does not exclude that a petition for judicial reorganization is filed.

As from the filing of the petition with the competent commercial court overseeing the judicial reorganization and for as
long as such court has not issued a judgment thereon, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt (save in case the debtor files
a declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court order. Furthermore, during this period, with limited exceptions,
none of the debtor’s assets may be realized by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests
that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets. The filing of the petition does not, however, have a suspensory
effect if the debtor requested the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings less than six months ago (unless the court
decides otherwise).

Within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the court will examine such petition, and within 8 days
following such examination and subject to the satisfaction of the filing conditions, the court may decide to open the judicial
reorganization procedure, thereby, granting a temporary moratorium to the debtor for a period of maximum six months. At
the request of the debtor (or of the judicial administrator in case of a procedure of transfer under judicial authority) and
pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended (once or several
times) up to a total maximum period of twelve months as from the judgment opening the judicial reorganization. In
exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure
on employment), and in the interest of the creditors, the court may order an additional extension of the moratorium period
for six months. Special rules apply when a debtor has already requested and obtained a judicial reorganization procedure
in the last 3 years before the new request.

The granting of the temporary moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to pre-existing claims
(i.e. for debts incurred before the judgment opening the judicial reorganization proceedings) in the moratorium can be
continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s moveable and immovable assets from the time that the moratorium is
granted until the end of the period, with limited exceptions. During the moratorium, no attachments can be made with
regard to pre-existing claims. During the moratorium, the debtor can also not be declared bankrupt, except upon declaration
of the debtor itself and, if the debtor is a legal entity, judicial dissolution will not be possible during this period.

Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their conservatory character,
but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect on the situation of
the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of moveable or immoveable property has already been set, such sale
may, under certain conditions, be continued.

If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization proceedings,
such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium (provided the receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from
the moment the pledge is created) (note that a pledge of a business or other universality including receivables is not
considered as a pledge specifically with respect to receivables), and the holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to
take enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (e.g., the debtor’s customers) during
the moratorium. A pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Law of December
15, 2004, as amended (Wet Financiële Zekerheden/Loi sur les Sûretés Financières) (the “Belgian Financial Collateral
**Law”) can be enforced notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, subject to limited**
exceptions. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the
enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co debtors, subject to certain exceptions
or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary
payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of
the enterprise. However, in respect of an enforcement over pledged cash falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial
Collateral Law, the enforcement prohibition applies, with limited exceptions (notably in the event of a payment default),


-----

if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the
meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Law or (ii) a public or financial legal entity but the creditor is not such an
entity.

During judicial reorganization proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor continue to exercise their
management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. However, upon request of the debtor, the court
may appoint, a company mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/médiateur d’entreprise) to assist the debtor during the
moratorium and to facilitate the reorganization of the company or of all or part of its assets or activities. The court may
also appoint a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice), upon request of any interested party or
the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings of the debtor or any of its corporate bodies threatening
the continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities and provided such measure can preserve such
continuity, to either exercise particular tasks indicated by the court, or to replace the debtor or any of its corporate bodies
for the duration of the moratorium. In addition, in the event of manifestly gross error or manifest bad faith, a court appointed
temporary director (voorlopig bestuurder/administrateur provisoire) may be appointed.

The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the initiation
of the judicial reorganization proceedings does not terminate any contracts, and contractual provisions which provide for
the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure, and
certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Such enforcement
prohibition applies, with a few exceptions, to close-out netting provisions as well, if the judicial reorganization procedure
affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral
Law or (ii) a public or financial legal entity but where the creditor is not such an entity. Moreover, the Belgian Insolvency
Law provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the
reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such default within a 15-day period following the notification of such
default.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract during the
reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and that such default is necessary for the debtor
to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the enterprise or its assets. The exercise
of this right does however not prevent the creditor from suspending in turn the performance of its own obligations. The
creditor can however not terminate the agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the performance of
its own obligations.

_Judicial reorganization by collective agreement, by amicable settlement or by court ordered transfer of enterprise_

Judicial reorganization proceedings may result in an amicable settlement between the debtor and two or more of its
creditors, a collective agreement or a transfer of (part of) its activities.

The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the court and all
parties involved. In the case of an amicable settlement, only the parties to such amicable settlement will be bound by the
terms they have agreed. Such in-court agreement requires unanimity among the creditors concerned. The debtor may
petition the court to grant grace periods in respect of its payment obligations, e.g., in relation to interest payments, pending
the negotiation of the agreement. Once agreement is reached, the court will record it. Such an amicable settlement will
remain enforceable in the event of a later bankruptcy, subject to certain exceptions. The court order confirming the
existence of an amicable settlement will be published, without disclosing the content of the agreement, and its terms will
only be binding upon the creditors that have agreed to it.

In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a reorganization plan during the
reorganization procedure. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest
obligations and the swap of debt into equity (the Belgian Insolvency Law contains certain limitations, primarily in view of
protecting employees of the debtor) and may be based on a differentiated treatment of certain various categories of
liabilities. It must be filed with the electronic registry managed by the Belgian bar association (www.regsol.be) at least 20
days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan. The court needs to
ratify the reorganization plan prior to it taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the creditors


-----

(both in headcount and in value of the claims) and by the court will bind all creditors, including those who voted against it
or did not vote. The reorganization plan can bind creditors who have a contractual lien over specific assets, pledgees,
mortgagees and the so -called creditor-owners, provided that (i) interest is paid on the principal amount of their outstanding
debts, and (ii) their rights are not suspended for more than 24 months as of the ratification of the collective agreement by
the court. No other measures can be imposed on such creditors without their individual agreement. The court may refuse
ratification if the conditions of the judicial reorganization act were not met, or if the proposed reorganization plan violates
public policy.

Within a period of eight days following the judgment opening the judicial reorganization proceedings, the debtor must
inform each of its creditors individually of the amount of its claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the
debtor, as well as of the capacity of the creditor as extraordinary creditor and of details regarding security interests, if
applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can
challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor at the latest one month prior to the day
on which the creditors vote on the reorganization plan. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of
such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure, or definitively, on the condition that it
has jurisdiction in that respect but that the decision relating to the dispute cannot be taken in a sufficiently short time frame.
In addition, the court can at any moment, in the event of absolute necessity and upon the request of the debtor or the
creditor, change its decision determining the amount or the ranking of the claim on the basis of new elements. If a creditor
has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month in advance of the date on which the creditors
will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as
well as for the purposes of the reorganization plan.

The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the assistance of the court
appointed judicial administrator or company mediator, as the case may be. The plan may include measures such as the
reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity and may be based on a
limited (justified) differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities.

The court ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its petition or at a later
stage in the procedure. It may also be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or by any party who has an interest
in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court can order such transfer in specific circumstances.

The court-ordered transfer will be organized by one or more judicial administrators. Following the transfer, the recourse
of the creditors will in most cases be limited to the transfer price.

_Pre-pack_

On 11 March 2021, the Belgian Parliament adopted a new law amending the Belgian Insolvency Law introducing a number
of new measures, most notably a “pre-packaged insolvency” (voorbereidend akkoord/accord préparatoire) procedure,
where the debtor may discretely prepare for judicial reorganisation proceedings under the supervision of a judicial
administrator. These measures were initially adopted for a limited period ending on 30 June 2021. By Royal Decree
implementing the extension of Articles 2, 4 to 12 of the Act of 21 March 2021 amending Book XX of the Economic Code
and the Income Tax Code 1992, the Belgian government decided to extend these measures until 16 July 2022.

The purpose of the pre-packaged insolvency (Pre-pack) procedure is to confidentially test the possibility of an amicable
or collective arrangement with a debtor’s most important creditors prior to formal insolvency proceedings.

This occurs during a Pre-pack phase, ie a courtsupervised preparatory negotiation phase. If the negotiations in this Pre-
pack phase are successful, the Pre-pack phase will be converted into the public judicial reorganisation proceedings (aimed
at obtaining either an amicable agreement with two or more creditors, or a collective reorganisation agreement that is
approved by the majority of creditors representing the majority of the claims and binding on dissenting creditors).

This new process consists of the following features. A debtor may initiate the Pre-pack procedure by filing a petition with
the President of the competent enterprise court, substantiating that its continuity is at risk immediately or in the short term.


-----

To ensure confidentiality, the petition is “unilateral” (meaning that creditors are not summoned to share their views on the
petition) and will be decided upon by the President in a hearing behind closed doors (held within 8 days from the date of
the petition). The subsequent decision of the President is not published in the Belgian Official State Gazette. Opposition
by third parties is not possible.

If the President decides to refuse the Pre-pack petition, the debtor may appeal such decision within 8 working days after
being notified of that decision.

If the President decides to approve the Pre-pack petition, the President will appoint a judicial administrator (who may be
proposed by the debtor and who may continue to act in the following judicial reorganisation procedure (i.e. the opening of
a judicial reorganisation (as set described hereafter) does not as such have a terminating effect on the mandate of the
appointed judicial administrator)). After the appointment of the judicial administrator (which is again not published), the
debtor must produce a list of creditors and disclose this to the judicial administrator.

The judicial administrator will subsequently assist the debtor in negotiating an amicable agreement, or a collective
restructuring plan with either all or some of the creditors.

During the Pre-pack phase, the debtor remains in control and may terminate the Pre-pack procedure at any time.

If the negotiations conducted by the judicial administrator are successful, the President of the enterprise court will refer the
matter to the insolvency chamber of the enterprise court for the formal opening of judicial reorganisation proceedings.
Subsequently, an amicable agreement might be sanctioned (“homologated”) by the court, or the collective restructuring
plan might be put to the creditors’ vote.

Once referred, the judicial reorganisation proceedings are carried out in an expedited manner. Within 5 working days after
referral, the enterprise court will initiate formal judicial reorganisation proceedings.

In the event of an amicable agreement, the enterprise court will decide on confirming or rejecting the amicable settlement
within one month.

In the event of a collective restructuring agreement, the creditors will vote on a restructuring plan and the court will decide
on confirming or rejecting the collective agreement within 3 months.

At the request of the judicial administrator, during the Pre-pack procedure, the President of the enterprise court may subject
unwilling or malicious creditors to payment terms and/or payment conditions as well as stay enforcement measures for a
maximum period of four months.

As soon as the matter is referred to the insolvency chamber of the enterprise court, the debtor-company will enjoy the full
suspension period (moratorium) offered by the formal judicial reorganisation proceedings (ie during which enforcement
measures against the company’s assets – for debts incurred before the opening of the judicial reorganisation proceedings –
will be suspended).

**_Bankruptcy_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors or upon the initiative of the Public Prosecutor’s
office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets, by the liquidator of the debtor’s assets or by the liquidator of
‘main insolvency proceedings’ opened in another EU member state (other than Denmark) in accordance with the
Insolvency Regulation. Once the court ascertains that the requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a
date by which all creditors’ claims must be submitted to the court for verification.

Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/declaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a situation of
sustained cessation of payments (op duurzame wijze opgehouden hebben te betalen/cessation de paiements de manière
_persistante) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/ébranlement du crédit). Cessation of payments_
is generally considered as the inability of the debtor to pay its debts as they fall due. Such situation must be persistent and


-----

not merely temporary. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the
bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for the
operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors
and the liquidation of the debtor.

In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The

implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor.
Subject to what follows, the rights of creditors in the process are in principle limited to being informed of the course of the
bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the bankruptcy receiver. Creditors may oppose to the sale of assets by
bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary continued operation of the business.

The bankruptcy receiver must decide whether or not to temporarily continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e.,
contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor,
provided the bankruptcy receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice
to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply:

      - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early
termination or acceleration event; and

      - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element_
upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is
no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can however agree to continue to perform
under such contracts.

The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party which are still to be performed after
the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the bankruptcy if such decision is
necessary for the management and the liquidation of the bankrupt estate. The counterparty to an ongoing contract may
summon the bankruptcy receiver to take a decision within 15 days. If no extension of the 15 days term is agreed upon or if
the bankruptcy receiver does not take any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration
of the 15 days term. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim
will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract
dissolved. The counterparty may not seek injunctive relief or require specific performance of the contract.

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court order opening
bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy receiver may proceed against the debtor and
liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account,
falling with the scope of the Belgian Financial Collateral Law. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate credits
(boedelschulden / dettes de la masse).

For creditors with claims secured by movable assets (other than financial collateral), such suspension would normally be
limited to the period required for the verification of the claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension
period may be extended for up to one year as from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of
the court which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest of all
creditors without prejudicing the secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been given the
opportunity to be heard by the court. However, a pledge on financial instrument or cash held on accounts can be enforced
during the suspension period.

For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is necessary to pursue
the sale of the assets, subject to certain exceptions. The bankruptcy receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given
either at its request or at the request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the
enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the report of claims has been finalized. The court may suspend such enforcement
for a period of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a realization of the


-----

assets without prejudicing the mortgagee provided that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be heard by the
court.

If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an insolvency proceeding,
are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such security shall, in accordance with the EU
Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such insolvency proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its unsecured debt,
or debts secured by a general privilege, such as tax administration or social security debts.

The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The following is a
general overview of such rules:

      - Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the bankruptcy receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the
so-called “estate debts”, have a senior priority. In addition, if the bankruptcy receiver has contributed to the
realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the bankruptcy receiver in priority out of
the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors.

      - Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether by
means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization).

      - Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (e.g., tax claims, claims for social
security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the debtor. Certain
privileges prevail over the security interests.

      - _Pari passu: Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests and privileges have been_
satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the bankruptcy receiver among the unsecured
creditors who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated).

      - Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).

**_Limitations on Enforcement of the Notes, the Guarantees and Security Interests_**

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian company for the obligations of another group company must fall within
the grantor’s legal and corporate purpose and be for the own corporate benefit of the granting company.

If the granting of a guarantee or the creation of a security interest does not fall within the grantor’s corporate object, then
such guarantee or security interest could, upon certain conditions, be held null and void. The assessment of whether or not
the grant of a guarantee or security interest is in each of the Belgian guarantor’s own corporate interest, is largely dependent
on factual considerations and is to be determined on a case-by-case basis by the board of directors or director(s) of each of
the Belgian guarantors at the time of the granting of the guarantees, in anticipation of their enforcement and to be reviewed
ultimately on a case-by-case basis at the time of the enforcement by the competent courts. Consideration has to be given
to any direct and/or indirect benefit that such Belgian guarantor would derive from the transaction; this is particularly
relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees and security interests. It is generally considered by legal scholars that at
least the following principles apply to such evaluation: (i) the risk taken by the Belgian guarantor in issuing the guarantee
must be proportional to the direct and/or indirect benefit derived from the transaction; and (ii) the financial support granted
by the Belgian guarantor should not exceed its financial capabilities. The responsibility for such assessment lies with the
board of directors or manager(s) of the Belgian guarantors.

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the board of directors or director(s) of the Belgian guarantor may be held
liable (i) by the company for negligence in the management of the company and (ii) by third parties in tort and under
criminal law in certain specific circumstances, i.e. where the specific facts can be qualified as “abuse of company goods”
(misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de biens sociaux). Moreover, the guarantee or security interest could be
declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor that benefits from the guarantee or security interest


-----

may also be held liable on the basis of the principles of tort liability. Alternatively, the guarantee or security interest could
be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit and, under certain circumstances, the creditor could be
held liable on the basis of the principles of tort liability for any guarantee amount in excess of such amount. These rules
have however seldom been tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee or security interest to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect
parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market practice for
indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to
subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement (or
the accession documents thereto) will contain limitation language on the basis of which the total maximum guarantee
liabilities of certain Belgian guarantors (in case of an upstream or cross stream guarantee) under the Secured Debt
Documents (as described below) will be limited. The limitation language will be substantially as follows:

The liability of any Belgian Obligor under the guarantee provided in relation to the Senior Facilities Agreement and the
guarantee provided in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes for the obligations of any Obligor,
which is not a direct or indirect Subsidiary of that Belgian Obligor, will be limited to the greater of:

(i) an amount equal to 90 per cent. of the Net Assets of that Belgian Obligor calculated on the basis of its latest
available annual financial statements at the date on granting of the guarantee;

(ii) an amount equal to 90 per cent. of the Net Assets of that Belgian Obligor calculated on the basis of its latest
available annual financial statements at the date on which the relevant demand is made against it; and

(iii) the highest amount of On-Lending to the Belgian Obligor and its Subsidiaries at any time between the date of
granting of the guarantee and the date on which the relevant demand is made against it,

it being specified that, the amount resulting from the calculation referred to in paragraphs (i) to (iii) above shall apply
without double counting and on a pro rata basis to both (i) the guarantee provided under the Senior Facilities Agreement
and (ii) the guarantee provided in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes.

For the purpose of this paragraph:

Net Assets means the net assets of the relevant Belgian Obligor as calculated in accordance with the rules under the Belgian
Code of Companies and Associations to determine the amount available for distribution as dividend, and, in the event of a
dispute of the amount thereof, a certificate of such amount from the statutory auditor of the relevant Belgian Obligor (or,
if no statutory auditor is appointed or the statutory auditor refuses to issue such certificate, from an accountant appointed
upon the Agent’s request by the “Instituut van de Bedrijfsrevisoren/Institut des Réviseurs d’Entreprises”) shall be
conclusive, save in the case of manifest error.

On-Lending means, without double counting, the aggregate amount of all Loans made to any Obligor and made available
by any Obligor, directly or indirectly, to the relevant Belgian Obligor or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, irrespective
of whether retained or on-lent by that Belgian Obligor or its Subsidiary).

For the purpose of this section relating to the guarantees that will be granted by the Belgian guarantors, “Secured Debt
Documents” means the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Indentures, and any other related agreement having the benefit of
the Collateral.

The secured liabilities under the Security Documents granted by a Belgian guarantor will be subject to the same limitations.

**_Financial Assistance_**

Any guarantee or security interest granted by a Belgian Guarantor which constitutes a breach of the provisions on financial
assistance as defined by Article 5:152 or 7:227 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations, might not be
enforceable.


-----

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event that bankruptcy proceedings are governed by Belgian law, certain transactions may be declared ineffective
against third parties if concluded or performed by the debtor during the so-called “hardening period” (verdachte
_periode/période suspecte)._

In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition for filing for bankruptcy) is deemed to have occurred
as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on serious and objective
indications that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months
before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was
dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud
its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined as being the date of such decision to
dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred to
as the “hardening period”.

The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective against third
parties include, among others, (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions entered into at an undervalue or on extremely
beneficial terms for the counterparty, (ii) payments for debts which are not due (iii) payments other than in cash for debts
due, and (iv) security interests provided for pre-existing debts.

The Belgian bankruptcy receiver may request the court to declare payments of a Belgian Guarantor during the hardening
period for debts due ineffective against third parties provided that it can be proven that the creditor concerned was aware
of the cessation of payment of the company. If the guarantee or security interests granted by a Belgian Guarantor were
successfully held ineffective (based on the above), noteholders would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and would
be under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such guarantee or the realization of the security. Finally,
regardless of any declaration by the commercial court of a hardening period, transactions for which it can be demonstrated
that they have been entered into with fraudulent prejudice to a third creditor, may be declared ineffective against third
parties.

**_Recognition and Enforcement_**

The granting of security interests over movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, assets may be subject to validity
and/or enforceability conditions. The breach of any of such conditions may render such security interests invalid or
unenforceable. The foreclosure of security interests may be subject to formalities (e.g. judicial or non-judicial consent) and
may be time consuming in the event that the foreclosure takes place under judicial control or in the event of a legal dispute.
Courts may condition the enforcement of a security interest and/or guarantee upon the evidence that the creditor has a final
and undisputed claim triggering the foreclosure of the security interest and/or guarantee. Enforcement of security interests
and/or guarantees may be hindered by conflict of law and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and may not breach any public
policy provision and/or mandatory legal provisions. Courts may require a sworn translation in French or Dutch of the
English documents which they may review.

**Plan of Distribution**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) dated the date of this
offering memorandum by and among the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers, we have agreed to sell to each
Initial Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from us, together with all
other Initial Purchasers, the Additional Notes.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the
Additional Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Additional Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After
the initial offering of the Additional Notes, the offering prices and other selling terms of the Additional Notes may from
time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Sales in the United States may be made through certain
affiliates of the Initial Purchasers.

Persons who purchase Additional Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on
the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be
required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that during the period from the
date hereof through and including the date that is 60 days after the date hereof, we will not, and the Guarantors will not,
without the prior written consent provided for in the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose
of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that are substantially similar to the Notes.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act and may not be offered
or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities
Act and outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Terms
used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Resales of the Notes
are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions”.

Each Initial Purchaser represents warrants and agrees that it:

      - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated
any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA)
received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the
FSMA does not apply to us or the Guarantors; and

      - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in
relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise
made available to and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any securities to any retail investor in the EEA. For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article
4(1) MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering
or selling the Additional Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been or will be
prepared and therefore offering or selling the Additional Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor
in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that
any offer of Additional Notes (i) in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the
Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Additional Notes and (ii) the United
Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by


-----

virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of such
securities. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the Prospectus Regulation or the UK
Prospectus Regulation.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that the Notes are not intended to be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in
the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point
(8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU)
No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required
by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”)
for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been or will be
prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK
may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

Certain Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC and, therefore, may not make sales of any Notes
in the United States or except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. To the extent that such Initial
Purchasers intend to effect sales of the Notes in the United States, they will do so only through one or more U.S. registered
broker-dealers or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S. law.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold,
distributed or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a
customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the
Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering, selling
or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared
and therefore offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the
EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

Each of the Initial Purchasers has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made
available and will not offer, sell, distribute or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA or in
the UK. For the purposes of this provision:

      - the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

 a retail client as defined in point (11) of MiFID II; or

 a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

 not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation; and

      - the expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the
terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the
Notes.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial
Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering
memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required.
Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any
other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any


-----

country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction.
This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase Notes in any
jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum
comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of
this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

We and the Guarantors have also agreed that we will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose
of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would
cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbor of Rule 144A and
Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Additional Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We will apply, through our listing
agent, to list the Additional Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, however, we cannot assure you that the Additional
Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Additional Notes as permitted by applicable
law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Additional Notes, and any market-making
activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such
market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you
that any market for the Additional Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to
sell any Additional Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to the Notes and Guarantees”._

We expect that delivery of the Additional Notes will be made against payment on the Additional Notes on or about the
date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be eight business days (as such term is used for
purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, and, for the avoidance of doubt, including November 11, 2021 as a
business day, notwithstanding it being a local holiday in France) following the date of pricing of the Additional Notes (this
settlement cycle is being referred to as “T +8). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market
generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Additional Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the following
five business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed
settlement. Purchasers of the Additional Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the Offering, Natixis (the “Stabilizing Manager”), or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or
persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. The
Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position,
and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing
Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by
applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market
price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in
these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or
trading markets for, the Notes. “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees”.

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates
a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security
so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in
the open market after the distribution has been completed to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchaser
to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased
in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.


-----

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it
would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which
adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various activities,
which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management,
investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers
and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may currently and/or in the future perform, various
financial advisory, investment and corporate banking, commercial lending and banking, consulting and other commercial
services in the ordinary course of business for us and our affiliates, and may have from time to time in the past held, and
may in the future hold, positions in our or any of our affiliates’ securities or enter into hedging or general derivative
transactions with us or our affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they received or will receive customary
fees and commissions and reimbursement of expenses.

Our institutional investors, their respective controlling shareholders, or any of their respective affiliates, directors or officers
may purchase Additional Notes in the offering at a purchase price per Additional Note equal to the issue price set forth on
the cover page of this offering memorandum on the Additional Notes Issue Date or in the future. The Purchase Agreement
will not restrict the ability of our institutional investors, their respective controlling shareholders or any of their respective
affiliates, directors or officers to buy or sell Additional Notes on the Additional Notes Issue Date or in the future and, as a
result, our institutional investors, their respective controlling shareholders, or any of their respective affiliates, directors or
officers may buy or sell the Additional Notes on the Additional Notes Issue Date or in open market transactions at any time
following the consummation of the offering of the Additional Notes.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or
hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and
securities activities may involve our or our affiliates’ securities and/or instruments (directly, as collateral securing other
obligations or otherwise). The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations
and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and at any time may hold,
or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. In particular,
certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and
Natixis is facility agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid
with a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Additional Notes.

If any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us or our affiliates, certain of those Initial
Purchasers or their affiliates may routinely hedge their credit exposure to our or our affiliates in a manner consistent with
their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure
by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions
in our or our affiliates’ securities, including potentially the Additional Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps
or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Additional Notes offered hereby.

by us or any Initial Purchaser.

For so long as the Notes remain outstanding and are “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the
U.S. Securities Act, we will, during any period in which we are neither subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange
Act, nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) of the U.S. Exchange Act, upon written request of a holder or
beneficial owner of the Notes, furnish to such holder or beneficial owner or to the Trustees or any relevant paying agent
for delivery to such holder or beneficial owner or prospective purchaser of the Notes, as the case may be, the information
required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act, to permit compliance with Rule 144A
thereunder in connection with resales of the Notes. Any such request should be directed to the Issuer at their registered
addresses at 114, route de Rouffach, 68000 Colmar, France and 53 rue Nationale, 67160 Wissembourg, France. Copies of
the Indenture, the forms of the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Paying Agency Agreement and the Security
Documents will be made available upon request to the Issuer at the addresses above.

We are not currently, and we will not be, subject to the periodic reporting and other information.

**Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgments**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of France and the Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the law of France
and Belgium. All of the Issuer’s directors and executive officers and the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors
are non-residents of the United States and all of the assets of the Issuer and each of the Guarantors and of those persons are
located outside the United States. Although the Issuer will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and
will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws,
you may not be able to effect service of process on such persons or the Issuer or the Guarantors within the United States in
any action, including actions predicated on civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal and state securities laws or other
laws. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer,
the Guarantor or such persons, or to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts, including judgments predicated upon
civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. In addition, we cannot assure you that civil liabilities predicated upon
the Federal securities laws of the United States will be enforceable in Belgium, France or elsewhere.

Additionally, because the Senior Facilities Agreement will be governed by the law of England and Wales, it is likely that
a claim arising therefrom will be brought in an English court, following which enforcement of any judgment rendered
against the Issuer or a Guarantor would need to be sought in an English court.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustees agree that any dispute, controversy or cause
of action against the Issuer, the Guarantors and/or the Trustees arising out of the Indenture or any transaction contemplated
therein, the Notes or other deposited securities, will be referred to and resolved by the courts of New York, as more fully
described in the Indenture.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, the Guarantors or any directors or officers investors will need
to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S.
court judgments outside the United States is described below for France and Belgium, you should consult with your own
advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United
States.

**France**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of France with their registered offices or
principal places of business in France (the “French Entities”). The directors, officers and other executives of the French
Entities are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore, most of the assets
of the French Entities or the French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible
for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States. However, it
may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons or entities, provided that The
Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of
November 15, 1965 is complied with.

Our French counsel has advised us that the United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters.
Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated
solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or
enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before
the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e. non-ex parte) proceedings if such
U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that the following conditions
have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French civil court of
the merits of the foreign judgment):


-----

      - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is clearly
connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the choice of the U.S.
court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter;

      - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and
to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and

      - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions (i.e. those having
a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, and that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with
a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France. Where proceedings are pending before
French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and where these proceedings have the same or similar
subject matter as such U.S. judgment, the courts may stay the exequatur proceedings.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res judicata effect
as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in France after all remedies
have been exhausted. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain
circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and
French Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of documents and information of
an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit
or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action.
Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague
Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French
persons.

Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual
liberties, as most recently modified by law No. 2017-55 of January 20, 2017), as well as the GDPR will likely limit under
certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a
judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context, although the exact extent of these restrictions is yet to be
clarified.

Furthermore, we have been advised by our French counsel that if an original action is brought in France, French courts
may refuse to apply foreign law or a part of foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including
the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to
contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) (as determined on a case-by-case basis by French
courts) or in case of overriding mandatory rules (lois de police). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis
of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign
defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in
France with a French person or in a foreign country with French persons. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code,
a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations
contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant (Article 15). These provisions also apply
in the context of non-contractual obligations. For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a
French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than
French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to
the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and
the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. More specifically, according to this recent case law, a French defendant can no
longer challenge the jurisdiction of a foreign tribunal on the basis of article 15 of the French civil code in circumstances
where the foreign tribunal has otherwise jurisdiction. In addition, French and foreign claimants may respectively waive


-----

their rights respectively to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of
conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

Under Regulation (EU) No. 1215-2012 of the European Parliament and of the EU Council dated December 12, 2012 (“EU
**Regulation 1215-2012”) regarding legal actions falling within the scope of EU Regulation 1215-2012, the privileges**
granted to French nationals pursuant to articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person
domiciled in a EU Member State. However, pursuant to article 6.2 of EU Regulation 1215-2012, the privilege granted by
article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France when bringing legal action against
a defendant domiciled outside of the EU before French courts, irrespective of the claimant’s nationality. The French
Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has held that a jurisdiction clause may only be effective if it complies with the
requirement of foreseeability. This can notably be the case where the jurisdiction clause sets out an objective basis for the
determination of the competent courts. Under this analysis, a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive
jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction, which, by
definition, does not set out an objective basis for the determination of the competent courts to be chosen by the latter party,
would most likely to be considered by French Courts as not complying with the requirement of foreseeability. In particular,
on two occasions in 2012 and 2015, the civil chamber of the French supreme court (Cour de cassation) held that a
contractual provision whereby one party agrees to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the option
to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid. However, the commercial chamber of the French supreme court (Cour
_de cassation) has held the contrary by a decision dated May 11, 2017. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in_
any relevant documents may not be binding over the party having agreed to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or prevent
a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.

**Belgium**

Final and enforceable judgments rendered by foreign courts can be declared enforceable in Belgium (without review of the
foreign judgment on the merits by the Belgian courts) according to the procedure set out in Articles 22 and sq. of the
Belgian Code of International Private Law (Wetboek van Internationaal Privaatrecht) and provided that, pursuant to
Article 24 of the same Code, the following documents are produced in court by the claimant:

      - an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing) fulfilling all conditions required for its authentication
under the applicable foreign law;

      - if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the originating process
has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign law or an equivalent document in
accordance with the applicable foreign law demonstration that the judgment was served or notified to the party
that did not appear; and

      - any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable and has been
notified to the defendant.

However, enforcement can be refused in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Belgian Code of International
Private Law and notably (and, inter alia), if:

      - the consequences of the recognition or enforcement of such foreign decision would be manifestly contrary to
Belgian public policy;

      - the rights of defense were not respected;

      - the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets in such state
without any further connection with the litigation in such state;

      - without prejudice to Article 23.4 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the judgment is not final or
does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the laws of the State where the judgment was rendered
or the applicable federal rules;


-----

      - if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been sought with
the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance with Belgian conflict of
law rules;

      - the decision is in conflict with either a decision rendered in Belgium or a decision previously rendered in another
state and such decision can be recognized in Belgium;

      - the claim was introduced before the courts of such state after a claim, which is still pending and relating to the
same matter and between the same parties, was introduced in a Belgian court;

      - the Belgian courts have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to the claim; or

      - the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in relation to
insolvency proceedings or corporate standing.

Note that the foreign judgment for which enforcement is sought will not be reviewed on the merits of the judgment.

As a general principle, procedural rules are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the court (lex fori). In Belgium the
procedural rules contained in, amongst others, the Belgian Judicial Code and the Belgian Code of Private International
Law will apply when recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered by U.S. courts is sought in Belgium.

In accordance with Articles 23 and 148 of the Belgian Code of Registration Duties, a registration duty at the rate of 3% of
the amount of the judgment is levied in respect of a Belgian decision which authorizes enforcement of a judgment rendered
by a U.S. court, payable by the debtor, if the sum of money which the debtor is ordered to pay by a Belgian court judgment,
or by a foreign court judgment that is either: (i) automatically enforceable and registered in Belgium; or (ii) rendered
enforceable by a Belgian court, exceeds EUR 12,500.

Similar to France, Belgian data protection rules (including the Act of July 30, 2018 on the protection of physical persons
with regard to the processing of personal data), as well as the GDPR, will likely limit under certain circumstances the
possibility of obtaining information in Belgium or from Belgian persons in connection with a judicial or administrative
U.S. action in a discovery context, although the exact extent of these restrictions is yet to be clarified.

**Reconciliation of Laboratoire Eimer Consolidated Financial Statements to CAB Consolidated Financial**

**Statements for the Year Ended December 31, 2020**

_The offering memorandum includes the consolidated financial information of Laboratoire Eimer (“Eimer” or “standalone_
**_company”) and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with French GAAP. The following financial information is an_**
_unaudited reconciliation of CAB's consolidated income statement and balance sheet to Laboratoire Eimer's consolidated_
_financial statements, the purpose of which being to highlight the nature and amount of the differences between the two_
_entities. The following financial Information has been prepared for the year ended December 31, 2020, on the basis set_
_out in the notes below and have been presented for illustrative purposes only._

**Basis for preparation**

The following financial information has been prepared based on the audited consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2020 of CAB and its subsidiaries and of Laboratoire Eimer and its subsidiaries as included therein.
The main differences highlighted below derive (a) from the audited statutory annual financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2020 of Laboratoire Eimer and, (b) from the audited consolidation entries booked for the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements of CAB and Laboratoire Eimer.

**Nature of the principal differences**

The principal differences relate to the natures described below:

      - **Harmonization of the income statements – the line item** _depreciation and amortization is presented net of_
_provision reversals while the financial expenses are presented in the line item_ _cost of debt. The historical_
consolidated financial statements of CAB have been revised to reflect these changes and aligned to the income
statement format used by Laboratoire Eimer.

      - **Contribution of Laboratoire Eimer – On the balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, Eimer contributes mainly**
to the trade receivables (€908.1m), the share premium (€1,465.4m) and the loans and borrowings (€515.3m). On
the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2020, Eimer contributes mainly to the net sales (€18.6m),
the personnel expenses (€5.9m), the other purchases and external expenses (€2.6m), the cost of debt (€24.8m)
and the net non-recurring income loss (€246.1m).

      - **Entries related to the change of parent company – these entries affect the consolidated balance sheet and, in**
particular the line items financial assets, share capital, share premium and reserves. They are intended to reflect
the net equity of the parent company.

      - **Intercompany eliminations – Beyond the contribution of the standalone company, further intercompany**
transactions and balances need to be eliminated between Laboratoire Eimer and CAB and its subsidiaries.

The column "Other adjustments" is a residual amount constructed by difference. It primarily includes minor consolidation
adjustments and intercompany eliminations not captured under "Intercompany eliminations".

**Consolidated EBITDA [a] – [b]** **475.8** **481.1** **5.3** **1%**

The Laboratoire Eimer consolidated income statement differs from the CAB consolidated income statement as follows:

(1) a favourable impact on net sales, operating income and EBITDA of respectively 1%, 0.9% and 1% primarily due
to the operating activities of the standalone company.

(2) an unfavourable impact on Operating income before tax and Net income due to the additional cost of debt and the
additional net non-recurring expenses. Non-recurring expenses in 2020 are related to the creation of Biogroup
Holding (preparing the initial bond offering). These expenses are the accounting consequence of Laboratoire
Eimer buying back historical investors’ instruments, whose value had significantly increased since subscription.
These expenses are largely offset by the associated increase in equity.

(3) a favourable impact on the Consolidated EBITDA, which differs from the Adjusted EBITDA presented elsewhere
in the offering memorandum, driven by the positive contribution of the standalone company.

##### 3. Accounting policies and valuation methods

 3.1. Reporting date

###### All consolidated companies prepare their individual financial statements to 31 December except the two intermediate holding companies Alpine Finances and Alti Finances, which prepare accounts to 30 June, and CBM 25, which prepares its accounts to 31 October (but draw up interim accounts).

##### 3.2. General policies

###### The financial statements for the 3 years ended 31/12/2019, 31/12/2018 and 31/12/2017 have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the French Commercial Code (Articles L 123-12 to L 123-28), ANC Regulations no. 2015-07 of 23/11/2015 and 2016-08 of 2 December 2016, applicable to periods ending on or after 31/12/2016, and the regulations of the Comité de la Règlementation Comptable (CRC).

 The accounting policies have been applied in accordance with the principle of prudence, based on the going concern assumption and on the principle of the separation of accounting periods. 

##### 3.3. Estimates

###### The preparation of financial statements in accordance with Regulation 99-02 requires certain key accounting assumptions to be made. Management must also exercise judgement in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.


-----

###### The areas in which the exercise of judgement or the complexity of the issue is most significant, or in which assumptions and estimates are material, include in particular the measurement of asset impairments and of provisions. 

##### 3.4. Intercompany transactions

###### Adjustments are made for all intra-group transactions. Internal movements and intercompany receivables and payables are eliminated.

 Profits made on intra-group sales of fixed assets are not applicable.

 Dividends paid within the Group are eliminated.

 Eimer has relations with its subsidiaries fully consolidated.

 Transactions with related-parties, excluded fully consolidated subsidiairies, are not material or were entered into on an arm’s length basis.

##### 3.5. Valuation differences and goodwill

###### Valuation differences Valuation differences represent the difference between the valuation of an item in the consolidated balance sheet and the book value of the same item in the balance sheet of the controlled entity. The financial statements include no valuation differences other than consolidation adjustments.

 Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the acquisition cost of shares in consolidated companies and the share of the fair value identified at the acquisition date. Goodwill has been determined by comparing the acquisition price of the shares to the share acquired of the following items:

 • shareholders’ equity at the end of the period preceding the acquisition (less any dividends distributed during the period in which the acquisition took place),
 • the share of net income at the acquisition date,
 • the retirement provisions,
 • deferred tax asset in relation to the retirement provisions,
 • deferred tax assets in relation to temporary differences
 • deferred tax assets in relation to carried-forward tax losses
 • amortisation of business capital and of net technical loss from mergers Where necessary, goodwill has also been reduced by the sum of the following two items:

 - any dividends received during the period in which the acquisition took place, as these are taken into account when determining the price of the acquired shares; - in the event of new goodwill arising following an increase to an existing holding, the amount of any goodwill, net of amortisation, at the end of the previous period.

 Intra-group gains on sales of business capital are eliminated.


-----

###### Insofar as it is not composed of identifiable assets, business capital recognised in the balance sheets of Group companies can be equated with goodwill, as intangible with indefinite useful life. It is therefore adjusted as follows in the consolidated financial statements:

 • disclosure within intangible assets,
 • impairment test performed in the same way as for goodwill.

 Amortisation and impairment Until 31/12/2015, goodwill was amortised on a straight-line basis over a 20-year period, starting from the first day of the month if the acquisition took place on or before the 15th day of the month or from the first day of the following month if the acquisition took place after the 15th day of the month. Where existing on the acquisition date, business capital and net technical loss from mergers were amortised:
 • from the date on which control was acquired, if existing on that date, or

          - from the date on their initial recognition, if recognised subsequent to the acquisition of control.

###### In line with ANC Regulation no. 2015-07 on the amortisation and impairment of goodwill in consolidated financial statements, mandatory for periods starting on or after 1 January 2016, goodwill ceased to be amortised from that period onwards.

 The company carries out an impairment test on each consolidated legal entity, based on a multiple of twelve times EBITDA in 2019, eleven times EBITDA in 2018 and ten times EBITDA in 2017. This test is only applied starting from the second period in which the subsidiary belongs to the Group. Performance of this impairment test has not given rise to the recognition of a provision.

##### 3.6. Cash flows statement

###### In the consolidated cash flows statement:

 • cash flows from operations comprise: - the total operating profit of the consolidated companies, adjusted for net non-recurring income or expenses, the amount of corporation tax paid, and net additions to (or reversals of) depreciation, amortisation and provisions; - movements in working capital, presented inclusive of the effect of changes in the scope of consolidation.

 • cash flows from investing activities comprise: - purchases of fixed assets, - costs of acquisitions of equity interests, corrected for acquisition-related costs net of deferred tax and less the opening cash of the companies concerned.

 • cash flows from financing activities comprise the Group’s financing transactions.

 • net cash and related instruments are defined as the sum of “Cash” and “Marketable securities” as disclosed in the balance sheet, less “Amounts due to banks”.

##### 3.7. Deferred taxation

###### Deferred taxes arise primarily from temporary differences between the accounting profit and taxable profit (which are not material), consolidation adjustments, and carried-forward tax-losses.


-----

###### The Group applies the liability method and recognises deferred tax wherever the value of an asset or liability for tax purposes is different from its value for accounting purposes.

 The effects of changes in tax rates are recognised in profit or loss for the period during which the change is enshrined in law.

 Deferred tax assets arising from carried-forward tax losses are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be offset against future profits within a reasonable timeframe.

 The possibility of recognising a tax asset in the consolidated financial statements is thus limited by the recommendations issued in Regulation 99-02.

 At 31 December 2019, as at 31 December 2018 and at 31 December 2017, no deferred tax assets were recognised in respect of tax losses.

##### 3.8. Leasing

###### Material fixed asset acquisitions made via finance leases are recognised as assets at their original cost and depreciated in the same manner as equivalent types of property, plant and equipment (in application of Regulations CRC 2002-10 and 2004-06). The debt arising from acquisitions of this type is recognised as a liability.

##### 3.9. Research and development costs

###### Costs of this type are recorded as operating expenses.

##### 3.10. Other intangible assets

###### These comprise:
 • Software and IT licences: these items are amortised over a period of 1 to 5 years.
 • For goodwill, business capital, and net technical loss from mergers, refer to section 3.5 above.

##### 3.11. Property, plant and equipment

###### Property, plant and equipment are valued at cost (purchase price plus ancillary costs) excluding financing costs.

 They are recognised at the amounts appearing in the individual financial statements of the consolidated companies.

 Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the likely useful lives of the assets in question. It is calculated on the historic cost of the assets. Assets are subjected to accelerated depreciation if the useful life becomes shorter than the period originally anticipated.

 The estimated useful lives of significant items of property, plant and equipment are as follows :

 Inamovible fittings 10 years Fixtures and fittings 10 years Equipment and tooling 5 years Furniture, Office and IT equipment 3-5 years

##### 3.12. Financial assets


-----

###### This item primarily comprises financial advances on share purchases.

 If required, impairments are recognised in order to reduce the net book value of financial assets to their value in use.

##### 3.13. Inventories

###### The cost of inventories is made up of the purchase price plus any ancillary costs.

 Inventories are valued in accordance with the first-in, first-out method.

 Impairments are recognised on inventories where the value as determined above differs from the current price or realisable value.

##### 3.14. Trade receivables

###### Accounts receivable are recognised at their nominal value, less any impairments required to reduce them to their actual current value. Impairments are recognised where there is a risk of non- collection due to a delay in payment or a dispute regarding the goods or services supplied.

##### 3.15. Issuance costs of borrowings

###### The issuance costs of borrowings are recognised as deferred charges and amortised over the term of the loan . 

##### 3.16. Marketable securities

###### Marketable securities are valued at their historical cost. A valuation test is performed on the realisable value of the marketable securities and an impairment provision is established where required.

##### 3.17. Provisions for risks and charges

###### These comprise:

 • Provisions for litigation
 • Retirement provisions
 • Negative goodwill

 Management has examined all of the disputes in which the Group was involved at the year-end, and, after taking external advice, the provisions have been recognised where necessary to cover the estimated risks.

 No specific adjustments are made in the consolidated financial statements in relation to provisions for risks and charges, other than the recognition of the retirement provisions where no such provision has been recognised in a company’s individual financial statements. In accordance with article 212-3 of CRC Regulation 00-06, provisions for risks and charges represent liabilities which represent probable or certain obligations at the year-end but whose payment date or amount has not been precisely ascertained.

##### 3.18. Pension and similar commitments

###### Pension commitments for the Group’s companies have been calculated in accordance with the “retrospective” method.


-----

###### Pension commitments are measured using the projected unit credit method for all employees, in
proportion to length of service and based on final salary and were calculated on the basis of the
###### following assumptions:

Retirement age 65 years 65 years 65 years
Social security rate 50% 50% 50%

###### Variation are booked against P&L.

##### 3.19. Income tax

 Deferred tax is calculated separately for each company, taking account of consolidation adjustments and temporary differences.

##### 3.20. Segment information

###### The Group’s operating segments used in reported financial information have been identified on the basis of the internal reports used by management to allocate resources to the segments and assess their performance, and were defined according to national localisation.

##### 4. Scope and methods of consolidation

 4.1. Structure of the Group as at 31/12/2019

% Voting rights % Financial rights

###### The companies within the scope of consolidation and the consolidation methods used are as follows:

 • companies under exclusive control (fully consolidated): CAB, Victair, Biomer, Santé Labo, BC LAB, Biolam, Unibio, Astralab, 2A2B, Bioesterel, Bio Azur, Biolittoral, BPO-Bioépine, Biosynergie, Val de Meuse, Biogroup, Biomag, Unilians, Laboschambéry, Mirialis, Alti Finances, Alpine Finances, SCI Mirhelios, SCI Unilians, GIE Biopartenaires, CBM 25, SPFPL M. Widmer.

          - all entities over which the Group exercises a significant or greater influence are consolidated.

###### Shareholdings in non-consolidated subsidiaries totalled €1,771 thousand. These are companies in which the group has no significant influence, are held on a temporary basis, or whose activity is unconnected with that of the Group.

 CBM 25 and SPFPL M. Widmer have been fully consolidated, notwithstanding an ongoing dispute with a third party who has contested the validity of SPFPL M. Widmer’s acquisition of shares in CBM 25. As a result of the dispute, the CBM 25 shares were placed in sequestration with effect from 6 August 2019 until judgment was rendered by the court of first instance on 19 December 2019, whereby the Regional Court of Besançon declared the sale void and ordered provisional enforcement. The company appealed the decision on substantive grounds and applied to the First President of the Court for a suspension of the provisional enforcement. On the FY2019 closing date the decision had not been enforced, the shares thus remained in the ownership of the Group as of 31.12.2019.

###### Until 31/12/2015, goodwill was amortised over a 20-year period.  Since 2016, an annual impairment test has been conducted. The EBITDA multiple used to carry out this test at 31 December 2019 was 12 (2018: 11), (2017:10) this figure being based on the features of recent transactions carried out by the Group. No impairment charges on goodwill were required in the 2019 financial year. This is also the case for 2018 and 2017.  As of 31.12.2019 an impairment charge of M€ 8,1 was recognised during the period on the intangible assets with indefinite useful life at Eimer level. No other significant impairment charge were booked against intangible assets in FY 2018 and 2017 Main impacts from acquisitions over the 3 periods are presented in the section “significant events”, please refer to that section for detailed information over Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life.

 Contingent liabilities as of 31 December 2019:

 • On 24/10/2018, Bio Azur was sued, jointly with its shareholders who are natural persons, by the biologist Mr Nicolas Piron for the sum of €13.6 million on grounds of non-performance of a transfer of shares between him and Ms Pascale Chevrot. This dispute is subject to a guarantee agreement connected to the acquisition of the holding in Bio Azur by LBM Bioesterel. As a result, the financial and legal consequences of this dispute will be borne by the individual shareholders, to the exclusion of any recourse to the companies Bio Azur and Bioesterel

 • Bioesterel has undergone a tax audit in relation to the 2013 and 2014 periods. The notified adjustments of €3 million, which are disputed in their entirety, concern the reclassification of the remuneration of biologists deemed to be independent workers as remuneration subject to the tax on salaries and to all other levies assessed on the basis of salary. All of the claims made by the tax authority are being contested before the Administrative Court; as agreed with the specialist lawyers, no provision has been established. To guarantee the payment of the amounts claimed, LBM Bioesterel has obtained a directly enforceable guarantee from Crédit Agricole. The risk is also covered by the seller’s warranty.

 • On 4 April 2018, BPO-Bioépine was sued in the Regional Court by Mr Stéphane Madoux and the companies MS Bio and MS INV with a view to obtaining a formal finding that the transfer of all the assets of the medical biology laboratory located at Avenue Denfert Rochereau, Paris

###### and operated by BPO-Bioépine was complete. The suit requested that BPO-Bioépine be ordered to pay contractual penalties of €1 million plus €3 million in damages. A payment of €0.5 million was expensed in 2017. There remains a possible risk that BPO-Bioépine may be ordered to pay the whole of the amounts claimed. No provision has been recognised in relation to this risk.

##### 7.10. Net income per share

###### In its consolidated financial statements, Biogroup presents basic net income per share and diluted net per share, calculated based on net income to the Group. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to owners of the parent for the year by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The average number of shares outstanding during the year is the number of shares outstanding at the beginning of the year adjusted by the number of shares issued or cancelled during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to owners of the parent for the year by the weighted average number of outstanding shares, plus potentially dilutive shares to be created. This concerns convertible bonds and redeemable preferred shares. For the 3 periods, only dilutive instruments are taken into account. Convertible bonds are qualified anti-dilutive over the 3 periods and are not taken into account, and redeemable bonds are qualified anti-dilutive for 2018 and 2017 and taken into account in 2019.

 8.3. Subsequent events affecting the structure of the Group

##### As of 31.12.2019

###### Impact of COVID-19 


-----

###### A major event of early 2020 has been the COVID-19 public health crisis. However, as this subsequent event is unconnected to any situation already existing at 31 December 2019, we have not adjusted our financial statements for the year ended on that date.

 Owing to the full lockdown measures put in place, the Group has noted a substantial downturn in business since the lockdown began, which is linked to the reduced number of prescriptions being issued by doctors. Nevertheless, the gradual increase in tests carried out in connection with the fight against COVID-19 is making up for the regular activity of our sites.

 As of the closing date of 2019 of the consolidated accounts, the Group is not in a position to quantify the impact of the epidemic on results. However, the Group has access to significant liquid funds, both via its available cash and due to the available revolving credit facilities (as of the closing date of 2019 of the consolidated accounts). We have also availed ourselves of the options to delay payment of certain tax and social security charges, and therefore consider that our ability to continue as a going concern is not in question.

 Evolution of the Group since 31.12.2019 until closing of accounts in 2020

 In early March 2020, the Group acquired majority interests in three professional partnerships based in western France, Réseau Bio, Sèvres Biologie and Biomélys, for €27,658 thousand. This acquisition was financed from available cash and by a drawdown of the revolving credit facility.

##### As of 31.12.2018

In early 2019, the group continued to grow, acquiring a stake in the companies Bioazur, Biomag and Unilians.

##### As of 31.12.2017

###### In early 2018, the group acquired a stake in the company Bio Paris Ouest and continues its desire for external growth.

 This equity investment was carried out by a contribution of shares in the company Biolam LCD and a capital increase followed by a capital reduction.

 In addition, various operations to increase or reduce capital were carried out (the company Biolam LCD carried out an increase reserved for CAB; the company Biomer carried out a capital reduction); the company Eimer carried out a capital reduction and issued bonds with attached
warrants for the amount of M€ 95.

##### 8.4. Statutory auditors’ fees

###### As of 31.12.2019 statutory auditors’ fees for all the companies in the consolidated group totalled €175,500 in relation to audit services and €147,500 for other services.  As of 31.12.2018 statutory auditors’ fees for all the companies in the consolidated group totalled €395,058 in relation to audit services and €87,650 for other services.  As of 31.12.2017 statutory auditors’ fees for all the companies in the consolidated group totalled €285,670 in relation to audit services and €31,369 for other services.
