949,Offerings 2020.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"We believe that the financial statements included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum have been prepared in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (‘‘GAAP’’), and the regulations published by the SEC, and are consistent with current practice with the exception of the presentation of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings, Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, successbased capital expenditures, maintenance capital expenditures, adjusted unlevered free cash flow and levered free cash flow, and ratio data and pro forma data utilizing such non-GAAP financial measures, as well as the omission of certain financial information regarding the guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries and certain audited financial statements required by Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X. These non-GAAP financial measures, as presented in this offering memorandum, are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, and are not presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful for potential purchasers of the notes in assessing our operating performance and our ability to meet our debt service requirements. In particular, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted unlevered free cash flow and levered free cash flow are measures commonly used by financial analysts in evaluating a company’s performance and/or ability to service and/or incur indebtedness. Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum is consistent with Zayo’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in its reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. However, the non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. In addition, the items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures are significant in assessing our operating results and liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings do not reflect capital expenditures, or future requirements for capital and major maintenance expenditures or contractual commitments; - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings and adjusted unlevered free cash flow do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings and adjusted unlevered free cash flow do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our debt; - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings and adjusted unlevered free cash flow do not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes; - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings and adjusted unlevered free cash flow do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - success-based capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures, in each case, do not reflect all of the capital expenditures incurred by us in the operation of our business; and - levered free cash flow does not reflect principal payments on our debt, finance lease obligations, any dividend payments or the cost of acquisitions. v ----- In addition, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings are adjusted to reflect the estimated annual impact of cost savings we expect to ultimately realize, as well as estimated results from entities we have acquired (prior to the date of acquisition). These adjustments are presented because they will be permitted under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes, but you should not view these adjustments as a projection of results in any period. These adjustments reflect the impact of savings but do not reflect any cash costs we will incur to realize these savings. Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue and Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings for the three months ended December 31, 2019 also include the run-rate impact (in the case of Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings, taking into account an assumed margin as reasonably estimated by the Company) for the periods presented of the MRR attributable to contracts signed during or after such period, as if such MRR had been received by the Company as of the first day of such period, net of MRR attributable to contracts that were cancelled or terminated or for which the Company has received notice of cancellation or termination. Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings do not reflect the historical revenue, Adjusted EBITDA or Further Adjusted EBITDA for such period and you should not view such non-GAAP financial measures to be projections of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA or Further Adjusted EBITDA in any future period. Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures and the related ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in business growth or to reduce indebtedness. In calculating these non-GAAP financial measures, we make certain adjustments that are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to have been inaccurate. In addition, in evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. For more information, see the financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. The SEC has adopted rules that regulate the use of non-GAAP financial measures. These rules require, among other things: - a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP; and - a statement disclosing the purposes for which the issuer’s management uses the non-GAAP financial measure. The rules prohibit, among other things: - exclusion of charges or liabilities that require cash settlement or would have required cash settlement absent an ability to settle in another manner, from non-GAAP liquidity measures; - adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably likely to recur; and - presentation of non-GAAP financial measures on the face of the GAAP financial statements (or notes thereto) or any pro forma financial information. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this offering memorandum may not comply with these rules.

949,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Business,9.1.1,,"We are a leading provider of communications and bandwidth infrastructure in the United States, with an extensive breadth of network in Canada and Europe. We supply mission-critical high-bandwidth infrastructure for connectivity to customers whose businesses require rapidly increasing bandwidth, driven by the growth of cloud-based computing, video, mobile and social media applications, machine-to-machine connectivity and other bandwidth-intensive applications. Our key products include leased dark fiber, fiber to cellular towers and small cell sites, dedicated Wavelength (as defined below) connections, Ethernet, IP connectivity, data center colocation, cloud offerings and other high-bandwidth offerings. We are focused primarily on providing bandwidth infrastructure solutions to our customers through our owned and secure network (‘‘on-net’’), comprised of dense metro, regional and long-haul fiber network sections, and through our interconnect-oriented data center facilities. We are a leader across various bandwidth infrastructure product markets, including dark fiber, mobile infrastructure capabilities and fiber backhaul for towers and data centers. Our network footprint includes both large (e.g., New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Paris and London) and smaller (e.g., Allentown, Pennsylvania, Fargo, North Dakota and Spokane, Washington) metro geographies, the extended suburban regions of many cities and the large rural, national and international links that connect our metro network sections. Due to the amount of time, permitting and capital investment that would be required, we believe it would be difficult for our competitors to replicate the geographic reach and density of our network assets. As of December 31, 2019, our fiber network spanned 133,000 route miles and 13.1 million fiber miles (representing an average of 98.5 fibers per route and including approximately 8.7 million metro fiber miles and approximately 4.4 million long-haul network fiber miles), served 400 geographic markets in the United States, Canada and Europe and connected to approximately 35,000 buildings, including 1,200 data centers. Approximately 88% of our fiber miles are owned, with the remaining approximately 12% under long-term leases. Our network-neutral colocation and interconnection offerings utilize our own data centers located within major carrier hotels and other strategic buildings in 44 locations throughout the United States, Canada and Europe, and we operated approximately 750,000 square feet of billable colocation space as of December 31, 2019. We have designed our network with additional capacity so that increasing bandwidth capacity can be deployed economically and efficiently, allowing us to provide scalable and tailored on-net bandwidth infrastructure solutions to our customers as demand for high-bandwidth infrastructure increases. In addition, through the process of Wavelength-division multiplexing (‘‘Wavelengths’’), many of our core network technologies provide capacity that allows us to continue adding dedicated channels (or ‘‘lanes’’) of light that accommodate telecommunications traffic without consuming additional fiber. We believe we have a distinct competitive advantage as large carriers are reluctant to offer dark fiber infrastructure that could cannibalize their legacy lit bandwidth services, while incumbent local exchange 1 ----- carriers (‘‘ILECs’’) and cable companies are generally focused on growing their mobile and consumer broadband businesses, respectively. In addition, to date, our only other competitor with a national footprint has not pursued extensive dark fiber offerings. Furthermore, unlike Zayo, regional fiber carriers are focused on servicing enterprises but have limited ability to offer multi-geography connectivity solutions. Our customer base includes the largest and most sophisticated users of bandwidth infrastructure offerings, such as wireless service providers; telecommunications service providers; financial services companies; social networking, media and web content companies; education, research and healthcare institutions; and governmental agencies. We believe we are a leading fiber infrastructure partner for wireless carriers globally and approximately 77% of our revenue is derived from our bandwidth infrastructure offerings. We generally have long-term relationships with our customers due to the mission-critical nature of our solutions, replacement of which can be costly and disruptive, as well as our high level of customer satisfaction. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the average contract length for our Zayo Networks segment was approximately 4.3 years (or 9 years for contracts for fiber solutions). The average recurring revenue period for each dollar of revenue is approximately 7 years. In addition, approximately 80% of our customers use more than one of our products to support their respective networks. Our revenues are also highly diversified with respect to our customer base. As of December 31, 2019, we had more than 7,500 customers, and for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, our top ten customers and our top 200 customers accounted for only approximately 27% and 60% of our revenues, respectively. The following chart illustrates percentage of revenue derived from our customers for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, by industry:",N/A,as_expected,2020,390

Our services and offerings are typically provided in exchange for a fixed monthly recurring fee under multi-year contracts, providing us with high revenue visibility. For the three months ended December 31, 2019, approximately 98% of our revenue was recurring in nature (after adjusting for a single customer bankruptcy event). Our capital expenditure investments are primarily successbased, meaning that before we commit resources to expand our network, we have one or more signed customer contracts that will provide us with an attractive return on the required capital investment. After committing capital to connect additional customer sites, our goal is to sell additional high-bandwidth connectivity on these new routes at a relatively low incremental cost to further enhance the return from our asset base. In addition, because physical fiber and conduits typically have a long 2 ----- lifetime and have ample expansion capabilities, they require minimal maintenance resulting in low maintenance capital expenditure requirements. For the quarter ended December 31, 2019, we generated revenue of $653.7 million and net income of $61.4 million. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, for the three months ended December 31, 2019, our net loss, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings would have been $(16.7) million, $340.8 million and $366.6 million, respectively.

949,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Bandwidth Infrastructure Industry,9.3.1,Industry History,"Our industry has changed substantially over the years. The first phase of the bandwidth infrastructure industry occurred with the advent of the internet and the ensuing dot com era in the late 1990s. This led to the first major wave of fiber network deployments as a number of companies of varying backgrounds and profiles invested billions of dollars in fiber network construction throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. These fiber network developers included companies with national and international plans (e.g., Level 3 Communications, Qwest Communications, Williams Communications) and others with more regional plans (e.g., 360networks, Progress Telecom, OnFiber). Following these network builds, many fiber companies struggled in the early 2000s due to the lack of sufficient demand for their high-bandwidth offerings. Bandwidth demand during this timeframe was limited by the fact that many bandwidth-intensive applications (e.g., streaming video, cloud, mobile broadband, big data analytics, etc.) were either not yet contemplated or still very early in their life cycle. Instead, the majority of traffic at the time consisted of low-bandwidth offerings such as voice and dial-up modem connections. In addition, the similarity of the fiber routes deployed resulted in significant overcapacity and associated pricing pressure, leaving both a ‘‘last mile’’ gap and heavy competition and overcapacity along these routes. These two primary factors combined to significantly limit the fiber network providers’ operating cash flows, resulting in the majority of these companies transitioning their business models, consolidating and/or seeking bankruptcy protection. In the following years, a substantial expansion in computing power and bandwidth-intensive applications drove meaningful bandwidth traffic growth. This growth highlighted the need to address the ‘‘last mile’’ gap by bringing bandwidth capacity directly to both the consumer and business end user. The capacity and performance of the consumer ‘‘last mile’’ connection was primarily addressed by the expansion of cable networks and through mobile network development by wireless carriers (supported by cellular tower operators). The growing bandwidth demand of business end users was addressed by a number of focused fiber developers constructing new networks to directly connect to data centers, cellular towers, government facilities, schools, hospitals and other locations with high-bandwidth needs. These fiber network companies were generally local or regional in nature and were most often either survivors of the initial fiber development wave, subsidiaries of a utility parent, or owned by 3 ----- entrepreneurs. Companies also focused on financial discipline following the large speculative capital deployments of the dot com era.",N/A,as_expected,2020,390
949,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Bandwidth Infrastructure Industry,9.3.2,The Industry Today,"The acceleration in the development of bandwidth-intensive components and applications has resulted in a significant need to further fill in the ‘‘last mile’’ gap, leading to substantial capital investments in fiber networks by bandwidth infrastructure providers. Bandwidth infrastructure solutions support customer applications such as high-definition television broadcasting and video; online streaming video; cloud applications replacing in-house enterprise software platforms and explosive mobile data consumption. Companies whose services require large amounts of bandwidth and enterprises that consume large amounts of bandwidth are struggling to adapt to this rapidly evolving landscape and the bandwidth infrastructure industry is growing in economic importance as it addresses this critical need. In addition, due to economies of scale, there has been significant consolidation in the bandwidth infrastructure industry, particularly in the United States. We believe this consolidation trend will continue in the United States and is beginning in Europe and Canada. Combined with the barriers to new entrants, we foresee continuing consolidation resulting in a decreasing number of bandwidth infrastructure providers, against a backdrop of continued strong demand for their solutions.",N/A,as_expected,2020,390
949,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Bandwidth Infrastructure Industry,9.3.3,Industry Participants,"We categorize the participants in today’s communications industry as follows: - Providers of Infrastructure are companies that own and operate infrastructure assets that are used to market and deliver infrastructure offerings. We further categorize providers of infrastructure as follows: - Bandwidth Infrastructure Providers are owners of bandwidth infrastructure assets comprised of fiber networks and interconnect-oriented colocation facilities. Bandwidth infrastructure offerings include dark fiber, lit fiber (Wavelengths, Ethernet, IP, and SONET) and colocation and interconnection offerings for the purpose of accommodating customers’ mission-critical traffic including data, voice, and video. - Data Center Providers are owners of data center facilities that include raised floor, power and cooling infrastructure. These facilities house and support customer networking and computing equipment for carrier networks, enterprise cloud platforms, content distribution networks, and other mission-critical applications. - Cellular Tower Providers are owners of cellular towers, the physical infrastructure upon which customer antennas and associated components are co-located for the wireless carrier industry. - Users of Infrastructure are purchasers of infrastructure offerings to either provide value-added services to their customers or for their own private network requirements. We further categorize users of infrastructure as follows: - Communications Service Providers are companies that use infrastructure to package, market, and sell value-added communications services such as voice, internet, data, video, wireless and hosting solutions. Examples of communications service providers include wireless service providers, ILECs, competitive local exchange carriers and internet service providers. - End users are public sector entities and private enterprises that use infrastructure for their own internal networks. End users may also address their needs by purchasing value-added services from communications service providers. 4 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,390
949,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Bandwidth Infrastructure Industry,9.3.4,Our Market Opportunity,"We believe there will be sustained increase in demand for bandwidth infrastructure, driven by the following trends: - Proliferation of data-intensive activities. The proliferation of smart devices and mobile broadband, real-time streaming video, social networks, online gaming, machine-to-machine connectivity, big data analytics and cloud computing is expected to continue to drive data consumption and, in turn, the need for bandwidth infrastructure. Cisco estimates that mobile data traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate (‘‘CAGR’’) of 46% from 2017 to 2022 and that IP traffic will grow at a CAGR of 26% from 2017 to 2022. - Digital transformation driving B2B connectivity. End users such as private enterprises (e.g., media/ content providers, financial institutions and hospital systems) and public sector entities (e.g., governmental agencies and school districts) are increasingly focused on digital transformation. As digital solutions continue to grow in both volume and criticality, we believe end users will increasingly choose to directly procure dark fiber access instead of leasing lit fiber from conventional carriers, in order to gain more security, control and scale in their internal network operations. For example, many large school districts now provide e-education solutions, resulting in an increase in direct procurement of dark fiber access from bandwidth infrastructure providers by these school districts. - Increased demand for mobile infrastructure backhaul. The introduction of 5G mobile and the continuing rise of the Internet of Things (‘‘IoT’’) is expected to increase carriers’ coverage and densification requirements, resulting in significantly increased demand for bandwidth infrastructure, specifically for fiber backhaul for existing 4G sites and upgrades for such sites to 5G. According to IDC and Gartner, the number of 5G mobile and IoT subscribers is expected to increase from zero in 2017 to 224 million in 2023. The CTIA anticipates that in the U.S., carrier deployment of small cells required to densify 4G networks and provide the bedrock for 5G networks will increase from 86,000 to 800,000 by 2026. - Increased adoption of hosting and cloud services. Businesses are increasingly focused on transforming and modernizing their traditional data center infrastructure in order to optimize their IT operations. This has resulted in increased adoption of cloud solutions (both private and public), as compared to traditional on-premise IT infrastructure or in-house legacy systems that require significant costs to manage and maintain. According to 451 Research, private cloud adoption by enterprises is expected to increase from 27% in 2019 to 34% in 2021, while public cloud adoption is expected to increase from 22% in 2019 to 39% in 2021. The increase in cloud adoption is expected to drive demand for data center connectivity, fueling an increase in the overall U.S. data center total addressable market from $46 billion in 2017 to $120 billion in 2024, representing a CAGR of 15%. As these dynamics play out across various industries, we believe the number of end users directly seeking access to bandwidth infrastructure, in particular dark fiber, will continue to grow. We believe that fiber currently delivers the highest bandwidth for real-time applications, provides symmetric bandwidths for upload and download, is low latency and is not dependent on distance, providing end users with the best bandwidth solution in terms of speed, coverage, reliability and latency. We believe there is no technological substitute for fiber available today or in the near term.

949,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.14,Our Competitive Strengths,9.14.1,,"We believe the following are among our core competitive strengths and enable us to differentiate ourselves in the markets where we operate: - Leader in Large and Growing Market with Attractive Fundamentals. Zayo is a leading bandwidth infrastructure provider, operating in an attractive industry with strong fundamentals. We are a leader in major top-tier markets, ranking among the top 5 competitive fiber providers in 24 of the top 30 metropolitan statistical areas. Due to the proliferation of data-driven activities, the focus on digital transformation and increased demand for both tower and data center connectivity, we believe that the demand for bandwidth infrastructure and, in particular, dark fiber, will continue to grow. According to Credence Research, the total addressable market for dark fiber network is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10% from $4.8 billion in 2017 to $11.6 billion in 2026. As of December 31, 2019, 65% of our backlog (which we refer to as service activation pipeline) was composed of long-term dark fiber services. We believe our international and national scale, combined with our historical investments in our fiber network, will allow us to continue to expand our leadership position. - Extensive and Dense Bandwidth Infrastructure Network. We have an extensive network footprint that includes both large and smaller metro geographies, the extended suburban regions of many cities and the large rural, national and international links that connect our metro network sections. As of December 31, 2019, our fiber network spanned 133,000 route miles and 13.1 million fiber miles (representing approximately 400 geographic markets in the United States. Canada and Europe) and connected to approximately 35,000 buildings. Due to the amount of time, permitting and capital investment that would be required, we believe it would be difficult for our competitors to replicate the geographic reach and network density of our network assets. This provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage as a mission-critical infrastructure supplier to the largest users of bandwidth across the United States. - Significant Revenue Visibility from High Recurring Revenue Stream Supported by Robust Backlog. Our high recurring revenue stream, combined with the long-term nature of our customer relationships, provides us with significant revenue visibility. For the three months ended December 31, 2019, approximately 98% of our revenue was recurring in nature (after adjusting for a single customer bankruptcy event) and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our average contract length for our Zayo Networks segment was approximately 4.3 years (or 9 years for contracts for fiber solutions), with approximately 80% of our customers utilizing more than one of our products to support their respective networks. In addition, the average recurring revenue period for each dollar of revenue is approximately 7 years. Our high revenue visibility is further supported by our robust backlog. The revenues derived from our fiber business have increased at a CAGR of 22% from approximately $289 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 to approximately $1 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, driven by increasing demand for fiber as well as growth in fiber revenue through acquisitions. As of December 31, 2019, we had $20 million of MAR and MRR in our service activation pipeline, of which 96.4% is attributable to offerings made through our Zayo Networks segment. We have consistently grown our organic revenue, with gross installed revenue exceeding churn processed for our Zayo Networks and zColo segments in every quarter since March 2010. - Highly Diversified Revenue Streams. Our revenue base is diversified across geographies, industries and customers, which reduces our exposure to industry changes and sector volatility and our reliance on any individual client relationship. We operate in more than 400 geographic markets and, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, approximately 20% of our revenue was derived from our international operations. Our customer base is spread across five distinct 8 ----- industries, with our carrier customers (who are blue chip customers with strong credit profiles) accounting for 46% of our revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, and no other industry accounting for more than 16% of our revenues for the same period. As of December 31, 2019, we had more than 7,500 customers and for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, no customer represented more than 8.4% of our total revenue and our top 200 customers accounted for only 60% of our revenues. - Strong Cash Flow Generation and Low Capital Expenditure Requirements. We have consistently generated strong free cash flows due to our highly diversified and recurring revenue streams, low maintenance capital expenditure requirements and strong margins. In addition, our capital expenditure investments are primarily success-based and committed at high returns. On an aggregate basis and excluding Allstream, we achieved less than two year payback periods on our capital expenditures in 11 out of the last 13 fiscal quarters. For the six months ended December 31, 2019, we had Adjusted EBITDA margins of 55.9% and our maintenance capital expenditures constituted only 1.9% of revenues for the same period. - Experienced Management Team Backed by New Equity Owners. Our management team has substantial industry experience in managing and designing fiber network and network-neutral colocation and interconnection facilities and in selling and marketing bandwidth infrastructure. In addition, our management team has significant experience in acquiring and integrating bandwidth infrastructure and assets. We believe that the vision and network of relationships brought by the Investor Group, led by Digital Colony Partners and EQT Infrastructure, as executed by our experienced management team, will allow us to continue our successful growth.",N/A,as_expected,2020,390
949,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.15,Our Business Strategy,9.15.1,,"We intend to capitalize on our strengths to extend our market leadership by executing on the following strategies: - Continued Focus on Our Customers’ High Bandwidth Infrastructure Needs. The majority of our customers require more than 10G of bandwidth and many of our customers require multiple terabytes of bandwidth. The MRR attributable to our top ten customers has increased at a CAGR of 10% from approximately $26 million as of June 30, 2013 to approximately $48 million as of December 31, 2019. We expect our customers’ bandwidth needs will continue to grow, propelled by the continued proliferation of data-driven activities, the focus on digital transformation and increased demand for both tower and data center connectivity. We will continue to focus on providing, and increasing bookings for, our high-bandwidth infrastructure solutions, which we believe are essential to enabling our customers to meet and address these trends. - Leverage Our Existing Dense and Extensive Network. Having already made significant capital investments in building out our dense and extensive fiber network, we plan on leveraging our investments by expanding and targeting our sales efforts to solutions that utilize our existing network and data centers. We estimate that we have a substantial on-net and near-net market opportunity based on our existing and in-construction U.S. access network. We believe we will be able to sell additional high-bandwidth connectivity at low incremental costs, which we believe positions us to achieve high incremental margins and attractive returns on our invested capital and realize significant levered free cash flow. - Expand Our Infrastructure Assets for Long-Term Growth. Our ability to rapidly add network capacity to meet the growing requirements of our customers is an important component of our value proposition. We have designed our network with additional capacity so that increasing bandwidth capacity can be deployed economically and efficiently, and we will continue to seek opportunities to expand our network reach, both organically and through selective and opportunistic acquisitions, where supporting customer contracts provide an attractive return on our investment. 9 ----- - Enhance Product and Solutions Portfolio by Leveraging Existing Assets. We plan to continue to commit capital to new lines of infrastructure businesses that leverage our existing assets. For example, we are expanding into small cell infrastructure solutions provided to wireless services providers, which involves the provision of dark fiber and related offerings from small cell locations to a mobile switching center. We believe that selective expansion of our product and solutions portfolio will drive increased margins and extend our market leadership. - Continue to Invest in Our Go-to Market Engine and Salesforce. We have made significant investments in our sales channel and expect to continue to build out our local sales teams. We have reorganized our salesforce into customer verticals supported by local business development resources to enable them to bolster bookings, increase our wallet share of existing customers and penetrate a wider cross-section of businesses. Our salesforces will continue to focus on strengthening customer relationships to increase high-margin bookings and reduce churn.",N/A,as_expected,2020,390

In connection with the Tender Offers, Merger Sub also solicited consents (the ‘‘Consent Solicitations’’) of holders of the Existing Notes to amend the indentures governing the Existing Notes (collectively, the ‘‘Existing Indentures’’) to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants relating to Zayo Group, LLC and Zayo Capital, Inc. and their restricted subsidiaries, certain reporting obligations, certain events of default and related provisions in the applicable Existing Indenture, including the obligation to conduct a change of control offer to purchase all outstanding Existing Notes of the applicable series in accordance with the applicable Existing Indenture at a purchase price of 101.0% of the aggregate principal amount thereof in connection with the Merger (the ‘‘Proposed Amendments’’). The Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations are being conducted upon the terms and subject to the conditions in the related offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement and this offering memorandum is not an offer to purchase or a solicitation of any consent with respect to any of the Existing Notes. Merger Sub offered, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Tender Offer, to pay a total consideration of (1) $1,020.00 (including a $30.00 early tender payment) for each $1,000 principal amount of Existing 2023 Notes, (2) $1,020.00 (including a $30.00 early tender payment) for each $1,000 principal amount of Existing 2025 Notes and (3) $1,020.00 (including a $30.00 early tender payment) for each $1,000 principal amount of Existing 2027 Notes, in each case validly tendered in the applicable Tender Offer on or prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 31, 2020 (the ‘‘Early Tender Deadline’’). The early tender payment will not be paid for any Existing Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline. The final expiration date for the Tender Offers is February 14, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated by Merger Sub. We expect to extend the expiration date from time to time such that the consummation of the Tender Offers will occur substantially concurrently with the closing of the Merger. As of January 31, 2020, holders of $1,279,830,000 aggregate principal amount of Existing 2023 Notes, $862,783,000 aggregate principal amount of Existing 2025 Notes and $1,615,115,000 aggregate principal amount of Existing 2027 Notes had validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) their Existing Notes and validly consented to the Proposed Amendments. On January 31, 2020, Zayo and the applicable trustee for each Existing Indenture entered into a supplemental indenture in respect of each Existing Indenture reflecting the Proposed Amendments with respect to the applicable series of Existing Notes. Such supplemental indentures are effective but will not become operative until payment for the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitations are made. Merger 10 ----- Sub’s obligation to consummate the Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including the consummation of the Merger and the consummation of the Financing Transactions on terms satisfactory to Merger Sub. We intend to fund the repurchase of the Existing Notes pursuant to the Tender Offers with a portion of the net proceeds of this offering, together with borrowings under our New Term Loan Facilities. _Ongoing Evaluation of zColo Business_ As part of our ongoing strategy to simplify our business and focus on the Zayo Networks business, we previously separated our non-core Allstream business and enhanced the independence of our zColo segment to operate on a stand-alone basis. Our Allstream and zColo businesses are each accounted for as separate segments in our consolidated financial statements. We are currently evaluating potential opportunities in furtherance of this strategy, including a potential disposition of the zColo business. However, there can be no assurance that we will enter into or consummate any transaction with respect to (including any disposition of) the zColo business and the timing of any such transaction is uncertain. A disposition of the zColo business would constitute a ‘‘Specified Asset Sale’’ under the terms of the indentures that will govern the notes. See ‘‘Description of the Unsecured Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of the Secured Notes’’ for more details. In the event we consummate any such disposition, we expect to use up to $715.0 million of the proceeds thereof to repay or offer to repay indebtedness. We will have broad discretion over the use of any remaining proceeds and may choose to use such proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the agreements governing our indebtedness, including for dividends and distributions to our equity holders. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, excluding the zColo segment, we would have had $2,329.5 million of revenue, $255.5 million of net income and $1,168.5 million of Adjusted EBITDA. As of December 31, 2019, excluding the zColo segment, we would have had $8,674.3 million of total assets.",N/A,as_expected,2020,390

949,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.37,Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial and Operating Information,9.37.1,,"The following table sets forth our summary historical consolidated financial data and summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data for the periods and as of the dates indicated. The summary historical financial data as of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019 and for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, June 30, 2018, and June 30, 2019 are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. The summary historical consolidated financial data as of December 31, 2019 and for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 are derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. The summary historical consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2018 has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements not included in or incorporated into this offering memorandum. The unaudited financial data presented have been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, such unaudited financial data reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for those periods. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future period. Our audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum do not reflect the impact of the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data has been developed by applying pro forma adjustments to our historical consolidated financial data to reflect the effect of the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 gives pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as if they had occurred on July 1, 2018 and the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet data gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on December 31, 2019. The unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 has been derived by adding the historical consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 to the unaudited historical condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2019, subtracting the unaudited historical condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and then applying pro forma adjustments related to the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations data for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were included in this offering memorandum in order to provide investors with the latest practicable three and twelve month periods available at the time of this offering. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent our financial condition or our results of operations had the Transactions occurred on or as of the dates noted above or to project the results for any future date or period. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information also does not consider the impact of possible business model changes or any potential effects of changes in market conditions on net revenues, expense efficiencies and asset dispositions, among other factors, including those discussed under ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in this offering memorandum and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. In addition, this pro forma presentation does not contemplate changes in tax structure, accounting policies or synergy benefits. Therefore, actual results will differ from the pro forma financial information, and the differences may be material. The unaudited pro forma adjustments reflected herein are preliminary and based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. As 27 ----- explained in more detail in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, under the acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations are based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Management has made a preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on various preliminary estimates. This estimate may differ materially from the actual allocation after the Transactions. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon the closing of the Transactions will depend on a number of factors, including additional information available and our net assets on the closing date of the Transactions. The summary historical data presented below are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. The summary historical and unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data set forth below should be read in conjunction with the information included under the headings ‘‘The Transactions,’’ ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information,’’ ‘‘Selected Historical Financial Data’’ contained elsewhere in this offering memorandum and ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ incorporated by reference from our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2020,390

As such, the consolidated balance sheet data presented above as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 has not been restated (and is not required to be restated) to reflect ASC 842. ASC 842 did not impact the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for any periods presented above. (2) Includes capital expenditures for construction materials and purchases of property and equipment. (3) Success-based capital expenditures is defined as total capital expenditures less maintenance capital expenditures and represent payments for growth-related capital projects that support new infrastructure backed by signed contracts with customers. Maintenance capital expenditures represent payments for capital projects that support the continued viability of our existing network such as certain relocation and restoration expenditures that qualify for capital treatment, as well as the replacement of network components that have reached the end of their useful lives.

Levered free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. Adjusted unlevered free cash flow and levered free cash flow are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, and are not presented in accordance with, GAAP.

In addition, the items excluded from adjusted unlevered free cash flow and levered free cash flow are significant in assessing our operating results and liquidity. Adjusted unlevered free cash flow and levered free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: - adjusted unlevered free cash flow does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - adjusted unlevered free cash flow does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our debt; - adjusted unlevered free cash flow does not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes; - adjusted unlevered free cash flow does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and - levered free cash flow does not reflect principal payments on our debt, finance lease obligations, any dividend payments and the cost of acquisitions. Because of these limitations, adjusted unlevered free cash flow and levered free cash flow should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in business growth or to reduce indebtedness.

In addition, Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings for the three months ended December 31, 2019 includes the run-rate impact (taking into account an assumed margin as reasonably estimated by the Company) for the period presented of the MRR attributable to contracts signed during or after such period, as if such MRR had been received by the Company as of the first day of such period, net of MRR attributable to contracts that were cancelled or terminated or for which the Company has received notice of cancellation or termination.

(g) Represents an adjustment to reflect the portion of stock compensation costs under the 2014 Performance Compensation Incentive Program that is expected to be replaced with cash compensation costs after the consummation of the Merger in connection with new incentive plans. After the consummation of the Merger, we expect to enter into new incentive plans that will result in lower stock-based compensation because the new plans will provide certain employees cash compensation in lieu of stock compensation. (h) Represents the (i) normalization of bonus and commissions expense based on expected cash payments for bonus and commissions expense for fiscal year 2020 and (ii) normalization of unusual severance expense to eliminate severance related to organizational restructurings. We normalize to expected cash payments in clause (i) because bonus expense fluctuated in the prior periods presented based on the Company’s achievement of certain targets and commissions expense is partially capitalized under ASC 606. (i) Represents the estimated public company costs that will be eliminated after the consummation of the Merger. (j) Represents (i) adjustments for one-time items related to reserve releases, legal settlements and accounts receivable write-offs, (ii) adjustments to eliminate professional fees incurred in connection with certain one-time corporate events, including professional fees related to Zayo’s potential conversion to a real estate income trust and its adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 842, (iii) reversal of non-cash gains on the disposal of certain assets, and (iv) one-time reversal of termination fee revenue collected in December 2017 from a customer that entered into bankruptcy protection in May 2017. (k) Represents an adjustment to reflect pre-acquisition EBITDA of the Prior Acquisitions and removal of pre-divestiture EBITDA of SRT to present the business on a normalized basis reflecting the impact of these acquisitions and divestitures, in each case. (l) Represents adjustments to eliminate (i) non-service cost components of the expense for the Company’s defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical plans, such as interest costs and non-cash amortization of actuarial gains and losses, and (ii) impact of non-cash swap agreements with third party infrastructure companies, which are typically entered into to gain access to a portion of such third party’s fiber network. (m) Represents adjustments to reflect (i) upfront cash receipts for indefeasible right of use contracts and qualifying fulfilment revenue (such as installation revenue), net of upfront cash payments for installation costs, which are received (paid) upfront but capitalized as deferred revenue (costs) and amortized over the life of the contract, and (ii) cash receipts or cash payments for operating leases, which are capitalized as deferred rent and amortized over the life of the lease.

(n) Represents the estimated cost savings on a run-rate basis, including headcount reductions, expiration or expected subletting of real estate leases within the Allstream segment and other general administrative and network optimization savings. We expect to implement these initiatives within twelve months of the consummation of the Merger. We cannot assure you that any or all of these cost savings will be achieved in the anticipated amounts or within the anticipated timeframes or at all. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may not realize expected structural cost savings because of challenges and other unanticipated difficulties in optimizing our cost structure.’’ (o) Represents the (i) run-rate impact of MRR for the month ended December 31, 2019 (as if such MRR was the same for each of the three months ended December 31, 2019), (ii) run-rate impact of uninstalled bookings, such that bookings not yet installed as of December 31, 2019 (and excluded from MRR) are reflected in MRR and (iii) reduction in MRR as a result of known churn events as of December 31, 2019. For each of the adjustments in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the adjustment is reflected net of estimated costs associated with these contracts. (6) Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue is defined as revenue plus non-recurring reserve releases, impact of fiber swap agreements, other cash considerations, and run-rate new bookings, net of known churn. Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, and is not presented in accordance with, GAAP.

(7) Total cash interest expense after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions is calculated using an assumed weighted average interest rate of 5.95% on the notes offered hereby and on the approximately $5,060.0 million in borrowings expected to be made under the New Term Loan Facilities as of the closing of the Transactions. Estimated interest rates are based on assumptions of the rates to be effective upon the closing of the Transactions. A 0.125% change in the assumed weighted average interest rate would increase/decrease total cash interest expense after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions by $10.1 million. Additionally, a $100 million increase or decrease in the amount of debt incurred to finance the Transactions (without a change in assumed interest rates) would increase or decrease, respectively, interest expense by $6.0 million per year and $1.5 million per quarter. See ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information.’’ (8) Total secured net debt represents total net debt that is secured, which comprises debt under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the secured notes, and is effectively senior to the unsecured notes to the extent of the value of the Collateral securing such indebtedness, less cash and cash equivalents. (9) Total net debt represents total debt (excluding finance lease obligations) less cash and cash equivalents.

Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings is determined by multiplying Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings for the three months ended December 31, 2019 by four. (11) The ratio of Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA to total cash interest expense is determined by dividing Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA by total cash interest expense. The ratio of Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings to total cash interest expense is determined by dividing Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings by total cash interest expense. (12) The ratio of total secured net debt to Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA is determined by dividing total secured net debt by Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA.

(14) Net new sales (‘‘bookings’’) represent the dollar amount of orders, to be recorded as MRR and MAR upon installation, in a period that have been signed by the customer and accepted by our product offering delivery organization. The dollar value of bookings is equal to the monthly recurring price the customer will pay for the offerings and/or the monthly amortized amount of the revenue we will recognize for those offerings. To the extent a booking is cancelled by the customer prior to the offerings being originated, it is subtracted from the total bookings number in the period that it is cancelled. Bookings do not immediately impact revenue until the solutions are installed. Amounts exclude Allstream. (15) Gross installed revenue represents the amount of MRR and MAR for offerings that have been installed, tested, accepted by the customer, and recognized in revenue during a given period. Installs include new offerings, price increases and upgrades. Net installations represents the net change to MRR and MAR and equals gross installed revenue less churn processed. Amounts exclude Allstream. (16) Churn is any negative change to MRR and MAR. Churn includes disconnects, negative price changes and disconnects associated with upgrades or replacement offerings. Monthly churn is also presented as a percentage of MRR and MAR (‘‘churn percentage’’). Amounts exclude Allstream. 36 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,390

As a result, the Investor Group will have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and will have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of our board of directors or stockholders, regardless of whether the holders of notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, the Investor Group could cause us to make investments that increase the amount of our indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, or to sell assets, which may impair our ability to make payments under the notes. In addition, the Investor Group is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us.

While the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presented in this offering memorandum is based on assumptions regarding the Transactions and other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, this information is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to, and does not purport to, represent what our actual results or financial condition would have been if the Transactions had been consummated. These assumptions and estimates are only preliminary and will be updated only after the 38 ----- consummation of the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presented in this offering memorandum reflects the impact of the Merger on our historical financial information using the acquisition method of accounting, as required under GAAP. Pursuant to the acquisition method, we will record our tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of consideration transferred (i.e., purchase price) over the fair value of net assets acquired will be recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment. The final valuation of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed have not yet been completed. The completion of the valuation upon consummation of the Merger could result in significantly different amortization expenses and balance sheet classifications than those presented in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information included in this offering memorandum. Additionally, we anticipate incurring costs relating to cost savings initiatives, which have not been reflected in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presented in this offering memorandum. The Merger may also give rise to unexpected liabilities and costs. Unexpected delays in consummating the Merger or in connection with the post-Merger initiatives may significantly increase the related costs and expenses incurred by us. If any of these circumstances were to occur, our operating expenses may be higher than expected, reducing operating income and the expected benefits of the Merger. In addition, our actual financing costs may be higher, and our revenues lower than those reflected in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information. Higher financing costs and lower than expected revenues could reduce our profitability and our ability to generate cash, and may reduce cost reduction and other initiatives.",N/A,as_expected,2020,390

We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to fund our day-to-day operations or to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes. Cash flows from operations are the principal source of funding for us. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. If our cash flows are insufficient to service our indebtedness, including the notes, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital and credit markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations and limit our financial flexibility.

Following the Effective Date, obligations under the secured notes will be secured, together with 50 ----- the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, by first-priority liens on the Collateral (subject to other prior ranking liens permitted by the indenture that will govern the secured notes). No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering of the secured notes, and the fair market value of the Collateral will be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, changing economic conditions, competition and other future trends.

Moreover, the lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the holders of any other indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral will share the proceeds of the Collateral ratably with the holders of the secured notes, thereby diluting the Collateral coverage available to holders of the secured notes. As a result, the fair market value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the holders of the secured notes upon any foreclosure, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, bankruptcy or similar proceeding. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral will be saleable, and even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be uncertain. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral may not be sufficient to pay all or any of the amounts due on the secured notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the secured notes from the sale of the Collateral and the obligations under the secured notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness (including, without limitation, the unsecured notes) and other obligations, including trade payables. In addition, as discussed further below, the holders of the secured notes would not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the secured notes exceeded the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral, including the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities), or any ‘‘adequate protection’’ on account of any undersecured portion of the secured notes.

The laws of these states may limit the ability of the trustee and the holders of the secured notes to foreclose on the improved real property Collateral located in that state. Applicable state laws may impose procedural requirements for foreclosure that are different from and that require a longer time period for completion than the requirements for foreclosure of security interests in personal property. Debtors may have the right to reinstate defaulted debt (even if it is has been accelerated) before the foreclosure date by paying the past due amounts and a right of redemption after foreclosure. Governing laws may also impose security first and ‘‘one form of action’’ rules which can affect the ability to foreclose or the timing of foreclosure on real and personal property Collateral regardless of the location of the Collateral and may limit the right to recover a deficiency following a foreclosure. The holders of the secured notes and the trustee also may be limited in their ability to enforce a breach of the lien covenant that will be set forth in the indentures governing the notes and is described under ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Liens.’’ Some decisions of state courts have placed limits on a lender’s ability to accelerate debt secured by real property upon breach of covenants prohibiting the creation of certain junior liens or leasehold estates, and a lender may need to demonstrate that enforcement is reasonably necessary to protect against impairment of the lender’s security or to protect against an increased risk of default. Although the foregoing court decisions may have been preempted, at least in part, by certain federal laws, the scope of such preemption, if any, is uncertain.

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the Notes Collateral Agent, is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents and profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given ‘‘adequate protection.’’ The meaning of the term ‘‘adequate protection’’ may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in its 55 ----- collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the automatic stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of debt it secures. In view of both the lack of a precise definition of the term ‘‘adequate protection’’ under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how, whether or when payments under the secured notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case, the length of the delay in making any such payments or whether any such payment will be made at all or in what form, whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral as of the commencement date of any bankruptcy proceedings, or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the secured notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of the value of the Collateral through the requirements of ‘‘adequate protection.’’ Furthermore, a bankruptcy court may decide to substantively consolidate us and some or all of our subsidiaries in the bankruptcy proceeding. If a bankruptcy court substantively consolidated us and some or all of our subsidiaries, the assets of each entity would become subject to the claims of creditors of all entities. Such a ruling would expose holders of the secured notes not only to the usual impairments arising from bankruptcy, but also to potential dilution of the amount ultimately recoverable because of the larger creditor base. Furthermore, a forced restructuring of the secured notes could occur through the ‘‘cramdown’’ provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Under those provisions, the secured notes could be restructured over holders’ objections as to their interest rates, maturities and other general terms. Also, any disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy case outside of the ordinary course of business would also require approval from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the circumstances).

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Zayo, with Zayo surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings. Holdings and Merger Sub are affiliates of a consortium led by the Investor Group and at the closing of the Transactions, Holdings will be indirectly owned by the Investor Group. At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock of Zayo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such shares (x) that are owned by Zayo, any subsidiary of Zayo, Holdings, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect holding company of Holdings immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) shares held by any of Zayo’s stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal rights) will be automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration of $35.00 per share in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. None of the Company’s stockholders have elected to exercise their appraisal rights, and such appraisal rights expired at the Company’s special meeting of stockholders held on July 26, 2019 where such stockholders approved the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and except as otherwise agreed between Holdings and a holder of an RSU, as of the effective time of the Merger, each RSU outstanding immediately prior thereto will be canceled and terminated and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Common Stock then subject to such RSU. The Merger Agreement contains seller representations and warranties of the Company, buyer representations and warranties of Holdings and Merger Sub and customary covenants and other agreements among Holdings, Merger Sub and the Company. The closing of the Merger is conditioned upon customary closing conditions, including the approval by Zayo’s stockholders (which was obtained on July 26, 2019), the expiration or termination of the required waiting periods under the Hart-ScottRodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (which the Federal Trade Commission granted on July 31, 2019), and other required regulatory approvals, including review and clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (which has been obtained), the receipt of certain foreign antitrust approvals (which have been obtained), certain other foreign direct investment review approvals (which have been obtained) and the approval of multiple U.S. states (all of which have been obtained except for approval from the California public utility commission), and the receipt of FCC approvals (which have been obtained). We expect to receive all remaining approvals in the first calendar quarter of 2020, but cannot assure you that such approvals will be provided in a timely manner or at all. The closing of the Merger is also conditioned upon the absence of any order or law that is in effect that prohibits the Merger, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties, the compliance by the parties with their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement, the delivery of certain closing documents and the absence of occurrences that would have, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect, as described in the Merger Agreement. The Merger is expected to close during late first calendar quarter or early second calendar quarter of 2020, but we cannot assure you that the Merger will close in a timely manner or at all.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION 1.** **Basis of Presentation",1125.7.1,,"The unaudited pro forma financial information is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and reflects the pending Merger. The historical financial information has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended June 30, 2019, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 4, 2019, and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019, included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 4, 2020. The unaudited pro forma financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what our financial condition or our results of operations would have been had the Transactions occurred on the dates noted below or to project the results of operations or financial condition for any future date or period. The unaudited pro forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with the information included under ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ ‘‘The Transactions,’’ ‘‘Use of Proceeds,’’ ‘‘Capitalization,’’ ‘‘Selected Historical Financial Data’’ and our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been developed by applying pro forma adjustments to our historical consolidated financial statements that are incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum to reflect the effect of the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations gives pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as if they had occurred on July 1, 2018, and the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet data gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on December 31, 2019. The unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 has been derived by adding the historical consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 to the unaudited historical condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2019, subtracting the unaudited historical condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and then applying pro forma adjustments related to the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma statement of operations data for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 is included in this offering memorandum in order to provide investors with the latest practicable three and twelve month periods available at the time of this offering. The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations, under GAAP. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations are based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Management has made a preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on various preliminary estimates. This estimate may differ materially from the actual allocation after the Merger. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon the closing of the Merger will depend on a number of factors, including additional information available and our net assets on the closing date of the Merger. The final purchase price allocation is dependent on, among other things, the completion of a valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not completed the valuation studies necessary to finalize the estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related purchase price allocation. We have allocated the total estimated purchase price, calculated as described in Note 4, to the assets and liabilities based on preliminary estimates of their fair values, except for certain assets and liabilities that are presented at 72 ----- their historical carrying value, which approximates fair value. A final determination of these fair values will require a final valuation. This final valuation will be based on the actual net tangible and identifiable intangible assets that exist as of the closing date of the Merger. Any final adjustment will change the allocations of purchase price, which could affect the fair value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited pro forma financial statements, including a change to goodwill and a change to the amortization of tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Any such changes could differ materially from the valuations and purchase price allocations presented in the accompanying unaudited pro forma financial statements. Revisions to the preliminary estimates of fair market values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may have a significant impact on the pro forma amounts of total assets, total liabilities and shareholders’ equity, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and income tax expense. The unaudited pro forma financial information also does not consider the impact of possible business model changes or any potential effects of changes in market conditions on net revenues, expense efficiencies and asset dispositions, among other factors, including those discussed under ‘‘Risk Factors.’’ In addition, this pro forma presentation does not contemplate changes in tax structure, accounting policies or synergy benefits. Therefore, actual results will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material.",N/A,as_expected,2020,390

The Company incurred transaction-related expenses directly attributable to the pending Merger of $4.0 million and $1.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company incurred transaction-related expenses directly attributable to the pending Merger of $17.2 million and $14.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended June 30, 2019, respectively. All such transaction costs have been excluded from the unaudited pro forma statements of operations as they are considered non-recurring. Stock-based compensation expense is included, based on the responsibilities of the awarded recipient, in either our operating costs or selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred charges of $27.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019. The Company incurred charges of $54.2 million and $52.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The Company incurred charges of $110.6 million and $109.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended June 30, 2019, respectively. The amount of stock-based awards is expected to decrease following the Merger; however, the replacement compensation plan has not been determined and, at the time of this offering, the Company is unable to estimate the impact of any replacement compensation plan.

The early tender deadline for each tender offer was 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 31, 2020. The final expiration date for each tender offer is February 14, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated by Merger Sub.

This includes all Part A awards outstanding at the time of closing of the Merger. As such, all unvested Part A RSUs outstanding at the time of closing of the Merger will convert to deferred cash payments at a ratio of $35.00 per RSU. The deferred cash payments require employees to complete the same amount of service as the original RSU awards. Therefore, a portion of the fair value of the unvested RSUs has been attributed to pre-Merger services rendered and included as an adjustment to accrued expenses in the unaudited pro forma balance sheet to reflect the future cash payments associated with settling these awards. As discussed in Note 4a- Preliminary purchase consideration and allocation, Part B RSUs granted prior to May 8, 2019, and outstanding at the time of closing of the Merger, will accelerate and vest upon closing of the Merger. Part B RSUs granted after May 8, 2019, and outstanding at the time of closing of the Merger, will not accelerate. Instead these awards will convert to deferred cash payments that include a change of control premium as set forth in the Merger Agreement. The deferred cash payments associated with unvested Part B RSUs require employees to complete the same amount of service as the original awards.

The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving and continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings, and (ii) at the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock of Zayo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such shares (x) that are owned by Zayo, any subsidiary of Zayo, Holdings, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect holding company of Holdings immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) shares held by any of Zayo’s stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal rights) will be automatically converted into the right to receive $35.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data has been developed by applying pro forma adjustments to our historical consolidated financial statements that are incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum to reflect the effect of the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations gives pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as if they had occurred on July 1, 2018, and the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet data gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on December 31, 2019. The unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 has been derived by adding the historical consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 to the unaudited historical condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2019, subtracting the unaudited historical condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and then applying pro forma adjustments related to the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations data for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 are included in this offering memorandum in order to provide investors with the latest practicable three and twelve month periods available at the time of this offering.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information also does not consider the impact of possible business model changes or any potential effects of changes in market conditions on net revenues, expense efficiencies and asset dispositions, among other factors, including those discussed under ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in this offering memorandum and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. In addition, this pro forma presentation does not contemplate changes in tax structure, accounting policies or synergy benefits. Therefore, actual results will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. The unaudited pro forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with the information included under ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ ‘‘The Transactions,’’ ‘‘Use of Proceeds,’’ ‘‘Capitalization,’’ ‘‘Selected Historical Financial Data’’ and our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum.

In addition, the Issuer’s future Subsidiaries may not be required to guarantee the Notes. 241 ----- Unless the Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including the holders of the Notes, even if the claims of the creditors of such Subsidiaries do not constitute Senior Indebtedness. The Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to holders of Indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors, other than Indebtedness and liabilities owed to the Issuer or a Guarantor. As of December 31, 2019, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and the Guarantors would have had: - $6,247.5 million of secured Senior Indebtedness, consisting of borrowings under the new term loan facilities under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Secured Notes and the related guarantees and finance lease obligations, with $750.0 million available for drawdowns under the revolving credit facility (without giving effect to $8.8 million of outstanding letters of credit); and - $2,302.3 million of unsecured Senior Indebtedness (including the Existing Notes and the Notes). As of December 31, 2019, after giving effect to the Transactions, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries would have had $836.8 million, or 9.9%, of the Issuer’s consolidated total liabilities, all of which would have been structurally senior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur or issue, and on the amount of Preferred Stock that its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors may issue, such limitations are subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications. The amount of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock that may be incurred or issued in compliance with the covenants could be substantial and in certain circumstances, may be Secured Indebtedness. See ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.’’ See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Despite our substantial level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries will be permitted to incur substantial additional indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.’’ Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the incurrence or issuance of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,390

In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of Equal Priority Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations permitted by the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such Equal Priority Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the Equal Priority Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such Equal Priority Obligations or the Equal Priority Obligations Documents governing such Equal Priority Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. None of the Equal Priority Secured Parties may institute in any bankruptcy case or other proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Equal Priority Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral. In addition, none of the Equal Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any Equal Priority Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any Equal Priority Obligation Security Documents or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any bankruptcy case or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the Equal Priority Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other Equal Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies with respect to any Shared Collateral, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent and any other Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and each other Series of Equal Priority Secured Parties, as applicable, upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. The Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes subject to a bankruptcy case and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (‘‘DIP _Financing’’) to be provided by one or more lenders (the ‘‘DIP Lenders’’) under Section 364 of the_ Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (or, in each case, under any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law), each Equal Priority 105 ----- Secured Party agrees not to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (the ‘‘DIP Financing Liens’’) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party with respect to such Shared Collateral opposes or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any Equal Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank equal in priority with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the Equal Priority Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as: (A) the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their security interests on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority relative to all the other Equal Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the Equal Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case; (B) the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted security interests on any additional collateral pledged to any Equal Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority relative to the other Equal Priority Secured Parties as set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement; (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the Equal Priority Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement; and (D) if any Equal Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement; _provided that the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series will have a right to object to the grant_ of a security interest to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to security interests in favor of the Equal Priority Secured Parties of such Series or its representative that do not constitute Shared Collateral; and provided further that the Equal Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other Equal Priority Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such Equal Priority Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral. The Equal Priority Secured Parties acknowledge that the Equal Priority Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other Equal Priority Obligations Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the Equal Priority Secured Parties of any Series. 106 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,390

The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement may be entered into and amended from time to time thereafter without the consent of the Holders to add other parties holding Senior Priority Obligations and/or Junior Priority Obligations permitted to be incurred under the relevant agreements, or their respective representatives. We expect that under the terms of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, at any time at which Senior Priority Obligations are outstanding, the Controlling Collateral Agent or any person authorized by it will have the exclusive right to exercise any right or remedy with respect to the Collateral and will also have the exclusive right to determine and direct the time, method and place for exercising such right or remedy or conducting any proceeding with respect thereto. Subject to the terms of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, the actions and determinations by the Controlling Collateral Agent will be deemed to be the actions and determinations of, and controlling for, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent. The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will apply at all times prior to, during and after any insolvency or liquidation proceeding involving the Issuer or any Guarantor and will provide, among other things, for Lien priorities as follows: (i) the Senior Priority Obligations shall be secured by Liens on the Collateral ranking senior in priority to the Liens on the Collateral securing the Junior Priority Obligations; and (ii) the Junior Priority Obligations shall be secured by Liens on the Collateral ranking junior in priority to the Liens on the Collateral securing the Senior Priority Obligations; in each case, subject to Permitted Liens. The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will not prohibit either the Senior Priority Obligations or the Junior Priority Obligations from being increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified from time to time without affecting the relative lien priorities set forth in the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, in each case without the consent of any Senior Priority Secured Party or Junior Priority Secured Party and will provide that the Senior Priority Obligations Documents may be amended, restated, renewed, replaced or otherwise modified in accordance with their terms without the consent of any Junior Priority Secured Party. The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Junior Priority Obligations Documents may be amended, restated, renewed, replaced or otherwise modified in accordance with their terms without the consent of any Senior Priority Secured Party. Notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of filing or recordation of any document or instrument or grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens on the Collateral securing the Junior Priority Obligations or of any Liens on the Collateral securing the Senior Priority Obligations and notwithstanding any provision of the UCC, any similar applicable law, any Junior Priority Obligations Documents, the Security Documents, or any defect or deficiencies in, or failure to perfect, the Liens on the Collateral securing the Senior Priority Obligations or any other circumstance whatsoever, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and each other Junior Priority Representative, on behalf of itself and each Junior Priority Secured Party under its Junior Priority Obligations Documents, will agree that (1) any Lien created on the Collateral (or purported to be created on the Collateral) securing any Junior 107 ----- Priority Obligations then or thereafter held by or on behalf of, or created for the benefit of, any Senior Priority Secured Parties or any Senior Priority Representative or other agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, possession, statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall have priority over and rank senior in all respects and prior to any Lien created on the Collateral (or purported to be created on the Collateral) securing any Junior Priority Obligations and (2) any Lien created on the Collateral (or purported to be created on the Collateral) securing any Junior Priority Obligations then or thereafter held by or on behalf of, or created for the benefit of, any Junior Priority Collateral Agent, any Junior Priority Secured Parties or any agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, possession, statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall be subordinated to and rank junior and subordinate in all respects to all Liens created on the Collateral (or purported to be created on the Collateral) securing any Senior Priority Obligations. The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if the Controlling Collateral Agent holds a Lien on the Collateral securing any Senior Priority Obligations that can be perfected by the possession or control of such Collateral or of any account in which such Collateral is held, and if such Collateral or any such account is in fact in the possession or under the control of such Controlling Collateral Agent or of agents or bailees of such Controlling Collateral Agent, or if it shall any time obtain any landlord waiver or bailee’s letter or any similar agreement or arrangement granting it rights or access to the Collateral, such Controlling Collateral Agent shall also hold such Collateral, or take such actions with respect to such landlord waiver, bailee’s letter or similar agreement or arrangement, as sub-agent or gratuitous bailee for the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties. _Foreclosure and Application of Proceeds_ The rights and remedies available to the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties under the Junior Priority Security Documents and the actions permitted to be taken by the Junior Priority Collateral Agent thereunder with respect to the Collateral will be subject to the provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement. See ‘‘—Exercise of Remedies and Certain Other Provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement.’’ The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement and the Junior Priority Obligations Documents will require that if any Senior Priority Obligations are then outstanding, the proceeds from any Collateral pursuant to the enforcement of any security document or the exercise of any remedies thereunder, or upon any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to either the Issuer or any Guarantor, will be applied: (1) first, to pay the Senior Priority Obligations as more fully described in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement; (2) second, to pay the Junior Priority Obligations; and (3) third, to the Issuer or such Guarantor; In connection with any enforcement action with respect to the Collateral, including in respect of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, all proceeds from any disposition of Collateral will be applied to the Senior Priority Obligations before being applied to any Junior Priority Obligations. The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will also contain provisions that require the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties to turn over to the Controlling Collateral Agent for the benefit of all Senior Priority Secured Parties any and all Collateral and proceeds thereof received in contravention of the payment priorities of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, for application in accordance with the prior two paragraphs. Furthermore, if any Senior Priority Obligations or commitments related thereto are then outstanding, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties will have no 108 ----- ability to control any foreclosure or other exercise of remedies with respect to any of the Collateral (including, without limitation, the time or method); provided, however, that if none of the Controlling Collateral Agent, any other Senior Priority Collateral Agent nor any Senior Priority Secured Party is diligently pursuing foreclosure or other exercise of remedies in good faith with respect to the Collateral for 180 days after notice by the Junior Priority Collateral Agent to the Controlling Collateral Agent of an Event of Default and of its intent to commence foreclosure or other remedies with respect to Collateral (the ‘‘Standstill Period’’), the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties will be permitted to pursue foreclosure or other exercise of remedies with respect to such Collateral after the end of the Standstill Period. _Exercise of Remedies and Certain Other Provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement_ Subject to the Standstill Period defined above in ‘‘—Foreclosure and Application of Proceeds,’’ prior to payment in full of all of the Senior Priority Obligations (and termination of related commitments), the Controlling Collateral Agent and the Senior Priority Secured Parties will have the exclusive right to exercise remedies with respect to the Collateral, to exercise and enforce all privileges and rights thereunder according to their discretion and the exercise of their good faith business judgment, including, without limitation, the exclusive right to take or retake control or possession of any Collateral and to hold, prepare for sale, process, sell, lease, dispose of, or liquidate any Collateral. Notwithstanding any rights or remedies available to the Junior Priority Collateral Agent or the Junior Priority Secured Parties under applicable law or otherwise, prior to the expiration of the Standstill Period, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties will not be permitted to, directly or indirectly, seek to foreclose or realize upon (judicially or non-judicially) their Lien on, or otherwise exercise any rights or remedies with respect to, any Collateral (including, without limitation, by setoff or notification of account debtors). The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will not (i) preclude the Junior Priority Collateral Agent from exercising certain actions that would be permitted to be taken as unsecured creditors against the Issuer or any Guarantor, and except in any bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding, as necessary to file a claim or statement of interest with respect to the Junior Priority Obligations and in certain other limited situations, or (ii) prohibit the receipt by the Junior Priority Collateral Agent or any Junior Priority Secured Party of regularly scheduled payments of principal of, and regularly scheduled payments of interest on, the Junior Priority Obligations, as the case may be, but in each case of clause (i) and (ii), subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations as will be more fully set forth in the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement. Following the acceleration of any Senior Priority Obligations (the ‘‘Purchase Event’’), within 30 days of the Purchase Event, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and Junior Priority Secured Parties will have the option, by notice to the representative of the Senior Priority Secured Parties, to purchase all (but not less than all) of the Senior Priority Obligations in full in cash. If such option is exercised, the purchase of the Senior Priority Obligations will be required to be consummated within not less than five Business Days and not more than 10 Business Days of the notice. The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will also, among other things: (1) with respect to the Collateral, provide that so long as any Senior Priority Obligations are outstanding, only the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Senior Priority Secured Parties will have the right to restrict or permit, or approve, the sale, transfer, or other disposition of the Collateral in connection with an enforcement of remedies against such Collateral; (2) so long as the Senior Priority Obligations are outstanding, prohibit the grant of additional Liens in favor of the Junior Priority Collateral Agent on any property or assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors to the extent the Collateral Agents for the Senior Priority Obligations have not been granted a Lien on such property and assets; 109 ----- (3) provide that in the event of a sale, transfer or other disposition of any specified item of Collateral, the Liens granted to the Junior Priority Representatives and the Junior Priority Secured Parties upon such Collateral to secure Junior Priority Obligations will terminate and be released, automatically and without any further action, concurrently with the termination and release of all Liens granted upon such Collateral to secure Senior Priority Obligations; (4) provide that if the Junior Priority Collateral Agent or any Junior Priority Secured Party holds or acquires any Lien on any assets or property of the Issuer or any Guarantor securing any Junior Priority Obligations that are not also subject to the Liens securing the Senior Priority Obligations under the Senior Priority Obligations Documents, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent or such Junior Priority Secured Party (i) will be obligated to notify the Controlling Collateral Agent promptly upon becoming aware thereof and, unless such Issuer or Guarantor shall promptly grant a similar Lien on such assets or property to the Controlling Collateral Agent as security for the Senior Priority Obligations, must assign such Lien to the Controlling Collateral Agent as security for the Senior Priority Obligations (but may retain a junior Lien on such assets or property subject to the terms of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement) and (ii) until such assignment or such grant of a similar Lien to the Controlling Collateral Agent, will be deemed to also hold and have held such Lien for the benefit of the Controlling Collateral Agent as security for the Senior Priority Obligations. Any amounts received by or distributed to any Junior Priority Secured Party pursuant to or as a result of any Lien granted in contravention of the foregoing shall be subject to the turnover and related provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement; (5) provide that if any Senior Priority Secured Party is required in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or otherwise to disgorge, turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of the Issuer or any Guarantor (or any trustee, receiver or similar person therefor), because the payment of such amount was declared to be, or otherwise avoided as, fraudulent or preferential in any respect or for any other reason, any amount (a ‘‘Recovery’’), whether received as proceeds of security, enforcement of any right of setoff, recoupment or otherwise, then the Senior Priority Obligations will be reinstated to the extent of such Recovery and deemed to be outstanding as if such payment had not occurred and the Senior Priority Secured Parties will be entitled to a future discharge of Senior Priority Obligations with respect to all such recovered amounts. If the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will have been terminated prior to such Recovery, the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties thereto. The Junior Priority Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Priority Secured Party will agree that none of them shall be entitled to benefit from any avoidance action affecting or otherwise relating to any distribution or allocation made in accordance with the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, whether by preference or otherwise, it being understood and agreed that the benefit of such avoidance action otherwise allocable to them shall instead be allocated and turned over for application in accordance with the priorities set forth in the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement; (6) provide that, upon any insolvency or liquidation proceeding involving either the Issuer or any Guarantor, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties: (A) shall not raise any objection to (i) the use of cash collateral by either the Issuer or any Guarantor if permitted (or not objected to) by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Senior Priority Secured Party or (ii) either the Issuer or any Guarantor obtaining DIP Financing, (B) will not request adequate protection or other relief in connection with any such use of cash collateral or any such DIP Financing, provided that the Junior Priority Collateral 110 ----- Agent or the Junior Priority Secured Parties shall be permitted to (i) seek adequate protection in the form of additional or replacement Liens on the Collateral or additional or replacement collateral to secure the Junior Priority Obligations as long as, in each case, the Senior Priority Secured Parties are also granted such additional or replacement Liens on the Collateral or additional or replacement collateral and such Liens that secure the Junior Priority Obligations shall rank junior to and be subordinated to the Liens securing the Senior Priority Obligations on the same basis of priority as the Liens securing the Senior Priority Obligations rank to the Liens securing the Junior Priority Obligations in accordance with the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, and (ii) if the Senior Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection in the form of a superpriority administrative expense claim, seek and receive adequate protection of its junior interest in the Collateral in form of a superpriority administrative expense claim, including a claim arising under Section 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, provided however that any such superpriority administrative expense claim of the Junior Priority Collateral Agent shall rank junior and be subordinated to any superpriority administrative expense claim granted to the Senior Priority Secured Parties with respect to such Collateral, (C) will not contest (or support any other Person in contesting) (x) any request by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Senior Priority Secured Parties for adequate protection or (y) any objection made by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Senior Priority Secured Parties to any motion, relief, action or insolvency or liquidation proceeding claiming a lack of adequate protection, (D) will raise no objection to (or otherwise contest) any motion for relief from the automatic stay or from any injunction against foreclosure or enforcement in respect of Senior Priority Obligations made by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Senior Priority Secured Parties, and, so long as Senior Priority Obligations are outstanding, will not seek (or support any person in seeking) any such relief in respect of the Collateral without the consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent, (E) will raise no objection to (or otherwise contest) any lawful exercise by any Senior Priority Secured Party of the right to credit bid Senior Priority Obligations at any sale in foreclosure of Collateral, (F) will raise no objection to (and will not otherwise contest) any order relating to a sale of assets of the Issuer or Guarantors for which the Controlling Collateral Agent has consented (or not objected to) that provides, to the extent the sale is to be free and clear of Liens, that the Liens securing the Senior Priority Obligations and the Liens securing the Junior Priority Obligations will attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of priority as the Liens securing the Senior Priority Obligations rank relative to the Liens securing the Junior Priority Obligations in accordance with the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, (G) with respect to the Collateral, will not oppose any sale of assets consented to (or not objected to) by the Controlling Collateral Agent whether pursuant to Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision under the law applicable in the insolvency or liquidation proceeding), in each case, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations as more fully set forth in the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, and (H) so long as Senior Priority Obligations are outstanding, will not assert or enforce any claim under Section 506(c) of the United States Bankruptcy Code senior to or on a parity with the Liens securing the Senior Priority Obligations for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Collateral; 111 ----- (7) provide that the Junior Priority Collateral Agent will not contest, protest or object to any lien enforcement action or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Senior Priority Secured Parties or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Senior Priority Secured Parties of any rights and remedies relating to the Collateral under the Senior Priority Obligations Documents or otherwise and has no right to direct the Controlling Collateral Agent to take any foreclosure or other action; (8) provide that no Junior Priority Representative or any other Junior Priority Secured Party (whether in the capacity of a secured or unsecured creditor) may directly or indirectly propose, support or vote in favor of any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, other than with the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent or to the extent any such plan is proposed or supported by the class of holders of Senior Priority Obligations required under Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code; and (9) provide that each Junior Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Priority Secured Party, will acknowledge and agree that (a) the grants of Liens securing the Senior Priority Obligations and the Junior Priority Obligations constitute separate and distinct grants of Liens and (b) because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the Junior Priority Obligations are fundamentally different from the Senior Priority Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed or adopted in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and, if it is held that the claims of the Senior Priority Secured Parties and the Junior Priority Secured Parties in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims) under a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, then each Junior Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Junior Priority Secured Parties, will acknowledge and agree that all distributions from the Collateral shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors in respect of the Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Junior Priority Secured Parties), the Senior Priority Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees, and expenses (whether or not allowed or allowable in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any distribution is made from the Collateral in respect of the Junior Priority Obligations, with each Junior Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Priority Secured Party, acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Controlling Collateral Agent amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Junior Priority Secured Parties. If the Issuer incurs additional Senior Priority Obligations or additional Junior Priority Obligations that are permitted by the provisions of the Senior Priority Obligations Documents and the Junior Priority Obligations Documents, as applicable, (1) any such additional Senior Priority Obligations may be secured by a Lien having Senior Lien Priority on the Collateral if the Senior Priority Representative with respect to such additional Senior Priority Obligations executes and delivers a joinder to the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement or Acceptable Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement and the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate stating that the additional Senior Priority Obligations are permitted under the Senior Priority Obligations Documents, and (2) any such additional Junior Priority Obligations may be secured by a Lien having Junior Lien Priority on the Collateral if the Junior Priority Representative with respect to such additional Junior Priority Obligations executes and delivers a joinder to the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement or Acceptable Junior Priority Intercreditor 112 ----- Agreement and the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate stating that the additional Junior Priority Obligations are permitted under the Junior Priority Obligations Documents. The Controlling Collateral Agent, any other Senior Priority Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral Agent and applicable Junior Priority Collateral Agent may enter into one or more additional Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreements or Acceptable Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreements in connection with the incurrence of additional Indebtedness secured by Liens on the Collateral having, or intending to have, a Junior Lien Priority ranking relative to the Liens on the Collateral securing the Secured Notes Obligations. The Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee shall execute any such intercreditor agreement upon the receipt of an Officer’s Certificate stating that such execution and delivery is permitted by the Indenture and all conditions precedent relating to such execution and delivery have been satisfied. Without the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent, no Junior Priority Obligations Document may be amended, restated, renewed, replaced or otherwise modified, or entered into, and no indebtedness under the Junior Priority Obligations Document may be refinanced, to the extent such amendment, restatement, supplement or modification or refinancing, or the terms of such new Junior Priority Obligations Document, would contravene the provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement or Acceptable Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement. In the event that the Senior Priority Collateral Agent and/or the Senior Priority Secured Parties enter into any amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the Senior Priority Security Documents for the purpose of adding to or deleting from, or waiving or consenting to any departures from any provisions of, any such Senior Priority Security Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Senior Priority Collateral Agent, the Senior Priority Secured Parties, the Issuer or any Guarantor thereunder (including the release of any Liens on Collateral securing the Senior Priority Obligations), then such amendment, waiver or consent shall apply automatically to any comparable provision of each comparable Junior Priority Security Document without the consent of or action by the Junior Priority Collateral Agent or any Junior Priority Secured Party; provided, however, that (x) no such amendment, waiver or consent shall have the effect of (i) removing assets subject to the Lien of any Junior Priority Security Document, except to the extent that a release of such Lien is provided for in the Junior Priority Obligations Documents or (ii) altering the terms of the Junior Priority Obligations Documents to permit other Liens on the Collateral not permitted under the terms of the Junior Priority Obligations Documents and (y) written notice of such amendment, waiver or consent shall have been given to the Junior Priority Collateral Agent within 10 Business Days after the effectiveness of such amendment, waiver or consent.",N/A,as_expected,2020,390

Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent and the Controlling Collateral Agent is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security without bankruptcy court approval. In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how long payments under the Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case, whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The Bankruptcy Code permits only the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, costs and attorneys’ fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral.

Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise deliver in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,’’ and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 20 Business Days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment Date’’); _provided, that the Change of Control Payment Date shall be delayed until such time (including_ more than 60 days after the date such notice is sent) as any or all such conditions referred to in clause (8) below shall be satisfied or waived; (3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment plus accrued and unpaid interest on all properly tendered Notes, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled ‘‘Option of Holder to Elect Purchase’’ on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) until the close of business on the tenth Business Day after the date such notice is sent (or such later time and date as the Issuer may decide in its sole discretion) (such time and date, the ‘‘withdrawal deadline’’), that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the withdrawal deadline, as electronic transmission (in PDF), a facsimile transmission or letter or other communication in accordance with the procedures of DTC settling forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased; (7) that if less than all of such Holder’s Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be issued new Notes (or, in the case of global notes, such Notes shall be reduced by such amount of Notes that the Holder has tendered) and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered (the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof); (8) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control or such other conditions specified therein and shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that the Issuer reasonably believes that any or all such conditions (including the occurrence of such Change of Control) will not be satisfied or waived by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and 120 ----- (9) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder must follow. If a notice relating to a Change of Control Offer that is subject to one or more conditions precedent (other than the occurrence of a Change of Control) is later rescinded as described in clause (8) above as a result of the failure of such condition(s) to be satisfied or waived (or as a result of the Issuer reasonably believing that such will be the case), the offer described in such notice will not be deemed a valid ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’ for purposes of this covenant. While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Senior Credit Facilities will, and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or any of its Affiliates) becomes a party may, provide that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Unsecured Notes Indenture or the Indenture). If the Issuer experiences a change of control that triggers a default under the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements or results in a requirement to offer to repurchase the Indebtedness governed by such agreement, including the Unsecured Notes Indenture, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Credit Facilities and/or the Indebtedness governed by such other agreements. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements or repurchase such Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements being declared due and payable. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and this Offering—We may not be able to finance an offer to purchase the Notes following a Change of Control as required by the indenture because we may not have sufficient funds at the time of the Change of Control or our Senior Credit Facilities may not allow the repurchases.’’ The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer, and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of 121 ----- Control after the Merger is consummated, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.’’ Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction that does not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party approved in writing by the Issuer makes the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control and such other conditions specified therein, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party approved in writing by the Issuer making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (except that such notice may be delivered or mailed more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date or purchase date if the notice is subject to one or more conditions precedent as described under ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and Notice’’), given not more than 60 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem (with respect to the Issuer) or purchase (with respect to a third party) all of the Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase on a date (the ‘‘Second Change of Control Payment Date’’) at a price in cash equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of the Second Change of Control Payment Date, including, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Second Change of Control Payment Date, subject to the right of Holders of record of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Second Change of Control Payment Date. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a Change of Control Offer, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer, by portfolio companies or funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, or by Debt Fund Affiliates shall be deemed to be outstanding. The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than any Permitted Holder. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it may 122 ----- be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. A Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees so long as the tender of Notes by a Holder is not conditioned upon the delivery of consents by such Holder. In addition, the Issuer or any third party approved in writing by the Issuer that is making the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may, subject to applicable law, increase or decrease the Change of Control Payment (or decline to pay any early tender or similar premium) being offered to Holders at any time in its sole discretion, so long as the Change of Control Payment is at least equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Effective Date, unless, prior to or concurrently with the time the Issuer is required to make a Change of Control Offer, the Issuer or a third-party has mailed or delivered, or otherwise sent through electronic transmission, a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’ or ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge,’’ the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof (or such higher amount as the Issuer may determine (any Change of Control Offer at a higher amount, an ‘‘Alternate Offer’’)) (such price, the ‘‘Change of _Control Payment’’) plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding the date of purchase,_ subject to the right of Holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date (as defined below). Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the 247 ----- address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise deliver in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,’’ and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 20 Business Days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment Date’’); _provided, that the Change of Control Payment Date shall be delayed until such time (including_ more than 60 days after the date such notice is sent) as any or all such conditions referred to in clause (8) below shall be satisfied or waived; (3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment plus accrued and unpaid interest on all properly tendered Notes, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled ‘‘Option of Holder to Elect Purchase’’ on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) until the close of business on the tenth Business Day after the date such notice is sent (or such later time and date as the Issuer may decide in its sole discretion) (such time and date, the ‘‘withdrawal deadline’’), that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the withdrawal deadline, as electronic transmission (in PDF), a facsimile transmission or letter or other communication in accordance with the procedures of DTC settling forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased; (7) that if less than all of such Holder’s Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be issued new Notes (or, in the case of global notes, such Notes shall be reduced by such amount of Notes that the Holder has tendered) and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered (the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof); (8) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control or such other conditions specified therein and shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that the Issuer reasonably believes that any or all such conditions (including the occurrence of such Change of Control) will not be satisfied or waived by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and (9) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder must follow. 248 ----- If a notice relating to a Change of Control Offer that is subject to one or more conditions precedent (other than the occurrence of a Change of Control) is later rescinded as described in clause (8) above as a result of the failure of such condition(s) to be satisfied or waived (or as a result of the Issuer reasonably believing that such will be the case), the offer described in such notice will not be deemed a valid ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’ for purposes of this covenant. While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations.

If the Issuer experiences a change of control that triggers a default under the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements or results in a requirement to offer to repurchase the Indebtedness governed by such agreement, including the Secured Notes Indenture, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Credit Facilities and/or the Indebtedness governed by such other agreements.

If at any time the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $150.0 million, then the Issuer shall within 20 Business Days make an offer to all Holders and, if required or permitted by the terms of any other Equal Priority Obligations and/or, to the extent that the assets or property disposed of in the Asset Sale were not Collateral, Indebtedness that is pari passu in right of payment with the Notes (‘‘Pari Passu Indebtedness’’), to the holders of such Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable (an ‘‘Asset Sale Offer’’), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, out of the amount of the Excess Proceeds (which, (x) in the case of the Notes only, is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof and at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the repurchase of such Notes pursuant to such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and (y) in the case of such Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness, if applicable, is in accordance with the documents governing such Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable). The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer by sending the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to such Applicable Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an ‘‘Advance Offer’’) with respect to all or part of the available Applicable Proceeds (the ‘‘Advance _Portion’’)._ If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes or the Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Notes shall be selected pro rata (subject to applicable DTC 126 ----- procedures as to global notes) and the Issuer or the representative of such Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness shall select such Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased or repaid on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes and such Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered, with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion), and in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds. Pending the final application of an amount equal to the Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Applicable Proceeds may apply any Applicable Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility (including under the Senior Credit Facilities) or otherwise invest such Applicable Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Holder of any Retained Asset Sale Proceeds may apply any Retained Asset Sale Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture and such Retained Asset Sale Proceeds shall in no event and under no circumstances constitute Excess Proceeds. Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, for so long as the repatriation, distribution or dividend to the Issuer of any Net Proceeds of an Asset Sale by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor would (i) be prohibited, delayed or restricted under any Requirements of Law or conflict with the fiduciary duties of the directors of the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, or result in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer, director, employee, manager, member of management, member, partner, independent contractor or consultant of such Restricted Subsidiary (the Issuer hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to promptly take all commercially reasonable actions available under applicable Requirements of Law to permit such repatriation or to remove such prohibition); (ii) be prohibited, delayed or restricted under the organizational documents governing the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; or (iii) as determined in good faith by the Issuer, result in a material adverse tax liability (including any tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Section 956 of the Code and withholding tax obligation) to the Issuer or its Subsidiaries or any Parent Companies, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant and shall not constitute Excess Proceeds and may be retained by the Issuer or the applicable Subsidiary; provided, that, if within 18 months following the date on which application of the portion of such Net Proceeds would otherwise have been required pursuant to this covenant, such repatriation, distribution or dividend of such Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable Requirements of Law, would no longer conflict with the fiduciary duties of such director, or result in, or be reasonably expected to result in, a material risk of personal or criminal liability for the Persons described above, would no longer be prohibited, delayed or restricted under the applicable organizational documents and/or in the good faith determination of the Issuer would no longer have a material adverse tax liability, then such portion of the Net Proceeds shall be promptly applied (net of additional taxes that would be payable or reserved against as a result of repatriating such amounts) in compliance with this covenant. 127 ----- For purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant (and no other provision), the following shall be deemed to be cash or Cash Equivalents: (1) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected on the most recent balance sheet of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or in the footnotes thereto, or if incurred, accrued or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the balance sheet of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence, accrual or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or are otherwise extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale) pursuant to a written agreement which releases or indemnifies the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities; (2) the amount of any trade-in value applied to the purchase price of any replacement assets acquired in connection with such Asset Sale; (3) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by the Issuer acting in good faith to be converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale; and (4) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received in respect of such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value), taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (4) that is outstanding at such time, not in excess of the greater of $300.0 million and 20.0% of Annualized EBITDA of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, shall be deemed to be cash. To the extent that any portion of Applicable Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in dollars that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into U.S. dollars. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the asset sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the asset sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees so long as the tender of the Notes by a Holder is not conditioned upon the delivery of consents by such Holder. The Senior Credit Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or any of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events (including events constituting a Change of Control under the Indenture) with 128 ----- respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder or result in a requirement to offer to repurchase the Indebtedness governed by such agreement, including the Unsecured Notes Indenture. If the Issuer experiences a change of control that triggers such a default or results in a requirement to offer to repurchase the Indebtedness governed by such agreement, we may seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Indebtedness governed by such agreement. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or are unable to refinance or otherwise repurchase such indebtedness as required by the applicable agreement, such default would result in all amounts outstanding under such agreement being declared due and payable, which could in turn result in an Event of Default under the Indenture. From and after the Effective Date, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale unless: (1) other than in the case of the Specified Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in connection with such Asset Sale) at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and (2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap or the Specified Asset Sale, in any such Asset Sale with a purchase price in excess of the greater of (x) $200.0 million and (y) 15.0% of Annualized EBITDA (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), at least 75% of the consideration (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) for such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales completed or contractually agreed upon since the Effective Date (on a cumulative basis), received (or to be received) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. Within 18 months after the later of (A) the date of any Asset Sale and (B) receipt of any Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale (the ‘‘Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period’’), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount equal to the Applicable Percentage of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale (excluding any Net Proceeds from the Specified Asset Sale that are in excess of $715.0 million) (the ‘‘Applicable Proceeds’’), (a) to repay (i) Obligations under the Notes, the Secured Notes or the Senior Credit Facilities, (ii) Obligations under Secured Indebtedness incurred pursuant to a Credit Facility to the extent such Obligations were incurred under clause (a) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ and/or (iii) Obligations under any other Secured Indebtedness, and in each case, in the case of revolving obligations (other than obligations in respect of any asset-based credit 252 ----- facility to the extent the assets sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant to such Asset Sale constitute ‘‘borrowing base assets’’ thereunder), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

provided, that the Issuer may elect to deem expenditures that otherwise would be permissible investments in Additional Assets, capital expenditures or investments in property or other assets within the scope of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), as applicable, that occur prior to the receipt of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale to have been invested in accordance with this clause (c) (it being agreed that such deemed expenditure shall have been made no earlier than the earliest of (x) notice of such Asset Sale, (y) execution of a definitive agreement for such Asset Sale, if applicable, and (z) consummation of such Asset Sale);

or (e) any combination of the foregoing; _provided that, in the case of clause (c) above, a binding commitment or letter of intent shall be treated_ as a permitted application of the Applicable Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of intent so long as the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith expectation that such Applicable Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of intent within 180 days of the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (an ‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’) and such Applicable Proceeds are actually applied in such manner within 180 days of the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (the period from the consummation of the Asset Sale to such date, the ‘‘Commitment Application Period’’), and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason after the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period and before the Applicable Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then such Applicable Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary reasonably expects to enter into another Acceptable Commitment prior to the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period and such Applicable Proceeds are actually applied in such manner prior to the expiration of the Commitment Application Period. To the extent Applicable Proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed amounts that are invested or 253 ----- applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph, such excess amount will be deemed to constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’; provided that any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders of any Notes pursuant to clause (b) of the preceding paragraph shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to whether such offer is accepted by any Holders.

The Issuer (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to invest in Additional Assets prior to receiving the Applicable Proceeds attributable to any given Asset Sale (provided that such investment shall be made no earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the relevant Asset Sale, execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Sale and consummation of the relevant Asset Sale) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with the second paragraph of this covenant with respect to such Asset Sale. For the avoidance of doubt, the Holder of any Retained Asset Sale Proceeds may apply any Retained Asset Sale Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture and such Retained Asset Sale Proceeds shall in no event and under no circumstances constitute Excess Proceeds. 254 ----- Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, for so long as the repatriation, distribution or dividend to the Issuer of any Net Proceeds of an Asset Sale by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor would (i) be prohibited, delayed or restricted under any Requirements of Law or conflict with the fiduciary duties of the directors of the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, or result in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer, director, employee, manager, member of management, member, partner, independent contractor or consultant of such Restricted Subsidiary (the Issuer hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to promptly take all commercially reasonable actions available under applicable Requirements of Law to permit such repatriation or to remove such prohibition); (ii) be prohibited, delayed or restricted under the organizational documents governing the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; or (iii) as determined in good faith by the Issuer, result in a material adverse tax liability (including any tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Section 956 of the Code and withholding tax obligation) to the Issuer or its Subsidiaries or any Parent Companies, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant and shall not constitute Excess Proceeds and may be retained by the Issuer or the applicable Subsidiary; provided, that, if within 18 months following the date on which application of the portion of such Net Proceeds would otherwise have been required pursuant to this covenant, such repatriation, distribution or dividend of such Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable Requirements of Law, would no longer conflict with the fiduciary duties of such director, or result in, or be reasonably expected to result in, a material risk of personal or criminal liability for the Persons described above, would no longer be prohibited, delayed or restricted under the applicable organizational documents and/or in the good faith determination of the Issuer would no longer have a material adverse tax liability, then such portion of the Net Proceeds shall be promptly applied (net of additional taxes that would be payable or reserved against as a result of repatriating such amounts) in compliance with this covenant. For purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant (and no other provision), the following shall be deemed to be cash or Cash Equivalents: (1) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected on the most recent balance sheet of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or in the footnotes thereto, or if incurred, accrued or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the balance sheet of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence, accrual or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or are otherwise extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale) pursuant to a written agreement which releases or indemnifies the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities; (2) the amount of any trade-in value applied to the purchase price of any replacement assets acquired in connection with such Asset Sale; (3) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by the Issuer acting in good faith to be converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale; and (4) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received in respect of such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale and 255 ----- without giving effect to subsequent changes in value), taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (4) that is outstanding at such time, not in excess of the greater of $300.0 million and 20.0% of Annualized EBITDA of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, shall be deemed to be cash. To the extent that any portion of Applicable Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in dollars that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into U.S. dollars. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the asset sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the asset sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees so long as the tender of the Notes by a Holder is not conditioned upon the delivery of consents by such Holder. The Senior Credit Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or any of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events (including events constituting a Change of Control under the Indenture) with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder or result in a requirement to offer to repurchase the Indebtedness governed by such agreement, including the Secured Notes Indenture. If the Issuer experiences a change of control that triggers such a default or results in a requirement to offer to repurchase the Indebtedness governed by such agreement, we may seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Indebtedness governed by such agreement. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or are unable to refinance or otherwise repurchase such indebtedness as required by the applicable agreement, such default would result in all amounts outstanding under such agreement being declared due and payable, which could in turn result in an Event of Default under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,390

The period of time between (and including) the date of the Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date (but excluding the Reversion Date) is referred to in this description as the ‘‘Suspension _Period.’’ The Note Guarantees of the Guarantors will be suspended and/or released during the_ Suspension Period. In the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture; provided that, (1) with respect to Restricted Payments made on or after the Reversion Date and the capacity to make Restricted Payments, the amount of Restricted Payments made and the capacity to make Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) and accordingly, 129 ----- Restricted Payments made or deemed to be made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’, including clause (2) of the first paragraph thereof, (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be deemed to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (j) of the second paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,’’ (3) no Subsidiaries shall be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during any Suspension Period, unless such designation would have complied with the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ as if such covenant was in effect for the purposes of designating Unrestricted Subsidiaries from the Effective Date to the date of such designation, (4) any Affiliate Transaction entered into on or after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (e) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Transactions with Affiliates,’’ (5) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries’’ that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (i) of the covenant described under ‘‘—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ and (6) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made pursuant to clause (f) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investments.’’ On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Upon any Reversion Date, the obligation to grant Note Guarantees pursuant to the covenant described below under ‘‘—Additional Note Guarantees’’ will be reinstated and such Reversion Date will be deemed to be the date on which any guaranteed Indebtedness was incurred for purposes of such covenant, such that a Restricted Subsidiary shall have 60 days from such Reversion Date to provide a Note Guarantee that would have been required to have been provided during the Suspension Period had such covenant not been suspended. During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens permitted under ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’ (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens).

If the Event of Default resulting from such failure to comply with the reporting obligations is continuing on such 365th day, such additional interest will cease to accrue and the Notes will be subject to the other remedies provided under the heading ‘‘—Events of Default and Remedies.’’ 162 ----- Any Parent Company may satisfy the obligations of the Issuer set forth in this ‘‘Reports and Other Information’’ covenant by providing the requisite financial and other information of such Parent Company instead of the Issuer; provided that if such Parent Company is not a Guarantor, to the extent such Parent Company holds assets (other than its direct or indirect interest in the Issuer) that exceeds the lesser of (i) 1% of the Consolidated Total Assets of such Parent Company and (ii) 1% of the total revenue for the preceding fiscal year of such Parent Company, then such information related to such Parent Company shall be accompanied by consolidating information, which may be posted to the website of the Issuer (or any Parent Company) or on a non-public, password-protected website or online data system maintained by the Issuer (or any Parent Company) or a third party, that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information of such Parent Company, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited or reviewed by the auditors. The Issuer will be deemed to have furnished the financial statements and other information referred to in the first paragraph of this covenant if the Issuer or any Parent Company has filed reports containing such information (or any such information of a Parent Company in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph) with the SEC. The Indenture will provide that, from and after the Effective Date, so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Holders: (1) (x) all annual and quarterly financial statements substantially in the form that would be required to be contained in a filing with the SEC on Form 10-K or 10-Q, as applicable, of the Issuer, if the Issuer were required to file such forms, plus a customary ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ and (y) with respect to the annual financial statements only, a report on the annual financial statements by the Issuer’s independent registered public accounting firm;

_provided, however, that (i) the Issuer shall not be required to furnish any information, certificates_ or reports required by Section 302, Section 404 or Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K, (ii) in no event shall such information and reports be required to comply with Rule 3-05, Rule 3-10 or Rule 4-08 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC or contain any financial statements of unconsolidated Subsidiaries or 50% or less owned Persons under Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X or any schedules required by Regulation S-X or contain separate financial statements for the Issuer, the Guarantors or other Affiliates the shares of which are pledged to secure the Notes or any Note Guarantee that would be required under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC or comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, (iii) in no event shall such information and reports be required to comply with Regulation G under the Exchange Act or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC with respect to any non-GAAP financial measures contained therein, (iv) in no event shall such information and reports be required to include any information that is not otherwise similar to information included in the Offering Memorandum, other than information specifically required under clause (2) above, or to contain any ‘‘segment reporting’’ or 285 ----- any earnings per share information, (v) no such information and reports referenced under clause (2) above shall be required to be furnished if the Issuer determines in its good faith judgment that the information or event is not material to the Holders or the business, assets, operations or financial position of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, would otherwise cause competitive harm, or would otherwise constitute trade secrets, privileged or confidential information obtained from another Person and other proprietary information, (vi) in no event shall information and reports referenced in clause (2) above be required to include as an exhibit copies of any agreements, financial statements or other items that would be required to be filed as an exhibit to a current report on Form 8-K, an annual report on Form 10-K or a quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including copies or a summary of the terms of any employment or compensatory arrangement agreement, plan or understanding between the Issuer (or any of its Subsidiaries) and any director, manager or executive officer, of the Issuer (or any of its Subsidiaries) and (vii) no current report will be required to be provided in connection with the Transactions; provided, further, that in the event that the Issuer elects to change its fiscal year end, (w) the Issuer shall not be required to provide annual audited financial statements for the year ended or ending on the date of its previous fiscal year end and shall only be required to furnish quarterly financial statements and information for the quarter ended or ending on the date of its previous fiscal year end, (x) the next period for which the Issuer shall be required to provide annual audited financial statements and other information described in clause (1) above shall be the twelve months ended on the date of its newly selected fiscal year end first occurring after such election and, in connection therewith, the Issuer shall also be required to provide comparative unaudited financial statements for the prior comparable twelve month period and a customary ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’, (y) the Issuer shall be required to provide quarterly financial statements and information described in clause (1) above for the fiscal quarter(s) ended or ending (based on its newly selected fiscal year end) during the period between the date of its previous fiscal year end and the date of its newly selected fiscal year end first occurring after such election (such period, a ‘‘Transition Period’’) and (z) other than as set forth in foregoing clause (y), the Issuer shall not be required to provide any financial statements (whether audited or unaudited), information or reports for the Transition Period (whether on Form 10-K/T, 10-Q/T or otherwise). All such annual information and reports shall be furnished within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day), and all such quarterly information shall be furnished within 60 days after the end of the first three fiscal quarters of the fiscal year to which they relate (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day); provided that the annual information and report for the first fiscal year ending after the Effective Date shall be furnished within 150 days after the end of such fiscal year, and _provided further that the quarterly information for first three fiscal quarters ending after, the Effective_ Date shall be furnished within 75 days after the end of such applicable fiscal quarter. At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and if any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or if all Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either (i) on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, (ii) in ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ or (iii) in any other comparable section, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer. The Issuer will make available such information and reports (as well as the details regarding the conference call described below) to the Trustee under the Indenture, to any Holder of the Notes and, upon request, to any beneficial owner of the Notes, in each case by posting such information and 286 ----- reports on its or any Parent Company’s website or a non-public password-protected website or online data system maintained by the Issuer (or any Parent Company) or a third party which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment, and will make such information and reports readily available to any Holder of the Notes, any bona fide prospective investor in the Notes, any securities analyst (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the Notes) or any market maker in the Notes, in each case, who agrees to treat such information as confidential or accesses such information and reports on such password-protected website or online data system which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment; _provided that the Issuer shall post such information and reports thereon and make readily available any_ password or other login information to any such Holder of the Notes, bona fide prospective investor, securities analyst or market maker; provided, further, that the Issuer may deny access to any competitively-sensitive information or reports otherwise to be provided pursuant to this paragraph to any such Holder, bona fide prospective investor, security analyst or market maker that is a competitor of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries to the extent that the Issuer determines in good faith that the provision of such information or reports to such Person would be competitively harmful to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries; and provided, further, that such Holders, bona fide prospective investors, security analysts or market makers shall agree to (i) treat all such reports (and the information contained therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and the information contained therein for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (iii) not publicly disclose any such reports (and the information contained therein).

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to prospective investors, upon their request, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to the failure to comply with the reporting obligations described under this covenant, will for the 365 days after the occurrence of such Event of Default consist exclusively, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of the right to receive additional interest on the principal amount of the Notes at a rate equal to 0.50% per annum. This additional interest will be payable in the same manner and 287 ----- subject to the same terms as other interest payable under the Indenture. This additional interest will accrue on all outstanding Notes from and including the date on which an Event of Default relating to a failure to comply with the reporting obligations described above this covenant first occurs to, but excluding the 365th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which the Event of Default relating to such reporting obligations is cured or waived). If the Event of Default resulting from such failure to comply with the reporting obligations is continuing on such 365th day, such additional interest will cease to accrue and the Notes will be subject to the other remedies provided under the heading ‘‘—Events of Default and Remedies.’’ Any Parent Company may satisfy the obligations of the Issuer set forth in this ‘‘Reports and Other Information’’ covenant by providing the requisite financial and other information of such Parent Company instead of the Issuer; provided that if such Parent Company is not a Guarantor, to the extent such Parent Company holds assets (other than its direct or indirect interest in the Issuer) that exceeds the lesser of (i) 1% of the Consolidated Total Assets of such Parent Company and (ii) 1% of the total revenue for the preceding fiscal year of such Parent Company, then such information related to such Parent Company shall be accompanied by consolidating information, which may be posted to the website of the Issuer (or any Parent Company) or on a non-public, password-protected website or online data system maintained by the Issuer (or any Parent Company) or a third party, that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information of such Parent Company, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand.

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes; 163 ----- (3) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,’’ such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 180 days after written notice described in this clause (3) has been given; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, any Permitted Receivables Financing or, with respect to Indebtedness consisting of Hedging Obligations, termination events or equivalent events pursuant to the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement which are not the result of any default thereunder by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both: (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated final maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, is in the aggregate equal to $200.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent); (5) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary (other than any Receivables Subsidiary) (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information’’) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other than any Receivables Subsidiary) to pay final non-appealable judgments aggregating in excess of $200.0 million (to the extent not covered by insurance as to which the insurer has been notified of such judgment or order and has not denied its obligation), which final non-appealable judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final and non-appealable, and, in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed; (6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary (other than any Receivables Subsidiary) (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information’’) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other than any Receivables Subsidiary) (the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’);

or (10) the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiary Guarantors that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information’’ would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any security interest in any material Security Document is invalid or unenforceable (other than by reason of the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture and discharge of the Indenture, the release of the Note Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the release of such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Security Documents). If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above with respect to the Issuer) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, any inaction that occurred or any event that took place and, in each case, was either reported publicly or reported to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section with respect to the Issuer, the principal of and interest on all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. If a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must send to each Holder notice of the Default within 90 days after it becomes known to the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it in good faith determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the interest of the Holders. The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any 165 ----- Note held by a non-consenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration and its consequences; provided such rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (2) the requisite holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Subject to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, and except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Notes or the Indenture unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the total then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. These limitations do not apply, however, to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note for the enforcement of payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Note on or after the respective due date expressed in such Note. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a ‘‘Noteholder Direction’’) provided by any one or more Holders (each a ‘‘Directing Holder’’) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a ‘‘Position Representation’’), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a ‘‘Verification _Covenant’’). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or_ Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee. 166 ----- If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe that a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of the Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void _ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraph. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. Subject to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement and certain other restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Issuer will be required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Effective Date and after giving effect to any fiscal year end change effected on or after the Effective Date), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signer of the certificate knows of any failure by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply with all conditions and covenants of the Indenture during such fiscal year. In addition, the Issuer is required within 30 days of becoming aware of any Default to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or waived within such 30-day time period). The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (such other default, the ‘‘Initial Default’’) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, the Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action 167 ----- and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed under ‘‘—Reports and Other Information’’ or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Each of the following events is an ‘‘Event of Default’’ under the Indenture: (1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes; (2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes; (3) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,’’ such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 180 days after written notice described in this clause (3) has been given; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, any Permitted Receivables Financing or, with respect to Indebtedness consisting of Hedging Obligations, termination events or equivalent events pursuant to the terms of the relevant Hedge Agreement which are not the result of any default thereunder by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both: (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated final maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, is in the aggregate equal to $200.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent); (5) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary (other than any Receivables Subsidiary) (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under ‘‘—Reports and Other Information’’) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other than any Receivables Subsidiary) to pay final non-appealable judgments aggregating in excess of $200.0 million (to the extent not covered by insurance as to which the insurer has been notified of such judgment or order and has not denied its obligation), which final non-appealable judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final and non-appealable, and, in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed; (6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary (other than any Receivables Subsidiary) (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as determined as of the most recent consolidated 289 ----- financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information’’) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other than any Receivables Subsidiary) (the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’); (7) any Note Guarantee of Holdings or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Subsidiary Guarantors that together (as determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information’’) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Note Guarantee) or Holdings or any such Subsidiary Guarantor or such group of Subsidiary Guarantors denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee (other than by reason of the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture and discharge of the Indenture or the release of such Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture); or (8) the failure by the Merger Sub to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption, to the extent required, as described under ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above with respect to the Issuer) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, any inaction that occurred or any event that took place and, in each case, was either reported publicly or reported to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section with respect to the Issuer, the principal of and interest on all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. If a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must send to each Holder notice of the Default within 90 days after it becomes known to the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it in good faith determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the interest of the Holders. The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration and its consequences; provided such rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (2) the requisite holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or 290 ----- (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Notes or the Indenture unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the total then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. These limitations do not apply, however, to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note for the enforcement of payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Note on or after the respective due date expressed in such Note. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a ‘‘Noteholder Direction’’) provided by any one or more Holders (each a ‘‘Directing Holder’’) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a ‘‘Position Representation’’), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a ‘‘Verification _Covenant’’). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or_ Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe that a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with 291 ----- respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of the Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void _ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraph. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Issuer will be required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Effective Date and after giving effect to any fiscal year end change effected on or after the Effective Date), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signer of the certificate knows of any failure by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply with all conditions and covenants of the Indenture during such fiscal year. In addition, the Issuer is required within 30 days of becoming aware of any Default to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or waived within such 30-day time period). The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (such other default, the ‘‘Initial Default’’) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, the Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed under ‘‘—Reports and Other Information’’ or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

These operations and procedures are solely 356 ----- within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a ‘‘banking organization’’ within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a ‘‘clearing corporation’’ within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a ‘‘clearing agency’’ registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the ‘‘Participants’’) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers or affiliates thereof), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the ‘‘Indirect Participants’’). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: - upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of the Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and - ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes). Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg) that are Participants. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Restricted Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in DTC other than Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Citibank, N.A. acts as depositary for Clearstream, Luxembourg, and Euroclear S.A./N.V. acts as depositary for Euroclear. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests. 357 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,390

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC.

Neither we nor the trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of the Participants or the Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and we and the trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions,’’ transfers between the Participants will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, crossmarket transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, by its respective depositary. However, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream, Luxembourg participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to 358 ----- which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under any of the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes in respect of such notes for legended notes in certificated form and to distribute such notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time.

This summary deals only with notes held as capital assets (generally, assets held for investment) by holders who purchase the notes for cash pursuant to this offering at their initial ‘‘issue price’’ (the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold to investors for cash (excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler)). As used herein, a ‘‘U.S. holder’’ means a beneficial owner of the notes that is for United States federal income tax purposes any of the following: - an individual citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. Except as modified for estate tax purposes (as discussed below), as used herein, the term ‘‘non-U.S. holder’’ means a beneficial owner of the notes (other than an entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. holder. If any entity classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds the notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an investment in the notes, you should consult your own tax advisors. This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including if you are: - a dealer in securities or currencies; - a financial institution; - a regulated investment company; - a real estate investment trust; - a tax-exempt organization; - an insurance company; - a person holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle; - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities; - a person liable for alternative minimum tax; 364 ----- - a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes (or a person who is an investor in such an entity); - a U.S. holder whose ‘‘functional currency’’ is not the U.S. dollar; - a ‘‘controlled foreign corporation’’; - a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the notes as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement; - a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’; or - a United States expatriate. This summary is based on the Code, United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in United States federal income and estate tax consequences different from those summarized below.

The initial purchasers propose to resell the respective notes at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum to persons reasonably believed to be QIBs (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ Certain of the initial purchasers may offer and sell the notes through one or more of their respective affiliates or selling agents. The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ The price at which the notes are offered may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in this offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if that offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A. Each series of notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to list the notes on any national securities exchange. However, we cannot assure you that the prices at which the notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue after this offering. The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the respective notes at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of, or the trading market for, the notes. 372 ----- We have agreed to pay the initial purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with the offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market. Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases. - Short sales involve secondary market sales by the initial purchasers of a greater number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. - Covering transactions involve purchases of notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. - Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. The initial purchasers also may impose a penalty bid. Penalty bids permit the initial purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the initial purchasers, in covering short positions or making stabilizing purchases, repurchase notes originally sold by that syndicate member. Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. They may also cause the price of the notes to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. We expect to deliver the notes against payment for the notes on or about the date specified in the last paragraph of the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the business day following the date of the pricing of the notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as ‘‘T+ ’’). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally settle in two business days, purchasers who wish to trade notes on the date of pricing prior to the delivery of the notes may be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+, to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement. The initial purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have in the past performed commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. Certain of the initial purchasers (or affiliates thereof) are acting as joint lead arrangers, joint bookrunners, syndication agents, adjustment agents, co-managers or lenders for our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In particular, an affiliate of (i) Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC is acting as a joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner in respect of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, a lender in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility and a joint lead dealer manager in respect of the Tender Offers and (ii) Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC is acting as a joint lead arranger, joint bookrunner, administrative agent and collateral agent in respect of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, a lender in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility and a joint lead dealer manager in respect of the Tender Offers. In addition, the initial purchasers (or affiliates thereof) also have outstanding lending commitments to finance the Merger under a bridge facility. These commitments will be reduced by the amount of the gross cash proceeds of this offering. Furthermore, in the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities 373 ----- (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. To the extent any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates are holders of indebtedness under our Existing Credit Facilities, such initial purchasers or affiliates would receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering. If the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial purchasers of their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers of their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. A typical such hedging strategy would include these initial purchasers or their affiliates hedging such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2020,390
