**_aggregate principal amount of our_** **_% senior notes due 2028 (the ‘‘unsecured notes’’ and, together with the secured notes, the ‘‘notes,’’ and each a separate_**

**_This offering is part of the financing for the proposed acquisition of Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. (‘‘Zayo’’) by Front Range BidCo, Inc. (‘‘Merger Sub’’), an affiliate_**
**_of a consortium led by Digital Colony Partners and EQT Infrastructure. At the time of the acquisition, Merger Sub will merge with and into Zayo, with Zayo_**
**_continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Front Range TopCo, Inc. (‘‘Holdings’’) and assuming the obligations of Merger Sub_**
**_under each series of notes and the related indentures by operation of law (the ‘‘Merger’’). We will use the net proceeds of this offering, together with certain equity_**
**_investments, the proceeds from initial borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined herein) and cash on hand at Zayo, to finance the_**
**_acquisition of Zayo, refinance certain existing indebtedness of Zayo and pay related fees and expenses._**
**_Unless the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering, the gross proceeds of each series of notes offered hereby will be_**
**_deposited into a separate segregated escrow account for each series of notes as described in ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Escrow_**
**_Conditions’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Escrow Conditions’’ and the funds in each such segregated escrow account will be_**
**_pledged as security for the benefit of the holders of the applicable series of notes. In the event that (i) Merger Sub provides notice that in its reasonable judgment_**
**_the Merger (as defined below) will not be consummated on or prior to August 14, 2020 (the ‘‘Outside Date’’), or that the Merger Agreement (as defined below) has_**
**_been terminated in accordance with its terms or (ii) the Merger does not occur on or prior to the Outside Date, Merger Sub will be required to redeem all of the_**
**_notes of each series (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption’’) on the third business day following such date (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption Date’’) at a_**
**_redemption price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such series of notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Special Mandatory_**
**_Redemption Date. Unless the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering, on the closing date of this offering, one or more_**
**_funds or limited partnerships managed or advised by affiliates of the Investor Group will execute a commitment letter pursuant to which they will commit to fund,_**
**_upon the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption, any amounts owed to holders of each series of notes on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, if_**
**_applicable, in excess of the amount contained in the applicable escrow account on such date. See ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Special Mandatory_**
**_Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption.’’_**
**_The secured notes will mature on_** **_, 2027 and the unsecured notes will mature on_** **_, 2028. We will pay interest on each series of_**
**_notes semi-annually in arrears on_** **_and_** **_of each year, commencing on_** **_, 2020. At any time prior to (i)_** **_, 2021, in_**
**_the case of the secured notes, and (ii)_** **_, 2023, in the case of the unsecured notes, we may redeem some or all of the applicable series of notes at a_**
**_price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a_**
**_‘‘make-whole’’ premium, as described in this offering memorandum. On or after (i)_** **_, 2021, in the case of the secured notes, and_**
**_(ii)_** **_, 2023, in the case of the unsecured notes, we may redeem some or all of the applicable series of notes at the applicable redemption prices set_**
**_forth in this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. At any time prior to (i)_** **_,_**
**_2021, in the case of the secured notes, and (ii)_** **_, 2023, in the case of the unsecured notes, we may also redeem up to 40% of the aggregate_**
**_principal amount of the applicable series of notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount of net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the_**
**_applicable redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. In_**
**_addition, at any time prior to_** **_, 2021, we may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the secured notes at a purchase price equal_**
**_to 103% of the aggregate principal amount of the secured notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date._**
**_See ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Optional Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Optional Redemption.’’ Upon the occurrence of certain_**
**_events constituting a change of control, we may be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the notes of each series at a price equal to 101% of the principal_**
**_amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the repurchase date. See ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Repurchase at Option of_**
**_Holders—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Repurchase at Option of Holders—Change of Control.’’_**
**_Following the consummation of the Merger, Holdings and each of Zayo’s existing and future wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our New_**
**_Senior Secured Credit Facilities or certain capital markets or other debt will guarantee each series of notes (the ‘‘subsidiary guarantors’’ and, together with_**
**_Holdings, the ‘‘guarantors’’). Following the consummation of the Merger, the secured notes and the related note guarantees: (i) will be secured by a first-priority_**
**_lien on the Collateral (as defined herein) (subject to a shared lien of equal priority with the Issuer and each guarantor’s obligations under the New Senior Secured_**
**_Credit Facilities and subject to other prior ranking liens permitted by the indenture that will govern the secured notes); and (ii) will rank equal in right of payment_**
**_with all of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness. See ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Security for the Notes.’’ Following the_**
**_consummation of the Merger, the unsecured notes and the related note guarantees: (i) will not be secured by the Collateral or any other assets; (ii) will be senior_**
**_unsecured obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness; and (iii) will be_**
**_effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, including indebtedness under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the_**
**_secured notes, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In addition, the notes and the note guarantees will be senior in right of payment to_**
**_all future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors and structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future indebtedness and other_**
**_liabilities of any of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. To the extent lenders under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities release_**
**_any guarantor from its obligations, such guarantor will also be released from its obligations under its note guarantees. See ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Note_**
**_Guarantees’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Note Guarantees.’’ The notes will not be listed on any stock exchange, and currently there is no public market_**
**_for the notes._**

**We and the initial purchasers have not authorized anyone to provide you with any information other**
**than that contained in this offering memorandum. If you receive any other information, you should not rely**
**on it. We take no responsibility for, and can provide no assurance as to the reliability of, any other**
**information that others may give you.**

**We and the initial purchasers are offering to sell the notes only in jurisdictions where offers and sales**
**are permitted.**

**You should not assume that the information contained or incorporated by reference in this offering**
**memorandum is accurate as of any date other than the date on the front cover of this offering memorandum**
**or as of the date of the document or report incorporated by reference, as applicable. Neither the delivery of**
**this offering memorandum nor any sale made hereunder shall under any circumstances imply that the**
**information in this offering memorandum is correct as of any date after the date on the cover of this offering**
**memorandum.**

**We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the closing date**
**specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the** **business day following**
**the date of pricing of the notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as ‘‘T+** **’’). Under Rule 15c6-1**
**of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‘‘SEC’’) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as**
**amended (the ‘‘Exchange Act’’), trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two**
**business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who**
**wish to trade their notes prior to the second business day immediately preceding the closing date will be**
**required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+** **, to specify an alternate**
**settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who**
**wish to trade their notes prior to the second business day immediately preceding the closing date should**
**consult their own advisor. See ‘‘Plan of Distribution.’’**

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

We believe that the financial statements included or incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum have been prepared in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States (‘‘GAAP’’), and the regulations published by the
SEC, and are consistent with current practice with the exception of the presentation of certain
non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA,
Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings, Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, successbased capital expenditures, maintenance capital expenditures, adjusted unlevered free cash flow and
levered free cash flow, and ratio data and pro forma data utilizing such non-GAAP financial measures,
as well as the omission of certain financial information regarding the guarantor and non-guarantor
subsidiaries and certain audited financial statements required by Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X.

These non-GAAP financial measures, as presented in this offering memorandum, are supplemental
measures of our performance that are not required by, and are not presented in accordance with,
GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful for potential purchasers of
the notes in assessing our operating performance and our ability to meet our debt service requirements.
In particular, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted unlevered free cash
flow and levered free cash flow are measures commonly used by financial analysts in evaluating a
company’s performance and/or ability to service and/or incur indebtedness. Adjusted EBITDA as
presented in this offering memorandum is consistent with Zayo’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in
its reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. However, the non-GAAP financial
measures as presented herein are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. In addition, the items excluded from
these non-GAAP financial measures are significant in assessing our operating results and liquidity.

These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some
of these limitations are:

  - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA
including run-rate net bookings do not reflect capital expenditures, or future requirements for
capital and major maintenance expenditures or contractual commitments;

  - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA including
run-rate net bookings and adjusted unlevered free cash flow do not reflect changes in, or cash
requirements for, our working capital needs;

  - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA including
run-rate net bookings and adjusted unlevered free cash flow do not reflect the interest expense,
or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our debt;

  - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA including
run-rate net bookings and adjusted unlevered free cash flow do not reflect period to period
changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;

  - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA including
run-rate net bookings and adjusted unlevered free cash flow do not reflect the impact of
earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing
operations;

   - success-based capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures, in each case, do not
reflect all of the capital expenditures incurred by us in the operation of our business; and

   - levered free cash flow does not reflect principal payments on our debt, finance lease obligations,
any dividend payments or the cost of acquisitions.

v


-----

In addition, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net
bookings are adjusted to reflect the estimated annual impact of cost savings we expect to ultimately
realize, as well as estimated results from entities we have acquired (prior to the date of acquisition).
These adjustments are presented because they will be permitted under the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes, but you should not view these adjustments as a
projection of results in any period. These adjustments reflect the impact of savings but do not reflect
any cash costs we will incur to realize these savings. Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue and Further
Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings for the three months ended December 31, 2019 also
include the run-rate impact (in the case of Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings,
taking into account an assumed margin as reasonably estimated by the Company) for the periods
presented of the MRR attributable to contracts signed during or after such period, as if such MRR had
been received by the Company as of the first day of such period, net of MRR attributable to contracts
that were cancelled or terminated or for which the Company has received notice of cancellation or
termination. Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA
including run-rate net bookings do not reflect the historical revenue, Adjusted EBITDA or Further
Adjusted EBITDA for such period and you should not view such non-GAAP financial measures to be
projections of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA or Further Adjusted EBITDA in any future period.

Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures and the related ratios should not
be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in business growth or to reduce
indebtedness.

In calculating these non-GAAP financial measures, we make certain adjustments that are based on
assumptions and estimates that may prove to have been inaccurate. In addition, in evaluating these
non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are
the same as or similar to those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of these non-GAAP
financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by
any such adjustments.

For more information, see the financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference in
this offering memorandum. The SEC has adopted rules that regulate the use of non-GAAP financial
measures. These rules require, among other things:

  - a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or
measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP; and

  - a statement disclosing the purposes for which the issuer’s management uses the non-GAAP
financial measure.

The rules prohibit, among other things:

   - exclusion of charges or liabilities that require cash settlement or would have required cash
settlement absent an ability to settle in another manner, from non-GAAP liquidity measures;

  - adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as
nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is
reasonably likely to recur; and

  - presentation of non-GAAP financial measures on the face of the GAAP financial statements (or
notes thereto) or any pro forma financial information.

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this offering memorandum may not comply with
these rules. For a reconciliation of (i) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and
Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings to net income, (ii) adjusted unlevered free
cash flow and levered free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities and (iii) Pro Forma

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

This offering memorandum includes information with respect to market share and industry
conditions from third-party sources. All industry and market data that are not cited as being from a
specified source are from our internal analysis based upon data available from known sources or other
proprietary research and analysis. We believe such data to be accurate as of the date of this offering
memorandum. However, this information may prove to be inaccurate because this information cannot
always be verified with complete certainty due to the limits on the availability and reliability of raw

addition, our internal research is based upon our understanding of industry conditions, and such
information has not been verified by any independent sources. You should be aware that market and
other similar industry data included in this offering memorandum, and estimates and beliefs based on
that data, may not be reliable. Neither we nor the initial purchasers can guarantee the accuracy or

**Our Business**

We are a leading provider of communications and bandwidth infrastructure in the United States,
with an extensive breadth of network in Canada and Europe. We supply mission-critical high-bandwidth
infrastructure for connectivity to customers whose businesses require rapidly increasing bandwidth,
driven by the growth of cloud-based computing, video, mobile and social media applications,
machine-to-machine connectivity and other bandwidth-intensive applications. Our key products include
leased dark fiber, fiber to cellular towers and small cell sites, dedicated Wavelength (as defined below)
connections, Ethernet, IP connectivity, data center colocation, cloud offerings and other high-bandwidth
offerings. We are focused primarily on providing bandwidth infrastructure solutions to our customers
through our owned and secure network (‘‘on-net’’), comprised of dense metro, regional and long-haul
fiber network sections, and through our interconnect-oriented data center facilities. We are a leader
across various bandwidth infrastructure product markets, including dark fiber, mobile infrastructure
capabilities and fiber backhaul for towers and data centers.

Our network footprint includes both large (e.g., New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Paris and
London) and smaller (e.g., Allentown, Pennsylvania, Fargo, North Dakota and Spokane, Washington)
metro geographies, the extended suburban regions of many cities and the large rural, national and
international links that connect our metro network sections. Due to the amount of time, permitting and
capital investment that would be required, we believe it would be difficult for our competitors to
replicate the geographic reach and density of our network assets. As of December 31, 2019, our fiber
network spanned 133,000 route miles and 13.1 million fiber miles (representing an average of
98.5 fibers per route and including approximately 8.7 million metro fiber miles and approximately
4.4 million long-haul network fiber miles), served 400 geographic markets in the United States, Canada
and Europe and connected to approximately 35,000 buildings, including 1,200 data centers.
Approximately 88% of our fiber miles are owned, with the remaining approximately 12% under
long-term leases. Our network-neutral colocation and interconnection offerings utilize our own data
centers located within major carrier hotels and other strategic buildings in 44 locations throughout the
United States, Canada and Europe, and we operated approximately 750,000 square feet of billable
colocation space as of December 31, 2019.

We have designed our network with additional capacity so that increasing bandwidth capacity can
be deployed economically and efficiently, allowing us to provide scalable and tailored on-net bandwidth
infrastructure solutions to our customers as demand for high-bandwidth infrastructure increases. In
addition, through the process of Wavelength-division multiplexing (‘‘Wavelengths’’), many of our core
network technologies provide capacity that allows us to continue adding dedicated channels (or
‘‘lanes’’) of light that accommodate telecommunications traffic without consuming additional fiber. We
believe we have a distinct competitive advantage as large carriers are reluctant to offer dark fiber
infrastructure that could cannibalize their legacy lit bandwidth services, while incumbent local exchange

1


-----

carriers (‘‘ILECs’’) and cable companies are generally focused on growing their mobile and consumer
broadband businesses, respectively. In addition, to date, our only other competitor with a national
footprint has not pursued extensive dark fiber offerings. Furthermore, unlike Zayo, regional fiber
carriers are focused on servicing enterprises but have limited ability to offer multi-geography
connectivity solutions.

Our customer base includes the largest and most sophisticated users of bandwidth infrastructure
offerings, such as wireless service providers; telecommunications service providers; financial services
companies; social networking, media and web content companies; education, research and healthcare
institutions; and governmental agencies. We believe we are a leading fiber infrastructure partner for
wireless carriers globally and approximately 77% of our revenue is derived from our bandwidth
infrastructure offerings. We generally have long-term relationships with our customers due to the
mission-critical nature of our solutions, replacement of which can be costly and disruptive, as well as
our high level of customer satisfaction. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the average
contract length for our Zayo Networks segment was approximately 4.3 years (or 9 years for contracts
for fiber solutions). The average recurring revenue period for each dollar of revenue is approximately
7 years. In addition, approximately 80% of our customers use more than one of our products to
support their respective networks. Our revenues are also highly diversified with respect to our customer
base. As of December 31, 2019, we had more than 7,500 customers, and for the quarter ended
December 31, 2019, our top ten customers and our top 200 customers accounted for only
approximately 27% and 60% of our revenues, respectively. The following chart illustrates percentage of
revenue derived from our customers for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, by industry:

**Finance & Professional Services**
**15%**

**Carrier**
**46%**

**Media, Content & Commerce**
**15%**

**Cloud, Software & Infrastructure**

9FEB202002455101


We are focused on growing our business while continuing to maintain a strong and attractive
financial profile. Our services and offerings are typically provided in exchange for a fixed monthly
recurring fee under multi-year contracts, providing us with high revenue visibility. For the three months
ended December 31, 2019, approximately 98% of our revenue was recurring in nature (after adjusting
for a single customer bankruptcy event). Our capital expenditure investments are primarily successbased, meaning that before we commit resources to expand our network, we have one or more signed
customer contracts that will provide us with an attractive return on the required capital investment.
After committing capital to connect additional customer sites, our goal is to sell additional
high-bandwidth connectivity on these new routes at a relatively low incremental cost to further enhance
the return from our asset base. In addition, because physical fiber and conduits typically have a long

2


-----

lifetime and have ample expansion capabilities, they require minimal maintenance resulting in low
maintenance capital expenditure requirements.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2019, we generated revenue of $653.7 million and net income
of $61.4 million. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, for the three months
ended December 31, 2019, our net loss, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA
including run-rate net bookings would have been $(16.7) million, $340.8 million and $366.6 million,
respectively. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2019, our net loss and Further Adjusted EBITDA would have been $(119.3) million and
$1,393.2 million, respectively. See ‘‘Non-GAAP Financial Measures’’ for the limitations of Further
Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings and ‘‘Summary
Historical and Pro Forma Financial Information and Other Data’’ for a reconciliation of Further
Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings to net income
(loss).

**Bandwidth Infrastructure Industry**

Bandwidth infrastructure, consisting primarily of fiber network sections and interconnect-oriented
colocation facilities, plays a fundamental role in the communications value chain, similar to other types of
infrastructure such as data centers and cellular towers. Bandwidth infrastructure assets are a critical
resource, connecting data centers, cellular towers and other carrier and private networks to support the
substantial growth in global data, voice and video consumption by both business and individual consumers.

**_Industry History_**

Our industry has changed substantially over the years. The first phase of the bandwidth
infrastructure industry occurred with the advent of the internet and the ensuing dot com era in the late
1990s. This led to the first major wave of fiber network deployments as a number of companies of
varying backgrounds and profiles invested billions of dollars in fiber network construction throughout
the United States, Canada and Europe. These fiber network developers included companies with
national and international plans (e.g., Level 3 Communications, Qwest Communications, Williams
Communications) and others with more regional plans (e.g., 360networks, Progress Telecom, OnFiber).
Following these network builds, many fiber companies struggled in the early 2000s due to the lack of
sufficient demand for their high-bandwidth offerings. Bandwidth demand during this timeframe was
limited by the fact that many bandwidth-intensive applications (e.g., streaming video, cloud, mobile
broadband, big data analytics, etc.) were either not yet contemplated or still very early in their life
cycle. Instead, the majority of traffic at the time consisted of low-bandwidth offerings such as voice and
dial-up modem connections. In addition, the similarity of the fiber routes deployed resulted in
significant overcapacity and associated pricing pressure, leaving both a ‘‘last mile’’ gap and heavy
competition and overcapacity along these routes. These two primary factors combined to significantly
limit the fiber network providers’ operating cash flows, resulting in the majority of these companies
transitioning their business models, consolidating and/or seeking bankruptcy protection.

In the following years, a substantial expansion in computing power and bandwidth-intensive
applications drove meaningful bandwidth traffic growth. This growth highlighted the need to address
the ‘‘last mile’’ gap by bringing bandwidth capacity directly to both the consumer and business end user.
The capacity and performance of the consumer ‘‘last mile’’ connection was primarily addressed by the
expansion of cable networks and through mobile network development by wireless carriers (supported
by cellular tower operators). The growing bandwidth demand of business end users was addressed by a
number of focused fiber developers constructing new networks to directly connect to data centers,
cellular towers, government facilities, schools, hospitals and other locations with high-bandwidth needs.
These fiber network companies were generally local or regional in nature and were most often either
survivors of the initial fiber development wave, subsidiaries of a utility parent, or owned by

3


-----

entrepreneurs. Companies also focused on financial discipline following the large speculative capital
deployments of the dot com era.

**_The Industry Today_**

The acceleration in the development of bandwidth-intensive components and applications has
resulted in a significant need to further fill in the ‘‘last mile’’ gap, leading to substantial capital
investments in fiber networks by bandwidth infrastructure providers. Bandwidth infrastructure solutions
support customer applications such as high-definition television broadcasting and video; online
streaming video; cloud applications replacing in-house enterprise software platforms and explosive
mobile data consumption. Companies whose services require large amounts of bandwidth and
enterprises that consume large amounts of bandwidth are struggling to adapt to this rapidly evolving
landscape and the bandwidth infrastructure industry is growing in economic importance as it addresses
this critical need.

In addition, due to economies of scale, there has been significant consolidation in the bandwidth
infrastructure industry, particularly in the United States. We believe this consolidation trend will
continue in the United States and is beginning in Europe and Canada. Combined with the barriers to
new entrants, we foresee continuing consolidation resulting in a decreasing number of bandwidth
infrastructure providers, against a backdrop of continued strong demand for their solutions.

**_Industry Participants_**

We categorize the participants in today’s communications industry as follows:

   - Providers of Infrastructure are companies that own and operate infrastructure assets that are used
to market and deliver infrastructure offerings. We further categorize providers of infrastructure
as follows:

     - Bandwidth Infrastructure Providers are owners of bandwidth infrastructure assets comprised
of fiber networks and interconnect-oriented colocation facilities. Bandwidth infrastructure
offerings include dark fiber, lit fiber (Wavelengths, Ethernet, IP, and SONET) and
colocation and interconnection offerings for the purpose of accommodating customers’
mission-critical traffic including data, voice, and video.

     - Data Center Providers are owners of data center facilities that include raised floor, power
and cooling infrastructure. These facilities house and support customer networking and
computing equipment for carrier networks, enterprise cloud platforms, content distribution
networks, and other mission-critical applications.

     - Cellular Tower Providers are owners of cellular towers, the physical infrastructure upon which
customer antennas and associated components are co-located for the wireless carrier
industry.

   - Users of Infrastructure are purchasers of infrastructure offerings to either provide value-added
services to their customers or for their own private network requirements. We further categorize
users of infrastructure as follows:

     - Communications Service Providers are companies that use infrastructure to package, market,
and sell value-added communications services such as voice, internet, data, video, wireless
and hosting solutions. Examples of communications service providers include wireless
service providers, ILECs, competitive local exchange carriers and internet service providers.

     - End users are public sector entities and private enterprises that use infrastructure for their
own internal networks. End users may also address their needs by purchasing value-added
services from communications service providers.

**_Our Market Opportunity_**

We believe there will be sustained increase in demand for bandwidth infrastructure, driven by the
following trends:

   - Proliferation of data-intensive activities. The proliferation of smart devices and mobile broadband,
real-time streaming video, social networks, online gaming, machine-to-machine connectivity, big
data analytics and cloud computing is expected to continue to drive data consumption and, in
turn, the need for bandwidth infrastructure. Cisco estimates that mobile data traffic will grow at
a compound annual growth rate (‘‘CAGR’’) of 46% from 2017 to 2022 and that IP traffic will
grow at a CAGR of 26% from 2017 to 2022.

   - Digital transformation driving B2B connectivity. End users such as private enterprises (e.g., media/
content providers, financial institutions and hospital systems) and public sector entities
(e.g., governmental agencies and school districts) are increasingly focused on digital
transformation. As digital solutions continue to grow in both volume and criticality, we believe
end users will increasingly choose to directly procure dark fiber access instead of leasing lit fiber
from conventional carriers, in order to gain more security, control and scale in their internal
network operations. For example, many large school districts now provide e-education solutions,
resulting in an increase in direct procurement of dark fiber access from bandwidth infrastructure
providers by these school districts.

   - Increased demand for mobile infrastructure backhaul. The introduction of 5G mobile and the
continuing rise of the Internet of Things (‘‘IoT’’) is expected to increase carriers’ coverage and
densification requirements, resulting in significantly increased demand for bandwidth
infrastructure, specifically for fiber backhaul for existing 4G sites and upgrades for such sites to
5G. According to IDC and Gartner, the number of 5G mobile and IoT subscribers is expected
to increase from zero in 2017 to 224 million in 2023. The CTIA anticipates that in the U.S.,
carrier deployment of small cells required to densify 4G networks and provide the bedrock for
5G networks will increase from 86,000 to 800,000 by 2026.

   - Increased adoption of hosting and cloud services. Businesses are increasingly focused on
transforming and modernizing their traditional data center infrastructure in order to optimize
their IT operations. This has resulted in increased adoption of cloud solutions (both private and
public), as compared to traditional on-premise IT infrastructure or in-house legacy systems that
require significant costs to manage and maintain. According to 451 Research, private cloud
adoption by enterprises is expected to increase from 27% in 2019 to 34% in 2021, while public
cloud adoption is expected to increase from 22% in 2019 to 39% in 2021. The increase in cloud
adoption is expected to drive demand for data center connectivity, fueling an increase in the
overall U.S. data center total addressable market from $46 billion in 2017 to $120 billion in
2024, representing a CAGR of 15%.

As these dynamics play out across various industries, we believe the number of end users directly
seeking access to bandwidth infrastructure, in particular dark fiber, will continue to grow. We believe
that fiber currently delivers the highest bandwidth for real-time applications, provides symmetric
bandwidths for upload and download, is low latency and is not dependent on distance, providing end
users with the best bandwidth solution in terms of speed, coverage, reliability and latency. We believe
there is no technological substitute for fiber available today or in the near term. According to Credence
Research, the total addressable market for dark fiber network is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10%
from $4.8 billion in 2017 to $11.6 billion in 2026.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe the following are among our core competitive strengths and enable us to differentiate
ourselves in the markets where we operate:

  - Leader in Large and Growing Market with Attractive Fundamentals. Zayo is a leading bandwidth
infrastructure provider, operating in an attractive industry with strong fundamentals. We are a
leader in major top-tier markets, ranking among the top 5 competitive fiber providers in 24 of
the top 30 metropolitan statistical areas. Due to the proliferation of data-driven activities, the
focus on digital transformation and increased demand for both tower and data center
connectivity, we believe that the demand for bandwidth infrastructure and, in particular, dark
fiber, will continue to grow. According to Credence Research, the total addressable market for
dark fiber network is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10% from $4.8 billion in 2017 to
$11.6 billion in 2026. As of December 31, 2019, 65% of our backlog (which we refer to as
service activation pipeline) was composed of long-term dark fiber services. We believe our
international and national scale, combined with our historical investments in our fiber network,
will allow us to continue to expand our leadership position.

  - Extensive and Dense Bandwidth Infrastructure Network. We have an extensive network footprint
that includes both large and smaller metro geographies, the extended suburban regions of many
cities and the large rural, national and international links that connect our metro network
sections. As of December 31, 2019, our fiber network spanned 133,000 route miles and
13.1 million fiber miles (representing approximately 400 geographic markets in the United
States. Canada and Europe) and connected to approximately 35,000 buildings. Due to the
amount of time, permitting and capital investment that would be required, we believe it would
be difficult for our competitors to replicate the geographic reach and network density of our
network assets. This provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage as a mission-critical
infrastructure supplier to the largest users of bandwidth across the United States.

   - Significant Revenue Visibility from High Recurring Revenue Stream Supported by Robust Backlog. Our
high recurring revenue stream, combined with the long-term nature of our customer
relationships, provides us with significant revenue visibility. For the three months ended
December 31, 2019, approximately 98% of our revenue was recurring in nature (after adjusting
for a single customer bankruptcy event) and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019,
our average contract length for our Zayo Networks segment was approximately 4.3 years (or
9 years for contracts for fiber solutions), with approximately 80% of our customers utilizing
more than one of our products to support their respective networks. In addition, the average
recurring revenue period for each dollar of revenue is approximately 7 years.

Our high revenue visibility is further supported by our robust backlog. The revenues derived
from our fiber business have increased at a CAGR of 22% from approximately $289 million for
the year ended June 30, 2013 to approximately $1 billion for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2019, driven by increasing demand for fiber as well as growth in fiber revenue
through acquisitions. As of December 31, 2019, we had $20 million of MAR and MRR in our
service activation pipeline, of which 96.4% is attributable to offerings made through our Zayo
Networks segment. We have consistently grown our organic revenue, with gross installed revenue
exceeding churn processed for our Zayo Networks and zColo segments in every quarter since
March 2010.

   - Highly Diversified Revenue Streams. Our revenue base is diversified across geographies, industries
and customers, which reduces our exposure to industry changes and sector volatility and our
reliance on any individual client relationship. We operate in more than 400 geographic markets
and, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, approximately 20% of our revenue was
derived from our international operations. Our customer base is spread across five distinct

8


-----

industries, with our carrier customers (who are blue chip customers with strong credit profiles)
accounting for 46% of our revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, and no
other industry accounting for more than 16% of our revenues for the same period. As of
December 31, 2019, we had more than 7,500 customers and for the quarter ended December 31,
2019, no customer represented more than 8.4% of our total revenue and our top 200 customers
accounted for only 60% of our revenues.

  - Strong Cash Flow Generation and Low Capital Expenditure Requirements. We have consistently
generated strong free cash flows due to our highly diversified and recurring revenue streams, low
maintenance capital expenditure requirements and strong margins. In addition, our capital
expenditure investments are primarily success-based and committed at high returns. On an
aggregate basis and excluding Allstream, we achieved less than two year payback periods on our
capital expenditures in 11 out of the last 13 fiscal quarters. For the six months ended
December 31, 2019, we had Adjusted EBITDA margins of 55.9% and our maintenance capital
expenditures constituted only 1.9% of revenues for the same period.

  - Experienced Management Team Backed by New Equity Owners. Our management team has
substantial industry experience in managing and designing fiber network and network-neutral
colocation and interconnection facilities and in selling and marketing bandwidth infrastructure.
In addition, our management team has significant experience in acquiring and integrating
bandwidth infrastructure and assets. We believe that the vision and network of relationships
brought by the Investor Group, led by Digital Colony Partners and EQT Infrastructure, as
executed by our experienced management team, will allow us to continue our successful growth.

**Our Business Strategy**

We intend to capitalize on our strengths to extend our market leadership by executing on the
following strategies:

  - Continued Focus on Our Customers’ High Bandwidth Infrastructure Needs. The majority of our
customers require more than 10G of bandwidth and many of our customers require multiple
terabytes of bandwidth. The MRR attributable to our top ten customers has increased at a
CAGR of 10% from approximately $26 million as of June 30, 2013 to approximately $48 million
as of December 31, 2019. We expect our customers’ bandwidth needs will continue to grow,
propelled by the continued proliferation of data-driven activities, the focus on digital
transformation and increased demand for both tower and data center connectivity. We will
continue to focus on providing, and increasing bookings for, our high-bandwidth infrastructure
solutions, which we believe are essential to enabling our customers to meet and address these
trends.

   - Leverage Our Existing Dense and Extensive Network. Having already made significant capital
investments in building out our dense and extensive fiber network, we plan on leveraging our
investments by expanding and targeting our sales efforts to solutions that utilize our existing
network and data centers. We estimate that we have a substantial on-net and near-net market
opportunity based on our existing and in-construction U.S. access network. We believe we will be
able to sell additional high-bandwidth connectivity at low incremental costs, which we believe
positions us to achieve high incremental margins and attractive returns on our invested capital
and realize significant levered free cash flow.

   - Expand Our Infrastructure Assets for Long-Term Growth. Our ability to rapidly add network
capacity to meet the growing requirements of our customers is an important component of our
value proposition. We have designed our network with additional capacity so that increasing
bandwidth capacity can be deployed economically and efficiently, and we will continue to seek
opportunities to expand our network reach, both organically and through selective and
opportunistic acquisitions, where supporting customer contracts provide an attractive return on
our investment.

9


-----

   - Enhance Product and Solutions Portfolio by Leveraging Existing Assets. We plan to continue to
commit capital to new lines of infrastructure businesses that leverage our existing assets. For
example, we are expanding into small cell infrastructure solutions provided to wireless services
providers, which involves the provision of dark fiber and related offerings from small cell
locations to a mobile switching center. We believe that selective expansion of our product and
solutions portfolio will drive increased margins and extend our market leadership.

   - Continue to Invest in Our Go-to Market Engine and Salesforce. We have made significant
investments in our sales channel and expect to continue to build out our local sales teams. We
have reorganized our salesforce into customer verticals supported by local business development
resources to enable them to bolster bookings, increase our wallet share of existing customers and
penetrate a wider cross-section of businesses. Our salesforces will continue to focus on
strengthening customer relationships to increase high-margin bookings and reduce churn.

**Recent Developments**

_Tender Offers_

On January 17, 2020, Merger Sub announced the commencement of cash tender offers (the
‘‘Tender Offers’’) for any and all of the Company’s outstanding $1,430.0 million of 6.00% Senior Notes
due 2023 (the ‘‘Existing 2023 Notes’’), $900.0 million of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2025 (the ‘‘Existing
2025 Notes’’) and $1,650.0 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2027 (the ‘‘Existing 2027 Notes’’ and,
together with the Existing 2023 Notes and the Existing 2025 Notes, the ‘‘Existing Notes’’). In
connection with the Tender Offers, Merger Sub also solicited consents (the ‘‘Consent Solicitations’’) of
holders of the Existing Notes to amend the indentures governing the Existing Notes (collectively, the
‘‘Existing Indentures’’) to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants relating to Zayo
Group, LLC and Zayo Capital, Inc. and their restricted subsidiaries, certain reporting obligations,
certain events of default and related provisions in the applicable Existing Indenture, including the
obligation to conduct a change of control offer to purchase all outstanding Existing Notes of the
applicable series in accordance with the applicable Existing Indenture at a purchase price of 101.0% of
the aggregate principal amount thereof in connection with the Merger (the ‘‘Proposed Amendments’’).
The Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations are being conducted upon the terms and subject to the
conditions in the related offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement and this offering
memorandum is not an offer to purchase or a solicitation of any consent with respect to any of the
Existing Notes.

Merger Sub offered, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Tender Offer, to pay a total
consideration of (1) $1,020.00 (including a $30.00 early tender payment) for each $1,000 principal amount
of Existing 2023 Notes, (2) $1,020.00 (including a $30.00 early tender payment) for each $1,000 principal
amount of Existing 2025 Notes and (3) $1,020.00 (including a $30.00 early tender payment) for each $1,000
principal amount of Existing 2027 Notes, in each case validly tendered in the applicable Tender Offer on or
prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 31, 2020 (the ‘‘Early Tender Deadline’’). The early tender
payment will not be paid for any Existing Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline. The final
expiration date for the Tender Offers is February 14, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated by Merger
Sub. We expect to extend the expiration date from time to time such that the consummation of the Tender
Offers will occur substantially concurrently with the closing of the Merger. As of January 31, 2020, holders
of $1,279,830,000 aggregate principal amount of Existing 2023 Notes, $862,783,000 aggregate principal
amount of Existing 2025 Notes and $1,615,115,000 aggregate principal amount of Existing 2027 Notes had
validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) their Existing Notes and validly consented to the Proposed
Amendments. On January 31, 2020, Zayo and the applicable trustee for each Existing Indenture entered
into a supplemental indenture in respect of each Existing Indenture reflecting the Proposed Amendments
with respect to the applicable series of Existing Notes. Such supplemental indentures are effective but will
not become operative until payment for the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitations are made. Merger

10


-----

Sub’s obligation to consummate the Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations is subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of certain conditions, including the consummation of the Merger and the consummation of the
Financing Transactions on terms satisfactory to Merger Sub. We intend to fund the repurchase of the
Existing Notes pursuant to the Tender Offers with a portion of the net proceeds of this offering, together
with borrowings under our New Term Loan Facilities.

_Ongoing Evaluation of zColo Business_

As part of our ongoing strategy to simplify our business and focus on the Zayo Networks business,
we previously separated our non-core Allstream business and enhanced the independence of our zColo
segment to operate on a stand-alone basis. Our Allstream and zColo businesses are each accounted for
as separate segments in our consolidated financial statements. We are currently evaluating potential
opportunities in furtherance of this strategy, including a potential disposition of the zColo business.
However, there can be no assurance that we will enter into or consummate any transaction with respect
to (including any disposition of) the zColo business and the timing of any such transaction is uncertain.
A disposition of the zColo business would constitute a ‘‘Specified Asset Sale’’ under the terms of the
indentures that will govern the notes. See ‘‘Description of the Unsecured Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of
the Secured Notes’’ for more details. In the event we consummate any such disposition, we expect to
use up to $715.0 million of the proceeds thereof to repay or offer to repay indebtedness. We will have
broad discretion over the use of any remaining proceeds and may choose to use such proceeds for any
purpose not prohibited by the agreements governing our indebtedness, including for dividends and
distributions to our equity holders.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, excluding the zColo segment, we would have
had $2,329.5 million of revenue, $255.5 million of net income and $1,168.5 million of Adjusted
EBITDA. As of December 31, 2019, excluding the zColo segment, we would have had $8,674.3 million
of total assets.

**The Transactions**

**Merger**

On May 8, 2019, Zayo entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ‘‘Merger Agreement’’)
with Holdings and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and
into Zayo, with Zayo surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings (the ‘‘Merger’’).
Holdings and Merger Sub are affiliates of a consortium led by Digital Colony Partners and EQT
Infrastructure (collectively, the ‘‘Investor Group’’) and at the closing of the Transactions (as defined
below), Holdings will be indirectly owned by the Investor Group. At the effective time of the Merger
(the ‘‘Effective Time’’), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the ‘‘Common Stock’’)
of Zayo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such shares
(x) that are owned by Zayo, any subsidiary of Zayo, Holdings, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect
holding company of Holdings immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) shares held by any of
Zayo’s stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal rights) will be automatically converted into
the right to receive $35.00 in cash (the ‘‘Merger Consideration’’), without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes. None of the Company’s stockholders have elected to exercise their
appraisal rights, and such appraisal rights expired at the Company’s special meeting of stockholders
held on July 26, 2019 where such stockholders approved the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and except as otherwise agreed between Holdings and a holder
of a Company restricted stock unit (‘‘RSU’’), as of the effective time of the Merger, each RSU
outstanding immediately prior thereto will be canceled and terminated and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Common
Stock then subject to such RSU.

11


-----

The Merger Agreement contains seller representations and warranties of the Company, buyer
representations and warranties of Holdings and Merger Sub and customary covenants and other
agreements among Holdings, Merger Sub and the Company. The closing of the Merger is conditioned
upon customary closing conditions, including the approval by Zayo’s stockholders (which was obtained
on July 26, 2019), the expiration or termination of the required waiting periods under the Hart-ScottRodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (which the Federal Trade Commission
granted on July 31, 2019), and other required regulatory approvals, including review and clearance by
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (which has been obtained), the receipt of
certain foreign antitrust approvals (which have been obtained), certain other foreign direct investment
review approvals (which have been obtained) and the approval of multiple U.S. states (all of which
have been obtained except for approval from the California public utility commission), and the receipt
of FCC approvals (which have been obtained). We expect to receive all remaining approvals in the first
calendar quarter of 2020, but cannot assure you that such approvals will be provided in a timely
manner or at all. The closing of the Merger is also conditioned upon the absence of any order or law
that is in effect that prohibits the Merger, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
parties, the compliance by the parties with their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement,
the delivery of certain closing documents and the absence of occurrences that would have, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect, as described in the Merger Agreement. The
Merger is expected to close during late first calendar quarter or early second calendar quarter of 2020,
but we cannot assure you that the Merger will close in a timely manner or at all.

Upon the consummation of the Merger, we will enter into certain arrangements with entities
affiliated with the Investor Group. Please refer to ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related Party
Transactions’’ for more information regarding these arrangements.

**The Financing Transactions**

In connection with the Merger, we expect to:

   - repay in full and terminate Zayo’s senior secured term loan facility due 2021 and senior secured
term loan facility due 2024 (collectively, the ‘‘Existing Term Loan Facilities’’), of which
$1,755.5 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2019;

   - repay in full and terminate Zayo’s existing $450.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility
(the ‘‘Existing Revolver,’’ and collectively with the Existing Term Loan Facilities, the ‘‘Existing
Credit Facilities’’), of which $50.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2019; and

   - repurchase any and all of the Existing Notes that are tendered in the Tender Offers.

We refer to the foregoing transactions collectively as the ‘‘Refinancing.’’

We expect to finance the Merger, the Refinancing and pay the fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions (as defined below) with:

  - approximately $5,060.0 million of new senior secured term loans comprised of $4,235.0 million
under a new seven-year senior secured dollar term loan facility and A750.0 million under a new
seven-year senior secured euro term loan facility (approximately $825.0 million equivalent)
(collectively, the ‘‘New Term Loan Facilities’’);

  - net cash proceeds from the issuance of $1,000.0 million aggregate principal amount of secured
notes and $2,080.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes, each offered hereby;

   - approximately $6,388.0 million of cash equity contributions from the Investor Group;

   - the contribution by certain members of management of Zayo of their existing equity interests in
Zayo; and

12


-----

   - cash on hand at Zayo and its subsidiaries.

In addition, we expect to enter into a $750.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the
‘‘New Revolving Credit Facility’’ and, together with the New Term Loan Facilities, the ‘‘New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities’’).

We refer to the foregoing transactions collectively as the ‘‘Financing Transactions.’’ We refer to the
Merger, the Refinancing and the Financing Transactions collectively as the ‘‘Transactions.’’ Unless
otherwise indicated, all references in this offering memorandum to the ‘‘Transactions’’ assumes that
$1,279,830,000 aggregate principal amount of Existing 2023 Notes, $862,783,000 aggregate principal
amount of Existing 2025 Notes and $1,615,115,000 aggregate principal amount of Existing 2027 Notes
are validly tendered and accepted for purchase in the Tender Offers, with $150,170,000 aggregate
principal amount of Existing 2023 Notes, $37,217,000 aggregate principal amount of Existing 2025
Notes and $34,885,000 aggregate principal amount of Existing 2027 Notes remaining outstanding
immediately following the consummation of the Tender Offers.

For a more detailed description of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, see ‘‘Description of
Other Indebtedness,’’ and for a more detailed description of the notes, see ‘‘Description of Secured
Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes.’’

**Escrow**

If the Merger is not consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering,
concurrently with the closing of this offering, Merger Sub will enter into an escrow agreement, pursuant
to which the initial purchasers will deposit an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of each series
of notes into a separate segregated escrow account for each such series of notes. The funds in each
segregated escrow account will be pledged as security for the benefit of the holders of the applicable
series of notes until the date that the conditions to release of the funds in such segregated escrow
account are satisfied or such series of notes is otherwise required to be redeemed pursuant to the
terms of the escrow agreement (the ‘‘Escrow Release Date’’). If, among other things, the Merger is not
consummated by the Outside Date, Merger Sub will be required to redeem all of the notes of each
series on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date in accordance with the terms of the indenture that
will govern such series of notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such
series of notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption Amount’’). Unless the Merger is consummated
substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering, on the closing date of this offering, one or
more funds or limited partnerships managed or advised by affiliates of the Investor Group will execute
a commitment letter pursuant to which they will commit to fund, upon the occurence of a Special
Mandatory Redemption, any amounts owed to holders of each series of notes on the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date, if applicable, in excess of the amount contained in the applicable escrow
account on such date See ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Escrow Conditions,’’
‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Escrow Conditions,’’ ‘‘Description of Secured
Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Special Mandatory
Redemption.’’

**Sources and Uses**

The estimated sources and uses of the funds for the Transactions are shown in the table below,
assuming the Transactions occurred on December 31, 2019. Actual amounts at the closing of the
Transactions will vary from estimated amounts due to various factors, including, without limitation,
differences at closing in the amount of outstanding Company shares, unvested RSUs, the amount of
outstanding debt of the Company and accrued and unpaid interest, the amount of debt incurred by us
in connection with funding the Merger, our estimate of transaction-related fees and expenses, changes

-----

in the Company’s working capital and cash and cash equivalents outstanding and changes made to the
sources of the contemplated financings.

If the Merger is not consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering, the
gross proceeds of the notes will be funded into escrow and upon release of the funds from escrow, the
net proceeds of the notes will be used to fund a portion of the Transactions as set forth below. If,
among other things, the Merger is not consummated by the Outside Date, Merger Sub will be required
to redeem all of the notes of each series on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date in accordance
with the terms of the indenture that will govern such series of notes at a redemption price equal to
100% of the initial issue price of such series of notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not
including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. See ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Escrow Conditions,’’ ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Escrow
Conditions,’’ ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of
Unsecured Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

(1) Represents expected cash at closing of the Transactions. As of December 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of
$181.3 million in cash and cash equivalents without giving effect to the Transactions. We expect that at the time of
the closing of the Transactions (prior to giving effect to the Transactions), our cash and cash equivalents will be
approximately $250 million. To the extent that our cash and cash equivalents balance at the time of the closing of
the Transactions is greater than $250 million, such additional cash and cash equivalents will increase the amount of
cash on our balance sheet following the closing of the Transactions. To the extent that our cash and cash equivalents
balance at the time of the closing of the Transactions is less than $250 million, the amount of cash on our balance
sheet following the closing of the Transactions will be reduced by the difference between the cash balance at closing
of the Transactions and $250 million.

(2) In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into (x) the New Term Loan Facilities, which we expect will
provide for a seven-year senior secured dollar term loan facility of $4,235 million and a seven-year senior secured
euro term loan facility of A750.0 million (approximately $825 million equivalent), and (y) the New Revolving Credit
Facility, which we expect to provide for a five-year revolving facility of $750.0 million. We expect that the full
amount of the New Term Loan Facilities will be outstanding at the closing of the Transactions. The amount shown
excludes any original issue discount payable with respect to the term loans, which will be amortized and included as
interest expense in our statement of income and comprehensive income over the life of the term loans. We do not
currently intend to draw under the New Revolving Credit Facility at the closing of the Transactions, but may do so
as a result of a decline in cash on Zayo’s balance sheet on the closing date, to fund additional expenses or for other
general corporate purposes. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness.’’

(3) Represents the aggregate principal amount of notes offered hereby.

(4) Represents cash equity contributions expected to be made by the Investor Group and approximately $112 million of
rollover equity contributions expected to be made by certain members of management of Zayo.

(5) Reflects our estimate of the total consideration to be paid to holders of all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Common Stock that are entitled to receive the Merger Consideration and the settlement of RSUs in the Merger.

principal amounts of Existing Notes that have been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) as of the Early
Tender Deadline. Does not include $222.3 million aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes that were not
tendered as of the Early Tender Deadline. To the extent additional Existing Notes are validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn prior to the final expiration date of the Tender Offers, we expect to fund the repurchase of such
additional tendered Existing Notes with cash on our balance sheet and/or the net proceeds of the Financing
Transactions.

(7) As of December 31, 2019, we had (i) $486.2 million outstanding under our Existing Term Loan Facility due 2021,
(ii) $1,269.3 million outstanding under our Existing Term Loan Facility due 2024 and (iii) $50.0 million of
borrowings under the Existing Revolver. For a description of the Existing Credit Facilities, see ‘‘Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources’’ in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, which is incorporated by reference into this
offering memorandum. Depending on the timing of the closing of the Transactions, the borrowings and accrued
interest associated with the existing indebtedness may vary.

(8) Represents our estimate of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including financing fees, original
issue discounts, initial purchaser discounts, legal, advisory and professional fees and other transaction costs, such as
printing and rating agency fees. To the extent any financing fees, original issue discounts and other fees and
expenses exceed the estimated amounts, we expect to fund such amounts with cash on our balance sheet at the
closing of the Transactions.

(1) Represents approximately $6,388 million of cash equity contributions expected to be made by the Investor Group
and approximately $112 million of rollover equity contributions expected to be made by certain members of
management of Zayo.

(2) In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into (x) the New Term Loan Facilities, which we expect will
provide for a seven-year senior secured dollar term loan facility of $4,235 million and a seven-year senior secured
euro term loan facility of A750.0 million (approximately $825 million equivalent), and (y) the New Revolving Credit
Facility, which we expect to provide for a five-year revolving facility of $750.0 million. We expect that the full
amount of the New Term Loan Facilities will be outstanding at the closing of the Transactions. The amount shown
excludes any original issue discount payable with respect to the term loans, which will be amortized and included as
interest expense in our statement of income and comprehensive income over the life of the term loans. We do not
currently intend to draw under the New Revolving Credit Facility at the closing of the Transactions, but may do so

as a result of a decline in cash on Zayo’s balance sheet on the closing date, to fund additional expenses or for other
general corporate purposes. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness.’’

(3) Consists of (i) $150,170,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Notes due 2023, (ii) $37,217,000 aggregate
principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2025 and (iii) $34,885,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.75%
Senior Notes due 2027, each co-issued by Zayo Group, LLC and Zayo Capital, Inc., which are wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Zayo. Represents our estimate of the aggregate principal amount of our Existing Notes that will
remain outstanding following the Transactions, based on the aggregate principal amounts of Existing Notes that have
been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) as of the Early Tender Deadline. To the extent additional Existing
Notes are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the final expiration date of the Tender Offers, we
expect to fund the repurchase of such additional tendered Existing Notes with cash on our balance sheet and/or the
net proceeds of the Financing Transactions.

(4) Following the consummation of the Merger, Holdings and each of Zayo’s existing and future wholly-owned domestic
restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or certain capital markets or other
debt will guarantee each series of notes. See ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Note Guarantees’’ and ‘‘Description of
Unsecured Notes—Note Guarantees.’’

(5) On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would have accounted

Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will set forth the rights

holders of the secured notes, the Bank Collateral Agent, the
lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
the holders under any other future pari passu first-priority lien
debt (and their representative) in respect of the exercise of

guarantors’ senior secured obligations and will:

                    - rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated
indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors;

                     - rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and
future senior indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors
(including indebtedness under the New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, the unsecured notes and the Existing
Notes);

                     - be effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured
indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors, including the
unsecured notes, to the extent of the value of the Collateral
(after giving effect to the sharing of such value with holders
of equal or prior ranking liens on such Collateral);

                      - rank equally in priority as to the Collateral with respect to
borrowings and guarantees under the New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities and any other future indebtedness secured
by a first-priority lien on the Collateral; and

                     - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future
indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables)
of any non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer.

21


-----

Unsecured Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Following the consummation of the Merger, the unsecured
notes and the related note guarantees will be the Issuer’s and
the guarantors’ senior unsecured obligations and will:

                   - rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated
indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors;

                    - rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and
future senior indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors
(including indebtedness under the New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, the secured notes and the Existing Notes);

                    - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured
indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors, including
indebtedness under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities
and the secured notes, to the extent of the value of the
collateral securing such indebtedness; and

                    - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future
indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables)
of any non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer.

As of December 31, 2019, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom
as described under ‘‘Use of Proceeds,’’ (1) we would have had
approximately $8,549.8 million of senior indebtedness
outstanding, including the notes, (2) the unsecured notes and
the related guarantees would have ranked effectively junior to
approximately $6,247.5 million of secured indebtedness,
consisting of borrowings under our New Term Loan Facilities,
the secured notes, the related guarantees and our finance
lease obligations, to the extent of the value of the collateral
securing such secured indebtedness, (3) the secured notes and
the related guarantees would have ranked pari passu in right
of payment with approximately $5,060.0 million of secured
indebtedness consisting of borrowings under our New Term
Loan Facilities, would have ranked effectively senior to
approximately $2,302.3 million of senior unsecured
indebtedness consisting of the Existing Notes, the unsecured
notes and the related guarantees and would have ranked
effectively junior to approximately $187.5 million of finance
lease obligations with respect to the assets subject thereto, and
(4) we would have had additional unused availability under
our New Revolving Credit Facility of $750.0 million (without
giving effect to $8.8 million of outstanding letters of credit).
We also may incur additional secured indebtedness if certain
specified conditions are met under the credit agreement that
will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby.

As of December 31, 2019, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the Transactions, our non-guarantor subsidiaries
would not have had any indebtedness (excluding intercompany
liabilities) outstanding.

22


-----

On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions,
our non-guarantor subsidiaries would have accounted for
approximately $517.5 million, or 20.0%, of our consolidated
total revenue, approximately $82.5 million, or 25.8%, of our
consolidated operating income, and approximately
$190.2 million, or 14.8%, of our consolidated Adjusted
EBITDA, in each case for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2019. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted
for approximately $1,487.7 million, or 14.9%, of our
consolidated total assets, and approximately $836.8 million, or
9.9%, of our consolidated total liabilities, in each case as of
December 31, 2019.

**Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . .** We may redeem some or all of each series of notes at any
time prior to (i), 2021, in the case of the secured
notes, and (ii), 2023, in the case of the unseccured
notes, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the applicable series of notes to be redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the
redemption date, plus a ‘‘make-whole premium,’’ as described
under ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Optional Redemption
and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Optional
Redemption.’’ At any time on or after (i), 2021, in
the case of the secured notes, and (ii), 2023, in the
case of the unsecured notes, we may redeem some or all of
the applicable series of notes at the applicable redemption
prices described under ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—
Optional Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured
Notes—Optional Redemption’’ plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.

At any time prior to, 2021, we may redeem up
to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the secured notes
at a purchase price equal to 103% of the aggregate principal
amount of the secured notes to be redeemed, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption
date.

Additionally, from time to time prior to (i), 2021, in
the case of the secured notes, and (ii), 2023, in the
case of the unsecured notes, we may redeem up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of notes at
a redemption price equal to (x) % of the principal
amount thereof, in the case of the secured notes, and
(y) % of the principal amount thereof, in the case of the
unsecured notes, in each case in an aggregate amount equal to
or less than the amount of net cash proceeds that we raise in
one or more equity offerings, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.

23


-----

**Change of Control Offer . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain kinds of changes of control,
you will have the right, as holders of the notes, to require us
to repurchase some or all of your notes at a price equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the repurchase
date. See ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Repurchase at the
Option of Holders—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘Description of
Unsecured Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
Change of Control.’’

We may not be able to pay you the required price for notes
you present to us at the time of a change of control, because:

                    - we may not have enough funds at that time; or

                    - the terms of our indebtedness under our New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities may prevent us from making such
payment.

See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the
Notes—We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a
change of control, which would result in a default under the
indentures that will govern the notes and would materially
adversely affect our business and financial condition.’’

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Each indenture that will govern a series of notes will contain
covenants that, among other things, will limit the Issuer’s
ability and the ability of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries to:

                     - incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;

                     - incur liens that secure indebtedness;

                     - make certain distributions, investments and other restricted
payments;

                      - sell or transfer certain assets;

                      - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and

                     - merge or consolidate or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.

These covenants are subject to important exceptions and
qualifications as described under ‘‘Description of Secured
Notes—Certain Covenants’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured
Notes—Certain Covenants.’’ Many of these covenants will be
suspended with respect to a particular series of notes if such
series of notes has investment grade ratings from any two of
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (‘‘Moody’s’’), Standard &
Poor’s Financial Services LLC (‘‘S&P’’) and Fitch Inc.
(‘‘Fitch’’) and no default has occurred and is continuing with
respect to such series of notes. See ‘‘Description of Secured
Notes—Certain Covenants’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured
Notes—Certain Covenants.’’

**Transfer Restrictions; No Registration**
**Rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes and the note guarantees have not been registered
under the Securities Act or any state or other securities laws,
and we are under no obligation to so register the notes. The
notes are subject to restrictions on transfer and may not be
offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ We do not intend
to list the notes on any securities exchange. We do not intend
to issue registered notes in exchange for the notes, and the
absence of registration rights may adversely impact the
transferability of the notes. See ‘‘Notice to Investors’’ and
‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the
Notes—Holders of the notes will not be entitled to
registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register
the notes under applicable securities laws. There are
restrictions on your ability to transfer and resell the notes
without registration under applicable securities laws.’’

**No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes will be new securities for which there is currently
no market. Although the initial purchasers have informed us
that they intend to make a market in the notes, they are not
obligated to do so, and they may discontinue market making
activities at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you that a liquid market for the notes will develop or,
if such a market develops, that it will be maintained.

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously
with the closing of this offering, we intend to use the proceeds
from this offering, together with proceeds from initial
borrowings under the New Term Loan Facilities, certain equity
contributions and cash on hand, to consummate the
Transactions. If the Merger is not consummated substantially
simultaneously with the closing of this offering, the gross
proceeds of the notes will be funded into escrow and upon the
release of the funds from escrow, we will use the net proceeds
from the notes, together with proceeds from initial borrowings
under the New Term Loan Facilities, certain equity
contributions and cash on hand, to consummate the
Transactions or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the
escrow agreement. If, among other things, the Merger is not
consummated by the Outside Date, Merger Sub will be
required to redeem all of the notes of each series on the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date in accordance with the
terms of the applicable indenture that will govern such series
of notes at a redemption price equal to the Special Mandatory
Redemption Amount. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’, ‘‘Description of
Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Escrow Conditions,’’
‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
Escrow Conditions,’’ and ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—
Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of
Unsecured Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

**Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial and Operating Information**

The following table sets forth our summary historical consolidated financial data and summary
unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data for the periods and as of the dates indicated. The
summary historical financial data as of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019 and for each of the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2017, June 30, 2018, and June 30, 2019 are derived from our audited consolidated
financial statements incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum.

The summary historical consolidated financial data as of December 31, 2019 and for the six
months ended December 31, 2018 and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 are
derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference into
this offering memorandum. The summary historical consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31,
2018 has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements not included in or
incorporated into this offering memorandum. The unaudited financial data presented have been
prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of
management, such unaudited financial data reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal and
recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for those periods. The results of
operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
full year or any future period.

Our audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum do not reflect the impact of the
Transactions.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data has been developed by applying pro forma
adjustments to our historical consolidated financial data to reflect the effect of the Transactions. The
unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the three and twelve months ended
December 31, 2019 gives pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as if they had
occurred on July 1, 2018 and the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet data gives effect to
the Transactions as if they had occurred on December 31, 2019. The unaudited pro forma statement of
operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 has been derived by adding the historical
consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 to the unaudited historical
condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2019,
subtracting the unaudited historical condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months
ended December 31, 2018 and then applying pro forma adjustments related to the Transactions. The
unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations data for the three and twelve months ended
December 31, 2019 were included in this offering memorandum in order to provide investors with the
latest practicable three and twelve month periods available at the time of this offering. The unaudited
pro forma consolidated financial data is presented for informational purposes only and does not
purport to represent our financial condition or our results of operations had the Transactions occurred
on or as of the dates noted above or to project the results for any future date or period. The unaudited
pro forma consolidated financial information also does not consider the impact of possible business
model changes or any potential effects of changes in market conditions on net revenues, expense
efficiencies and asset dispositions, among other factors, including those discussed under ‘‘Risk Factors’’
in this offering memorandum and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2019 incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. In addition, this
pro forma presentation does not contemplate changes in tax structure, accounting policies or synergy
benefits. Therefore, actual results will differ from the pro forma financial information, and the
differences may be material.

The unaudited pro forma adjustments reflected herein are preliminary and based upon available
information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The
Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. As

27


-----

explained in more detail in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, under the acquisition method of
accounting, the total estimated purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the net tangible and
intangible assets based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations are based on available
information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Management has made a
preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed based on various preliminary estimates. This estimate may differ materially from
the actual allocation after the Transactions. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial
statements upon the closing of the Transactions will depend on a number of factors, including
additional information available and our net assets on the closing date of the Transactions.

The summary historical data presented below are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for any future period. The summary historical and unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
data set forth below should be read in conjunction with the information included under the headings
‘‘The Transactions,’’ ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information,’’ ‘‘Selected Historical
Financial Data’’ contained elsewhere in this offering memorandum and ‘‘Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ incorporated by reference from our
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 and our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and our consolidated financial statements and
related notes thereto incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum.

(1) On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (‘‘ASU’’) 2014-09, Revenue from
_Contracts with Customers (‘‘ASC 606’’). Results for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 shown above have been_
retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASC 606. Total stockholders’ equity as of June 30, 2018 has been
retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASC 606. See Note 2 and Note 15 in the Company’s audited financial
statements incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum for additional disclosure on the Company’s adoption
of ASC 606 and its impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Additionally, on July 1, 2019, the Company adopted the requirements of ASU 2016-02, Leases (‘‘ASC 842’’). The Company
adopted ASC 842 effective July 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, the

29


-----

Company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, rather than
restating any prior periods. As such, the consolidated balance sheet data presented above as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 has
not been restated (and is not required to be restated) to reflect ASC 842. ASC 842 did not impact the Company’s
consolidated statement of operations for any periods presented above.

(2) Includes capital expenditures for construction materials and purchases of property and equipment.

(3) Success-based capital expenditures is defined as total capital expenditures less maintenance capital expenditures and
represent payments for growth-related capital projects that support new infrastructure backed by signed contracts with
customers. Maintenance capital expenditures represent payments for capital projects that support the continued viability of
our existing network such as certain relocation and restoration expenditures that qualify for capital treatment, as well as the
replacement of network components that have reached the end of their useful lives.

(4) Adjusted unlevered free cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less purchases of property and equipment, plus additions
to deferred revenue, less non-cash monthly amortized revenue. Levered free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by
operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.

Adjusted unlevered free cash flow and levered free cash flow are supplemental measures of our performance that are not
required by, and are not presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that adjusted unlevered free cash flow and
levered free cash flow may be useful for potential purchasers of the notes in assessing our operating performance and our
ability to meet our debt service requirements. However, such non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein are not
necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
In addition, the items excluded from adjusted unlevered free cash flow and levered free cash flow are significant in
assessing our operating results and liquidity.

Adjusted unlevered free cash flow and levered free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations
are:

   - adjusted unlevered free cash flow does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

   - adjusted unlevered free cash flow does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service
interest payments on our debt;

   - adjusted unlevered free cash flow does not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash
necessary to pay income taxes;

   - adjusted unlevered free cash flow does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider
not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and

   - levered free cash flow does not reflect principal payments on our debt, finance lease obligations, any dividend payments
and the cost of acquisitions.

Because of these limitations, adjusted unlevered free cash flow and levered free cash flow should not be considered as
measures of discretionary cash available to invest in business growth or to reduce indebtedness. See ‘‘Non-GAAP Financial
Measures.’’

(5) We define (i) EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes and depreciation
and amortization expense, (ii) Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude transaction costs, stock-based
compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, foreign currency loss (gain) on intercompany loans, gain on business
dispositions and non-cash loss on investments, (iii) Further Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to
reflect stock-based compensation replacement cost, normalization of cash bonuses and severance, public company cost
savings, non-recurring or unusual items, pro forma impact of prior acquisitions and divestitures, contracted costs, other cash
considerations and cost savings initiatives and (iv) Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings as Further
Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to reflect run-rate new bookings, net of known churn. We describe these adjustments
reconciling net income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA
including run-rate net bookings, in the table below.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings
are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, and are not presented in accordance with, GAAP.
We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate
net bookings may be useful for potential purchasers of the notes in assessing our operating performance and our ability to
meet our debt service requirements. However, such non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein are not necessarily
comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. In addition,

the items excluded from EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA including
run-rate net bookings are significant in assessing our operating results and liquidity.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings
have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our
results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

- they do not reflect capital expenditures, or future requirements for capital and major maintenance expenditures or
contractual commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes; and

- they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our
ongoing operations.

In addition, Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings for the three months ended December 31, 2019
includes the run-rate impact (taking into account an assumed margin as reasonably estimated by the Company) for the
period presented of the MRR attributable to contracts signed during or after such period, as if such MRR had been
received by the Company as of the first day of such period, net of MRR attributable to contracts that were cancelled or
terminated or for which the Company has received notice of cancellation or termination. Further Adjusted EBITDA
including run-rate net bookings does not reflect the historical Adjusted EBITDA or Further Adjusted EBITDA for such
period and you should not view Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings to be projections of Adjusted
EBITDA or Further Adjusted EBITDA in any future period.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA
including run-rate net bookings and the related ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available
to invest in business growth or to reduce indebtedness. See ‘‘Non-GAAP Financial Measures.’’

(a) Represents the transaction costs related to the Merger, as well as those related to the acquisitions of Electric
Lightwave in March 2017, Optic Zoo Networks in January 2018, Spread Networks in February 2018 and Neutral
Path in April 2018 (collectively, the ‘‘Prior Acquisitions’’) and the divestiture of Scott-Rice Telephone Co. (‘‘SRT’’)
in July 2018.

(b) Represents the non-cash stock compensation under the 2014 Performance Compensation Incentive Program.

(c) Represents the expenses related to an amendment and early repayment of the Existing Credit Facilities in January
2017 and April 2017, respectively, and subsequent repricing of the Existing Credit Facilities in July 2017.

33


-----

(d) Represents a non-cash loss on intercompany loans primarily to the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries, which were
established to fund international acquisitions.

(e) Represents the removal of a non-cash gain on the divestiture of SRT.

(f) Represents the non-cash loss on equity and cost method investments relating to several of the Company’s small
investments for which it received an allocation of income or loss.

(g) Represents an adjustment to reflect the portion of stock compensation costs under the 2014 Performance
Compensation Incentive Program that is expected to be replaced with cash compensation costs after the
consummation of the Merger in connection with new incentive plans. After the consummation of the Merger, we
expect to enter into new incentive plans that will result in lower stock-based compensation because the new plans
will provide certain employees cash compensation in lieu of stock compensation.

(h) Represents the (i) normalization of bonus and commissions expense based on expected cash payments for bonus
and commissions expense for fiscal year 2020 and (ii) normalization of unusual severance expense to eliminate
severance related to organizational restructurings. We normalize to expected cash payments in clause (i) because
bonus expense fluctuated in the prior periods presented based on the Company’s achievement of certain targets
and commissions expense is partially capitalized under ASC 606.

(i) Represents the estimated public company costs that will be eliminated after the consummation of the Merger.

(j) Represents (i) adjustments for one-time items related to reserve releases, legal settlements and accounts receivable
write-offs, (ii) adjustments to eliminate professional fees incurred in connection with certain one-time corporate
events, including professional fees related to Zayo’s potential conversion to a real estate income trust and its
adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 842, (iii) reversal of non-cash gains on the disposal of certain assets, and
(iv) one-time reversal of termination fee revenue collected in December 2017 from a customer that entered into
bankruptcy protection in May 2017.

(k) Represents an adjustment to reflect pre-acquisition EBITDA of the Prior Acquisitions and removal of
pre-divestiture EBITDA of SRT to present the business on a normalized basis reflecting the impact of these
acquisitions and divestitures, in each case.

(l) Represents adjustments to eliminate (i) non-service cost components of the expense for the Company’s defined
benefit pension and post-retirement medical plans, such as interest costs and non-cash amortization of actuarial
gains and losses, and (ii) impact of non-cash swap agreements with third party infrastructure companies, which are
typically entered into to gain access to a portion of such third party’s fiber network.

(m) Represents adjustments to reflect (i) upfront cash receipts for indefeasible right of use contracts and qualifying
fulfilment revenue (such as installation revenue), net of upfront cash payments for installation costs, which are
received (paid) upfront but capitalized as deferred revenue (costs) and amortized over the life of the contract, and
(ii) cash receipts or cash payments for operating leases, which are capitalized as deferred rent and amortized over
the life of the lease. In each case, the non-cash revenues and expenses are reversed and replaced with the actual
cash receipts and payments during the period, except that, with respect to the adjustment described in clause (i) of
the preceding sentence, the adjustments for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 and the three
months ended December 31, 2019 are based on the average quarterly cash receipts and payments during the prior
four fiscal quarters, which we believe is a more accurate presentation of our normalized recognition of these cash
receipts and payments.

(n) Represents the estimated cost savings on a run-rate basis, including headcount reductions, expiration or expected
subletting of real estate leases within the Allstream segment and other general administrative and network
optimization savings. We expect to implement these initiatives within twelve months of the consummation of the
Merger. We cannot assure you that any or all of these cost savings will be achieved in the anticipated amounts or
within the anticipated timeframes or at all. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may not
realize expected structural cost savings because of challenges and other unanticipated difficulties in optimizing our
cost structure.’’

(o) Represents the (i) run-rate impact of MRR for the month ended December 31, 2019 (as if such MRR was the
same for each of the three months ended December 31, 2019), (ii) run-rate impact of uninstalled bookings, such
that bookings not yet installed as of December 31, 2019 (and excluded from MRR) are reflected in MRR and
(iii) reduction in MRR as a result of known churn events as of December 31, 2019. For each of the adjustments in
the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the adjustment is reflected net of estimated costs associated with these
contracts.

(6) Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue is defined as revenue plus non-recurring reserve releases, impact of fiber swap agreements,
other cash considerations, and run-rate new bookings, net of known churn.

Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, and is not presented
in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue may be useful for potential purchasers of the
notes in assessing our operating performance. The items excluded from Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue are significant in
assessing our operating results. Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not
consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue

includes the run-rate impact for the periods presented of the MRR attributable to contracts signed during or after such
period, as if such MRR had been received by the Company as of the first day of such period, net of MRR attributable to
contracts that were cancelled or terminated or for which the Company has received notice of cancellation or termination.
Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue does not reflect the historical revenue for such period and you should not view Pro Forma
Adjusted Revenue to be projections of revenue in any future period. See ‘‘Non-GAAP Financial Measures.’’

(b) Represents the impact of non-cash swap agreements with other infrastructure companies, which are typically
entered into to gain access to a portion of such third party’s fiber network.

(c) Represents adjustments to reflect (i) upfront cash receipts for indefeasible right of use contracts and qualifying
fulfilment revenue (such as installation revenue) which are received upfront but capitalized as deferred revenue
and amortized over the life of the contract, and (ii) cash receipts for operating leases, which are capitalized as
deferred rent and amortized over the life of the lease. In each case, the non-cash revenues are reversed and
replaced with the actual cash receipts during the period, except that, with respect to the adjustment described in
clause (i) of the preceding sentence, the adjustment is based on the average quarterly cash receipts during the
prior four fiscal quarters, which we believe is a more accurate presentation of our normalized recognition of these
cash receipts.

(d) Represents the (i) run-rate impact of MRR for the month ended December 31, 2019 (as if such MRR was the
same for each of the three months ended December 31, 2019), (ii) run-rate impact of uninstalled bookings, such
that bookings not yet installed as of December 31, 2019 (and excluded from MRR) are reflected in MRR and
(iii) reduction in MRR as a result of known churn events as of December 31, 2019.

(7) Total cash interest expense after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions is calculated using an assumed weighted
average interest rate of 5.95% on the notes offered hereby and on the approximately $5,060.0 million in borrowings
expected to be made under the New Term Loan Facilities as of the closing of the Transactions. Estimated interest rates are
based on assumptions of the rates to be effective upon the closing of the Transactions. A 0.125% change in the assumed
weighted average interest rate would increase/decrease total cash interest expense after giving pro forma effect to the
Transactions by $10.1 million. Additionally, a $100 million increase or decrease in the amount of debt incurred to finance
the Transactions (without a change in assumed interest rates) would increase or decrease, respectively, interest expense by
$6.0 million per year and $1.5 million per quarter. See ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information.’’

(8) Total secured net debt represents total net debt that is secured, which comprises debt under the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and the secured notes, and is effectively senior to the unsecured notes to the extent of the value of the Collateral
securing such indebtedness, less cash and cash equivalents.

(9) Total net debt represents total debt (excluding finance lease obligations) less cash and cash equivalents.

(10) Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA is determined by multiplying Further Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended
December 31, 2019 by four. Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings is determined by
multiplying Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net bookings for the three months ended December 31, 2019 by
four.

(11) The ratio of Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA to total cash interest expense is determined by dividing Annualized
Further Adjusted EBITDA by total cash interest expense. The ratio of Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA including
run-rate net bookings to total cash interest expense is determined by dividing Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA
including run-rate net bookings by total cash interest expense.

(12) The ratio of total secured net debt to Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA is determined by dividing total secured net
debt by Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA. The ratio of total secured net debt to Annualized Further Adjusted
EBITDA including run-rate net bookings is determined by dividing total secured net debt by Annualized Further Adjusted
EBITDA including run-rate net bookings.

(13) The ratio of total net debt to Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA is determined by dividing total net debt by Annualized
Further Adjusted EBITDA. The ratio of total net debt to Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net
bookings is determined by dividing total net debt by Annualized Further Adjusted EBITDA including run-rate net
bookings.

(14) Net new sales (‘‘bookings’’) represent the dollar amount of orders, to be recorded as MRR and MAR upon installation, in
a period that have been signed by the customer and accepted by our product offering delivery organization. The dollar
value of bookings is equal to the monthly recurring price the customer will pay for the offerings and/or the monthly
amortized amount of the revenue we will recognize for those offerings. To the extent a booking is cancelled by the
customer prior to the offerings being originated, it is subtracted from the total bookings number in the period that it is
cancelled. Bookings do not immediately impact revenue until the solutions are installed. Amounts exclude Allstream.

(15) Gross installed revenue represents the amount of MRR and MAR for offerings that have been installed, tested, accepted
by the customer, and recognized in revenue during a given period. Installs include new offerings, price increases and
upgrades. Net installations represents the net change to MRR and MAR and equals gross installed revenue less churn
processed. Amounts exclude Allstream.

(16) Churn is any negative change to MRR and MAR. Churn includes disconnects, negative price changes and disconnects
associated with upgrades or replacement offerings. Monthly churn is also presented as a percentage of MRR and MAR
(‘‘churn percentage’’). Amounts exclude Allstream.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Investing in the notes involves risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as_
_well as the other information included in and incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum,_
_including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ included in our_
_Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, before deciding to purchase any_
_notes. The risks described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not_
_currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also impair our business operations._
_Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of_
_operations and cash flows. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your investment in the notes._

**Risk Related to the Transactions**

**_We may not realize expected cost savings because of challenges and other unanticipated difficulties in_**
**_optimizing our cost structure._**

Our plan to optimize our cost structure and realize the anticipated cost savings described in this
offering memorandum comprises a number of initiatives, including, among other things, plans related
to headcount reduction, expiration or subletting of real estate leases within the Allstream segment and
general administrative and network optimization savings. We may not be able to accomplish all of these
initiatives, expense reductions or cost savings successfully, within the time frame we expect or at all.
Also, any unexpected diversion of management attention from the pursuit of these cost savings efforts
could prevent us from realizing the full expected cost savings. Our failure to achieve these cost savings
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The announcement and pendency of the Merger could adversely affect our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

The announcement and pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty
surrounding our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition. These risks to our business include the following: (i) the effect of restrictions placed
on us and our subsidiaries’ ability to operate our businesses under the Merger Agreement; (ii) the risk
of disruption resulting from the proposed transaction, including the diversion of our management’s
attention from ongoing business operations; (iii) the effect of the announcement of the proposed
transaction on our ability to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with our
customers, suppliers and others with whom we do business, or on our operating results and businesses
generally; and (iv) the effect of any legal proceedings instituted against us related to the Merger.

**_We expect to incur substantial expenses related to the completion of the Merger and post-Merger initiatives._**

We expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the Transactions and
post-Merger initiatives. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses related to
the Merger (including the Financing Transactions). We may incur additional costs to maintain employee
morale and to retain key employees. We will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating
post-Merger initiatives, and the execution of these initiatives may lead to additional unanticipated costs.
Unexpected delays in consummating the Merger or in connection with the post-Merger initiatives may
significantly increase the related costs and expenses incurred by us. These incremental transaction and
merger-related costs may exceed the savings we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative
costs and the realization of other anticipated cost savings, particularly in the near term and in the event
there are material unanticipated costs. We cannot identify the timing, nature and amount of all such
expenses as of the date of this offering memorandum. However, any such expenses could affect our
results of operations and cash flows from operations in the period in which such charges are recorded.

37


-----

**_Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could harm our business and result in substantial costs._**

We are involved in various claims, suits, investigations and legal proceedings that arise from time
to time in the ordinary course of business, as well as in connection with the Transactions. Additional
legal claims or regulatory matters may arise in the future and could involve stockholder, consumer,
regulatory, compliance, intellectual property, antitrust, tax and other issues on a global basis. Litigation
is inherently unpredictable. Regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation may be both
time-consuming and disruptive to our business. We could incur judgments or enter into settlements of
claims that could adversely affect our operating results or cash flows in a particular period. In addition,
we cannot be certain that our solutions do not or will not infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual
property rights of a third party, or that third parties will not assert infringement or violation claims
against us with respect to our current or future solutions. If any infringement or other intellectual
property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing
technology or license or otherwise obtain rights to use the proprietary rights on commercially
reasonable terms and conditions and on a timely basis, if at all, our business, operating results and
financial condition could be adversely affected.

**_Affiliates of the Investor Group will control us and their interests may conflict with our interests or the_**
**_interests of the holders of the notes in the future._**

Following the consummation of the Transactions, Zayo will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Holdings and Holdings will be a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of a parent company of which all or
substantially all of the issued and outstanding capital stock will be beneficially owned by certain funds
affiliated with the Investor Group. In addition, the Investor Group will have the right to designate all
of the members of our board of directors and the boards of directors and managers of our parent
companies. As a result, the Investor Group will have control over our decisions to enter into any
corporate transaction and will have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of
our board of directors or stockholders, regardless of whether the holders of notes believe that any such
transactions are in their own best interests. For example, the Investor Group could cause us to make
investments that increase the amount of our indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, or to sell
assets, which may impair our ability to make payments under the notes.

In addition, the Investor Group is in the business of making investments in companies and may,
from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us.
The Investor Group may vote in a manner so as to restrict us from expanding our business or entering
into additional lines of business that may be related to the current or future operations of these
investments. The Investor Group may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary
with our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as
the Investor Group continues to indirectly own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our
common stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, the Investor Group will continue to be able to
strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.

**_Our future results may differ, possibly materially, from the pro forma financial information presented in this_**
**_offering memorandum._**

Our future results following the consummation of the Transactions may be different, possibly
materially, from those shown in the ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information’’
section of this offering memorandum for several reasons. While the unaudited pro forma consolidated
financial information presented in this offering memorandum is based on assumptions regarding the
Transactions and other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, this
information is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to, and does not purport to, represent
what our actual results or financial condition would have been if the Transactions had been
consummated. These assumptions and estimates are only preliminary and will be updated only after the

38


-----

consummation of the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information
presented in this offering memorandum reflects the impact of the Merger on our historical financial
information using the acquisition method of accounting, as required under GAAP. Pursuant to the
acquisition method, we will record our tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of consideration transferred
(i.e., purchase price) over the fair value of net assets acquired will be recorded as goodwill.

Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if
circumstances indicate potential impairment. The final valuation of the tangible and identifiable
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed have not yet been completed. The completion of the
valuation upon consummation of the Merger could result in significantly different amortization
expenses and balance sheet classifications than those presented in the unaudited pro forma
consolidated financial information included in this offering memorandum. Additionally, we anticipate
incurring costs relating to cost savings initiatives, which have not been reflected in the unaudited pro
forma consolidated financial information presented in this offering memorandum. The Merger may also
give rise to unexpected liabilities and costs. Unexpected delays in consummating the Merger or in
connection with the post-Merger initiatives may significantly increase the related costs and expenses
incurred by us. If any of these circumstances were to occur, our operating expenses may be higher than
expected, reducing operating income and the expected benefits of the Merger. In addition, our actual
financing costs may be higher, and our revenues lower than those reflected in the unaudited pro forma
consolidated financial information. Higher financing costs and lower than expected revenues could
reduce our profitability and our ability to generate cash, and may reduce cost reduction and other
initiatives.

**_After the Merger is completed, we will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002._**

After the Merger is completed, because we will not register the notes under the Securities Act
after this offering, we will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires public
companies to have and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely
disclosure of material information, and have management review the effectiveness of those controls on
a quarterly basis. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires public companies to have and maintain
effective internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements, and have management review
the effectiveness of those controls on an annual basis (and have the independent auditor attest to the
effectiveness of such internal controls). We will not be required to comply with these requirements and
therefore we may not have comparable procedures in place as compared to other public companies.

**Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our_**
**_obligations under the notes._**

After giving effect to the Transactions, we will have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which
will require significant interest and principal payments. As of December 31, 2019, after giving pro
forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately $8,549.8 million in aggregate
principal amount of indebtedness, and estimated interest expense for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2019 would have been approximately $236.0 million. We would also have had unused
availability under the New Revolving Credit Facility of $750.0 million (without giving effect to
$8.8 million of outstanding letters of credit).

39


-----

Our and our subsidiaries’ substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences
to holders of the notes, including:

   - requiring us and certain of our subsidiaries to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
from operations to the payment of principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby
reducing the funds available for operations and any future business opportunities;

   - limiting flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in
which we operate;

  - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less
indebtedness;

   - increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;

   - making us and our subsidiaries more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings
under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates; and

   - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and increasing our cost of borrowing.

**_Our ability to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, depends on many factors beyond our_**
**_control, and if we cannot generate enough cash to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to take other_**
**_actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations with respect to our
debt, including the notes, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, are
subject to prevailing economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal and regulatory factors and other
factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating
activities sufficient to permit us to fund our day-to-day operations or to pay the principal, premium, if
any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes.

Cash flows from operations are the principal source of funding for us. Our business may not
generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. If our cash
flows are insufficient to service our indebtedness, including the notes, we may be forced to reduce or
delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our
indebtedness, including the notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the
condition of the capital and credit markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of
our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants,
which could further restrict our business operations and limit our financial flexibility. In addition, the
terms of existing or future debt agreements, including the credit agreement that will govern the New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures that will govern the notes, may restrict us from
adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal
on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit
rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may
not be successful and, as a result, our liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected and
we may not be able to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.

**_Despite our substantial level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries will be permitted to incur substantial_**
**_additional indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future.
Although the credit agreement that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
indentures that will govern the notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness,
these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness

40


-----

incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions do not
prevent us or our subsidiaries from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If we
incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes, the holders of that debt will be
entitled to share ratably with you in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency,
liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our company, subject to any collateral
arrangements. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you. In addition,
our New Revolving Credit Facility, which we do not currently intend to draw at the closing of the
Transactions, will provide for $750.0 million of additional secured debt capacity. Any borrowings under
the New Revolving Credit Facility, the borrowings under our New Term Loan Facilities and the secured
notes will be secured indebtedness and therefore will be effectively senior to the unsecured notes and
the related guarantees by the guarantors to the extent of the collateral securing such debt. To the
extent we and our subsidiaries incur further indebtedness, the substantial risks related to our level of
indebtedness would increase. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness,’’ ‘‘Description of Secured Notes’’
and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes.’’

**_We are dependent upon dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations._**

We are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Our ability
to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent on receipt of dividends from our direct and
indirect subsidiaries, certain of which will not be guarantors of the notes. Subject to the restrictions
contained in the indentures that will govern the notes and the credit agreement that will govern the
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, future borrowings and other agreements entered into by our
subsidiaries may contain restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to
us. In addition, federal and state corporate law and federal and state regulatory requirements may limit
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. We cannot assure you that the agreements of our
subsidiaries, applicable laws, or state regulation will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient
dividends, distributions or loans to fund payment of the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

**_Following the consummation of the Merger, the unsecured notes and the related guarantees will be effectively_**
**_subordinated to our and our guarantors’ indebtedness under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the_**
**_secured notes and any of our other secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that_**
**_indebtedness._**

Following the consummation of the Merger, the unsecured notes and the related guarantees will
not be secured by any of our or our subsidiaries’ assets and therefore will be effectively subordinated to
the claims of our secured debt holders to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. As of
December 31, 2019, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had
$6,247.5 million in secured debt and our New Revolving Credit Facility would have provided for unused
availability of $750.0 million (without giving effect to $8.8 million outstanding letters of credit), all of
which would have been effectively senior to the unsecured notes to the extent of the value of the
collateral securing such indebtedness. If we become insolvent or are liquidated, or if payment under the
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the secured notes is accelerated, the lenders under the New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the holders of the secured notes, as applicable, will be entitled to
exercise the remedies available to a secured lender under applicable law (in addition to any remedies
that may be available under documents pertaining to the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the
secured notes, as applicable). For example, if a secured lender forecloses upon and sells the pledged
equity interests of any guarantor, that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the unsecured
notes automatically and immediately upon such sale. In that event, because the unsecured notes will
not be secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in the guarantors, it is possible that there
could be no assets remaining from which the claims of the holders of unsecured notes could be
satisfied or, if any assets remained, they might be insufficient to satisfy claims of the holders of
unsecured notes in full. In addition, we and/or the guarantors may incur additional senior secured

41


-----

indebtedness, the holders of which will also be entitled to the remedies available to a secured lender.
See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes.’’

**_Our debt agreements contain restrictions that could limit our flexibility in operating our business._**

The operating and financial covenants and restrictions in the credit agreement that will govern the
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indentures that will govern the notes and other debt that we
incur in the future may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or
engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. The agreements governing our
indebtedness will restrict, subject to certain important exceptions and qualifications, our and our
subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:

  - incur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness;

   - pay dividends or make distributions or make certain other restricted payments;

  - make certain investments;

   - create liens on our or our guarantors’ assets;

   - sell or otherwise dispose of assets;

   - enter into transactions with affiliates;

   - enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

   - designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and

   - enter into mergers or consolidations or sell all or substantially all of our or our restricted
subsidiaries’ assets.

A breach of the covenants or restrictions under the indentures that will govern the notes or under
the credit agreement that will govern our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities could result in an event
of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the
related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or crossdefault provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the credit agreement that will govern
our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities would permit the lenders under our New Revolving Credit
Facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we
were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the
event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries
may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:

  - limited in how we conduct our business;

   - unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or
business downturns; or

   - unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.

These restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our
financial results, our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the
availability and terms of our financing.

**_The terms of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities have not been finalized._**

The credit agreement relating to the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities has not been finalized.
The Issuer’s ability to successfully syndicate the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities is subject to
market conditions, and the Issuer cannot assure you that the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will

42


-----

be successfully syndicated on the terms described herein. Future changes in market conditions may
result in changes to the terms of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including pricing, that are
less favorable to the Issuer and may increase the Issuer’s interest expense and adversely affect the
Issuer’s business. The terms of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities could also change in a way
that increases the Issuer’s indebtedness or makes it easier to incur debt in the future.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations_**
**_to increase significantly._**

Borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and
expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the
variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and
our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will
correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2019, after giving effect to the Transactions,
approximately $5,060.0 million of our debt would have been variable rate debt, and holding other
variables constant, we estimate that an increase or decrease in interest rates by 0.25% (25 basis points)
on our variable rate debt would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately
$12.7 million. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating
for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not
maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we
enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.

**_The notes and the note guarantees are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our non-guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries._**

The notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our
non-guarantor subsidiaries. The indentures that will govern the notes will allow any non-guarantor
subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness in the future and will not limit the incurrence of
liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. Any right that the Issuer or the guarantors have to
receive any assets of any non-guarantor subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of those
subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of holders of the notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any
of those subsidiaries’ assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of those non-guarantor
subsidiaries’ creditors, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests of those
subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of any non-guarantor subsidiaries,
holders of their debt, including their trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding
indebtedness or guarantees issued by those subsidiaries, are generally entitled to payment on their
claims from assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to us.

As of December 31, 2019, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our
non-guarantor subsidiaries would not have had any indebtedness (excluding intercompany liabilities).
On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would have
accounted for approximately $517.5 million, or 20.0%, of our consolidated total revenue, approximately
$82.5 million, or 25.8%, of our consolidated operating income, and approximately $190.2 million, or
14.8%, of our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, in each case for the twelve months ended December 31,
2019. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $1,487.7 million, or 14.9%, of our
consolidated total assets, and approximately $836.8 million, or 9.9%, of our consolidated total liabilities,
in each case as of December 31, 2019. In addition, Zayo Group Latin America, LLC, a guarantor
under our Existing Notes, is not expected to guarantee the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or
notes offered hereby. As of December 31, 2019, Zayo Group Latin America, LLC had no revenue,
EBITDA, operating income or net income and had insignificant assets and liabilities.

43


-----

**_The lenders under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will have the discretion to release guarantors_**
**_under such facility in a variety of circumstances, which will cause those guarantors to be released from their_**
**_guarantees of each series of notes and the liens on the assets of such guarantor in favor of the holders of the_**
**_secured notes offered hereby to automatically be released._**

So long as any obligations under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities remain outstanding, any
guarantee of the notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of notes or the
trustee under the indentures governing the notes if, at the discretion of lenders under our New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, the related guarantor is no longer a guarantor of obligations under our New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The lenders under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will have
the discretion to release the guarantees under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities in a variety of
circumstances. Any of our subsidiaries that are released as guarantors of our New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities will automatically be released as guarantors of the notes, subject to limited exceptions.
You will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the notes,
and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of
those subsidiaries will effectively be senior to your claims as a holder of the notes. In addition, the liens
on the assets of any such subsidiary that is released as a guarantor will automatically be released
without the consent of any holder of the secured notes or the applicable trustee.

**_Prior to or when the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities mature, we may not be able to refinance or replace_**
**_them._**

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities have earlier maturity dates than the notes. Prior to or
when the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities mature, we may need to refinance them and may not be
able to do so on favorable terms or at all. If we are able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the terms
of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict our
financial and operating flexibility. If we are unable to refinance the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities prior to or when they mature, it could result in an event of default under the credit
agreement that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Moreover, the occurrence of an
event of default under the credit agreement that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities
could result in an event of default under our other indebtedness, including the indentures that will
govern the notes.

**_Prior to or when the secured notes mature, we may not be able to refinance or replace them._**

The secured notes have an earlier maturity date than the unsecured notes. Prior to or on the
secured notes maturity date, we may need to refinance them and may not be able to do so on favorable
terms or at all. If we are able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the terms of any refinancing or
alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict our financial and operating
flexibility. If we are unable to refinance the secured notes prior to or when they mature it could result
in an event of default under the indenture that will govern the secured notes. Moreover, the occurrence
of an event of default under the indenture that will govern the secured notes could result in an event
of default under our other indebtedness, including the indenture that will govern the unsecured notes.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control, which would result in a default under_**
**_the indentures that will govern the notes and would materially adversely affect our business and financial_**
**_condition._**

Upon a change of control as described under ‘‘Description of Secured Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of
Unsecured Notes,’’ we are required to make an offer to repurchase all of the notes of each series then
outstanding at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
purchase. Additionally, under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, a change of control (as defined
therein) constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of

44


-----

borrowings under the respective agreements and terminate their commitments to lend. The source of
funds for any repurchase of the notes and repayment of borrowings under our New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities would be our available cash or cash generated from our and our subsidiaries’
operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds provided by
our existing or new stockholders. We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control
because we may not have sufficient financial resources to repurchase all of the debt securities that are
tendered upon a change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due. If we fail to
repurchase the applicable series of notes in that circumstance, we will be in default under the indenture
that will govern such series of notes. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund
any such repurchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further,
our ability to repurchase the notes may be limited by law. In addition, certain corporate events, such as
leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a
‘‘change of control’’ under the indentures even though those corporate events could increase the level
of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the
notes. See ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control’’
and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.’’

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults taken under the indenture governing each series of notes by beneficial_**
**_owners with short positions in excess of their interests in such series will be disregarded._**

By acceptance of each series of notes, each holder of such series (other than screened affiliates)
agrees, in connection with any notice of default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the trustee to
provide a notice of default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a ‘‘Noteholder Direction’’),
to (i) deliver a written representation to the Issuer and the trustee that such holder and any of its
affiliates acting in concert with it in connection with its investment in such series (other than screened
affiliates) are not (or, in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that such holder is being
instructed solely by beneficial owners that (together with such affiliates) are not) Net Short (as defined
under ‘‘Description of Secured Notes’’ or ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes,’’ as applicable) and
(ii) provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to
time in order to verify the accuracy of such holder’s representation within five business days of request
therefor. Holders of the notes, including holders that have hedged their exposure to the notes in the
ordinary course and not for speculative purposes, may not be able to make such representations or
provide the requested additional information. These restrictions may impact a holder’s ability to
participate in Noteholder Directions if it is unable to make such a representation.

**_The ability of holders of notes to require us to repurchase notes as a result of a disposition of ‘‘substantially_**
**_all’’ of our assets is uncertain._**

The definition of change of control in the indentures that will govern the notes will include a
phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of ‘‘all or
substantially all’’ of our and our restricted subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a whole. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established
definition of the phrase. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require us to repurchase such
notes as a result of a sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of our and our
subsidiaries’ assets taken as a whole to another person or group is uncertain.

**_Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and/or the note guarantees_**
**_and the liens securing the secured notes and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes,_**
**_the guarantees and the liens securing the secured notes and the related guarantees and/or require holders of_**
**_the notes to return payments received from us in respect of the notes and the guarantees and, if that occurs,_**
**_you may not receive any payments on the notes._**

Our creditors and the creditors of the guarantors of the notes could challenge the issuance of the
notes or the guarantors’ issuance of their note guarantees, respectively, and, in the case of the secured
notes and the related guarantees, the grant of liens by us and the guarantors, as fraudulent conveyances
or on other grounds. Under U.S. bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer
laws, a court could void the issuance of the notes and/or a note guarantee or claims related to the
notes, subordinate a note guarantee to all of our other debts or to all other debts of a guarantor or, in
the case of the secured notes and the related guarantees, void the granting of liens to secure the
secured notes or the related guarantees. if, among other things, we or a guarantor, at the time we or
such guarantor incurred the indebtedness:

   - intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; or

   - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the delivery of the notes
or the guarantee or, in the case of the secured notes and the related guarantees, the granting of
liens, as the case may be, and if the Issuer or guarantor:

     - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

     - was engaged in a business or transaction for which the Issuer’s or the guarantor’s remaining
assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or

     - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts
as they mature.

In addition, a court could void any payment by a guarantor pursuant to the notes or a note
guarantee and require that payment be returned to such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the
creditors of the guarantor. If the notes or note guarantees were avoided or limited under fraudulent
transfer or other laws, any claim you may make against the Issuer or the guarantors for amounts
payable on the notes would be unenforceable to the extent of such avoidance or limitation. If the liens
granted to secure the secured notes or the related guarantees were avoided or limited under fraudulent
transfer or other laws, the holders of the secured notes would cease to have a secured claim against the
Issuer or the guarantors. Moreover, the court could order you to return any payments previously made
by the Issuer or the guarantors.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the
governing law in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally,
however, a party would be considered insolvent if:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of
all of its assets;

   - the present fair saleable value of all of its assets was less than the amount that would be
required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they
become absolute and mature; or

   - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

We cannot be certain what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or,
regardless of the standard, that a court would not avoid the notes or note guarantees or the liens
granted to secure the secured notes and the related guarantees.

46


-----

The indentures that will govern the notes will contain a ‘‘savings clause’’ intended to limit each
guarantor’s liability under its guarantee to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the
guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer under applicable law. There can be no assurance that this
provision will be upheld as intended. In a Florida bankruptcy case (which was reinstated by the United
States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in 2012 on other grounds), this type of provision was
found to be ineffective to protect guarantors.

**_Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the_**
**_notes under applicable securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer and resell the notes_**
**_without registration under applicable securities laws._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and we do not currently intend to register the notes.
The holders of the notes will not be entitled to require us to register the notes for resale or otherwise.
Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a transaction registered
under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities
laws. You may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. See
‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

**_Many of the covenants in the indentures that will govern the notes will be suspended with respect to a_**
**_particular series of notes if such series of notes has investment grade ratings from any two of Moody’s, S&P_**
**_and Fitch._**

Many of the covenants in the indentures that will govern the notes will be suspended with respect
to a particular series of notes if such series of notes has investment grade ratings from any two of
Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, provided that at the time of suspension no default has occurred and is
continuing. Although there can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade, or if
they are rated investment grade, that the notes will maintain those ratings, any suspension of the
covenants under the indentures that will govern the notes would allow us to engage in certain
transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in effect. To the extent any
suspended covenants are subsequently reinstated, any actions taken by us while the covenants were
suspended would not result in an event of default under the indentures that will govern the notes on
the basis that such actions would have been prohibited by the covenants. See ‘‘Description of Secured
Notes—Certain Covenants’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Certain Covenants.’’

**_Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active_**
**_trading market may not develop for the notes._**

Each series of notes will be a new issue of securities for which there is no established trading
market. We expect the notes to be eligible for trading by ‘‘qualified institutional buyers,’’ as defined
under Rule 144A, but we do not intend to list any series of notes on any national securities exchange
or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation system. The initial purchasers have
advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes, as permitted by applicable laws and
regulations; however, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the notes and, if
commenced, they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore,
an active market for the notes may not develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the
market price and liquidity of the notes. In such case, the holders of the notes may not be able to sell
their notes at a particular time or at a favorable price. If a trading market were to develop, future
trading prices of the notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors, including:

  - the number of holders of notes;

  - our operating performance and financial condition;

47


-----

   - the market for similar securities;

   - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes; and

   - prevailing interest rates.

Even if an active trading market for the notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will
continue.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the
notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in
that market or the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial
issuance, the notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing
interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors.

**_A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to the notes, if any, could_**
**_cause the liquidity or market value of the notes to decline._**

The notes have been rated by rating agencies. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell
or hold the notes. We cannot assure you that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of
time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating
agency’s judgment, circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our
business, so warrant. Any lowering or withdrawal of a rating by a rating agency could reduce the
liquidity or market value of the notes.

**_In the event that the Merger is not consummated on or before August 14, 2020, the Merger Agreement is_**
**_terminated at any time prior thereto, other conditions to the release of the escrowed proceeds of this offering_**
**_are not satisfied or the terms of the escrow agreement are not otherwise complied with, the notes will be_**
**_subject to a special mandatory redemption, and as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect on the_**
**_notes._**

If the Merger is not consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering,
concurrently with the closing of this offering, Merger Sub will enter into an escrow agreement, pursuant
to which the initial purchasers will deposit an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of each series
of notes offered hereby into a separate segregated escrow account for the applicable series of notes
until the date that the conditions to release the property in such escrow account are satisfied or such
series of notes is otherwise required to be redeemed pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement.
The escrowed funds will be initially limited to the gross proceeds from the offering and will not be
sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Amount, which includes accrued and unpaid
interest up to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. Unless the Merger is
consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering, on the closing date of this
offering, one or more funds or limited partnerships managed or advised by affiliates of the Investor
Group will execute a commitment letter pursuant to which they will commit to fund, upon the
occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption, any amounts owed to holders of each series of notes
on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date in excess of the amount contained in the applicable
escrow account on such date. However, we cannot assure you that such funds or partnerships will have
sufficient funds necessary to pay any shortfall required to fund a Special Mandatory Redemption. In
addition, your decision to invest in the notes will be made prior to the consummation of the Merger
and completion of certain closing conditions stated in the Merger Agreement, and consequently you
will not be afforded protection with respect to any adverse changes in the business or financial
condition of Zayo following the closing of this offering.

48


-----

If, among other things, the Merger is not consummated by the Outside Date, Merger Sub will be
required to redeem all of the notes of each series on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date in
accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture that will govern such series of notes at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such series of notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. See ‘‘Description of
Secured Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Special
Mandatory Redemption.’’

Upon such redemption, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an
investment that yields comparable returns. Additionally, you may suffer a loss on your investment if you
purchase the notes at a price greater than the issue price of such notes. See ‘‘Description of Secured
Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Special Mandatory
Redemption.’’ Although the trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the applicable series of notes, will
be granted a first-priority lien on the funds deposited in the applicable escrow account, the ability of
holders of the notes of such series to realize upon such funds may be subject to certain bankruptcy law
limitations in the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer.

**_Until the consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will have limited assets and Zayo and its restricted_**
**_subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants in the indentures governing the notes._**

Holders of the notes will not have any recourse to Zayo or its subsidiaries prior to the
consummation of the Merger. Until the completion of the Merger, the notes will be the obligation only
of Merger Sub, as issuer, and will not be guaranteed by Zayo or any of its subsidiaries. Merger Sub will
have limited assets and no significant independent operations until such time, and as a result, the sole
recourse of the holders of notes of any series prior to the consummation of the Merger will be to the
funds deposited in the segregated escrow account for such series of notes. Prior to the release of the
funds in such escrow account in accordance with the provisions of the escrow agreement, Zayo and its
restricted subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the covenants set forth in the indentures governing
the notes.

**_If a bankruptcy or reorganization case is commenced, bankruptcy laws may prevent the release of the_**
**_escrowed funds._**

If Merger Sub commences a bankruptcy or reorganization case, or one is commenced against
Merger Sub, while amounts remain in the applicable segregated escrow accounts for a series of notes as
described under ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and Description of
Unsecured Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ applicable bankruptcy laws may prevent the
escrow agent from releasing the funds in such segregated escrow account or applying those funds to
effect a Special Mandatory Redemption, as applicable, of such series of notes or otherwise applying
those funds for the benefit of the holders of such series of notes. The court adjudicating that case
might find that such segregated escrow account for the applicable series of notes is the property of the
bankruptcy estate, with or without restrictions on the use of such funds by the bankruptcy estate. As a
result, the holders of such series of notes could become unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate.
In addition, although the amounts in the segregated escrow account for the applicable series of notes
will be pledged as collateral for payment, if required, of the Special Mandatory Redemption Amount,
the automatic stay provisions of the federal bankruptcy laws generally prohibit secured creditors from
foreclosing upon or disposing of a debtor’s property without bankruptcy court approval (which may not
be given under the facts and circumstances of any particular case). As a result, holders of the
applicable series of notes may not be able to have the funds in the segregated escrow account for such
series of notes applied at the time or in the manner contemplated by the indenture governing such
series of notes and could suffer a loss.

-----

**_Between the time of the issuance of the notes and the consummation of the Merger, the parties to the Merger_**
**_Agreement may agree to modify or waive the terms or conditions of such document without the consent of the_**
**_holders of the notes._**

Prior to the consummation of the Merger, the parties to the Merger Agreement may agree to
amendments or waivers of the terms thereof. Such parties may make certain changes to the terms of
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or waive certain conditions to those
transactions, which could be material, without the consent of the holders of the notes.

**Risks Related to the Collateral for the Secured Notes**

**_In the event that this offering of notes is consummated prior to the completion of the Merger, security interests_**
**_over the Collateral will not be in place, and will not be perfected, on the date of issuance of the secured notes_**
**_and not all security interests over the Collateral may be in place at the time of the closing of the Merger._**

In the event that this offering of notes is consummated prior to the completion of the Merger,
then, pending the consummation of the Merger, the secured notes will not be secured by any assets
other than amounts deposited into the applicable escrow account. Therefore, the security interests in
the Collateral (other than amounts deposited into the applicable escrow account) will not be in place
and will not be perfected on the date of issuance of the secured notes. We expect that the majority of
security interests in the Collateral will be in place on the Effective Date. In the event of a bankruptcy
of the Issuer or any guarantor prior to the consummation of the Merger, holders of the secured notes
will only have a secured claim on the amounts in the applicable escrow account with respect to the
Issuer, as applicable, or the applicable guarantor. Any issues that we are not able to resolve in
connection with the delivery and recordation of such security interests in the Collateral at the time of
the consummation of the Merger may negatively impact the value of the Collateral. To the extent a
security interest in certain Collateral is not perfected on the Effective Date (on which date the
obligations under the secured notes will be assumed by Zayo and the guarantors), such security interest
might be voidable in bankruptcy, which could impact the value of the Collateral. See ‘‘—Any future
pledge of Collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy’’ below.

**_Sales of assets by the Issuer and the guarantors could reduce the Collateral and the related guarantees._**

The security documents that will relate to the secured notes will generally allow the Issuer and the
guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest
and dispose of any income from, the Collateral. Therefore, the pool of assets constituting the Collateral
will change from time to time, and its fair market value may decrease from its value on the date the
notes are originally issued. In addition, we are currently evaluating a disposition of our zColo business,
which would constitute a ‘‘Specified Asset Sale’’ under the terms of the indentures that will govern the
notes, and would not need to comply with certain restrictions on asset sales under such indentures. See
‘‘Description of Secured Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes’’ for more details and
‘‘Summary—Recent Developments—Ongoing Evaluation of zColo Business’’ for a description of the
potential disposition of our zColo business.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the secured notes and the related guarantees may not be sufficient to_**
**_satisfy our obligations under the secured notes._**

Prior to the Effective Date, obligations under the secured notes will be secured only by a firstpriority lien on the funds deposited in the applicable escrow account, which escrowed funds will initially
be limited to the gross proceeds from the offering of the secured notes and, as a result, will not be
sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Amount in respect of the secured notes, which
includes accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption
Date. Following the Effective Date, obligations under the secured notes will be secured, together with

50


-----

the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, by first-priority liens on the Collateral (subject to other prior
ranking liens permitted by the indenture that will govern the secured notes). No appraisal of the value
of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering of the secured notes, and the fair
market value of the Collateral will be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among
others, changing economic conditions, competition and other future trends. By its nature, some or all
of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a
foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the lenders under the New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, the holders of the secured notes and the holders of any other pari passu first lien
indebtedness will be entitled to be repaid in full from the proceeds of the Collateral before any
payment is made in respect of any other indebtedness that is secured by a junior lien on such
Collateral or that is unsecured (including the unsecured notes).

Moreover, the lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the holders of any other
indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral will share the proceeds of the Collateral
ratably with the holders of the secured notes, thereby diluting the Collateral coverage available to
holders of the secured notes. As a result, the fair market value of the Collateral may not be sufficient
to repay the holders of the secured notes upon any foreclosure, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization,
bankruptcy or similar proceeding. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral will be saleable,
and even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be uncertain. Accordingly, the Collateral may
not be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the
Collateral may not be sufficient to pay all or any of the amounts due on the secured notes. Any claim
for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the secured notes from the sale of
the Collateral and the obligations under the secured notes will rank equally in right of payment with all
of the Issuer’s unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness (including, without limitation, the unsecured
notes) and other obligations, including trade payables. In addition, as discussed further below, the
holders of the secured notes would not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees,
costs, expenses or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the secured notes
exceeded the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other debt secured by first-priority
liens on the Collateral, including the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities), or any ‘‘adequate
protection’’ on account of any undersecured portion of the secured notes. See ‘‘—In the event of a
bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the guarantors, the holders of the secured notes may be deemed to
have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the secured notes
exceed the fair market value of the Collateral securing the secured notes and the related guarantees.’’

All of the indebtedness under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be secured by the
Collateral on a first-priority lien basis and will be entitled to payment out of the proceeds of any sale
of the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the holders of the secured notes. Under the terms of the
indenture that will govern the secured notes, the Issuer will be permitted to incur additional secured
indebtedness in excess of the current commitments under New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.
Although the credit agreement that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
indentures that will govern the notes will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional secured
indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the
indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. For example, the
Issuer and the guarantors will be permitted to incur debt secured by certain prior ranking liens, such as
finance lease obligations, that will rank effectively senior to the liens securing the secured notes with
respect to the assets that are subject thereto. Any such secured indebtedness may further dilute the
collateral coverage and limit the recovery from the realization of the Collateral available to satisfy
holders of the secured notes. See ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Liens’’ and
‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Certain Covenants—Liens.’’

51


-----

**_Even though the holders of the secured notes will benefit from a first-priority lien on the Collateral, the_**
**_collateral agent under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will initially control actions with respect to_**
**_that Collateral pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement._**

The rights of the holders of the secured notes with respect to the Collateral that will secure the
secured notes on a first-priority basis will be subject to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement
among all holders of obligations secured by that Collateral on a first-priority basis, including the
obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to such Collateral, including the ability to cause
the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such Collateral and to control such
proceedings, will be at the exclusive direction of the collateral agent for the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities until the earlier of (1) the date on which the Issuer’s obligations under the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities (or any refinancing indebtedness in respect thereof) are no longer secured or
(2) 90 days after the occurrence of an event of default under any agreement governing debt secured by
a first-priority lien on the Collateral other than the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities (including the
indenture that will govern the secured notes) that is continuing, if the holders of such debt represent
the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the
Collateral (excluding the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities), the authorized representative of such
holders has complied with the applicable notice provisions and the collateral agent under the New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities has not commenced the exercise of remedies with respect to the
Collateral.

At any time that the collateral agent under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities does not have
the right to direct the actions with respect to the Collateral pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement, the right to direct such actions will pass to the authorized representative of holders of the
then largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the
Collateral. If we have, at such time, outstanding indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral on a pari
_passu basis with the secured notes and has a greater outstanding principal amount than the outstanding_
aggregate principal amount of the secured notes, then the authorized representative for such
indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement,
rather than the Notes Collateral Agent. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may never have the
right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the Collateral.

Also, under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the
secured notes obtain possession of any Collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any
Collateral at any time prior to the discharge of each of the other first-priority obligations, then such
holders will be obligated to hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of
first-priority obligations and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may
be, to the controlling collateral agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Equal
Priority Intercreditor Agreement among all the holders of first-priority obligations. Thus, the holders of
the secured notes may be obligated to turn over to the other holders of the first-priority obligations any
Collateral, proceeds or payments they may receive.

**_Pledges of equity interests of foreign subsidiaries of the Issuer may not be valid and the liens may not be_**
**_enforceable for the repayment of the secured notes because such pledges may not be perfected pursuant to_**
**_foreign law pledge documents._**

Part of the Collateral securing the secured notes may consist of a pledge of up to 65% of the
voting stock of each direct foreign subsidiary of the Issuer or its domestic subsidiaries. Although such a
pledge of capital stock will be required to be granted under U.S. security documents, it may be
necessary or desirable to perfect such pledges under foreign law pledge documents. The Issuer will not
be required to provide such foreign law pledge documents. Unless and until such pledges of equity

52


-----

interests are properly perfected, they may not be valid and the liens may not be enforceable for the
repayment of the secured notes.

**_There may be restrictions or limitations on foreclosure._**

The Issuer’s obligations under the secured notes and the guarantors’ obligations under the related
guarantees are secured only by the Collateral described in this offering memorandum. The Notes
Collateral Agent’s ability to foreclose on the Collateral on behalf of the holders of the secured notes
may be subject to perfection and/or priority issues, state law requirements, applicable bankruptcy law,
and practical problems associated with the realization of the Notes Collateral Agent’s security interest
in or lien on the Collateral, including cure rights, foreclosing on the Collateral within the time periods
permitted by third parties or prescribed by laws, obtaining third-party consents, making additional
filings, statutory rights of redemption and the effect of the order of foreclosure. We cannot assure you
that the consents of any third parties and approvals by governmental entities or courts of competent
jurisdiction will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Therefore, we cannot
assure you that foreclosure on the Collateral will be sufficient to make all payments on the secured
notes.

**_State law may limit the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose on the real property and_**
**_improvements included in the Collateral._**

The secured notes will be secured by, among other things, liens on owned real property and
improvements located in several states. The laws of these states may limit the ability of the trustee and
the holders of the secured notes to foreclose on the improved real property Collateral located in that
state. Applicable state laws may impose procedural requirements for foreclosure that are different from
and that require a longer time period for completion than the requirements for foreclosure of security
interests in personal property. Debtors may have the right to reinstate defaulted debt (even if it is has
been accelerated) before the foreclosure date by paying the past due amounts and a right of
redemption after foreclosure. Governing laws may also impose security first and ‘‘one form of action’’
rules which can affect the ability to foreclose or the timing of foreclosure on real and personal property
Collateral regardless of the location of the Collateral and may limit the right to recover a deficiency
following a foreclosure.

The holders of the secured notes and the trustee also may be limited in their ability to enforce a
breach of the lien covenant that will be set forth in the indentures governing the notes and is described
under ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Liens.’’ Some decisions of state courts have
placed limits on a lender’s ability to accelerate debt secured by real property upon breach of covenants
prohibiting the creation of certain junior liens or leasehold estates, and a lender may need to
demonstrate that enforcement is reasonably necessary to protect against impairment of the lender’s
security or to protect against an increased risk of default. Although the foregoing court decisions may
have been preempted, at least in part, by certain federal laws, the scope of such preemption, if any, is
uncertain. Accordingly, a court could prevent the trustee and the holders of the secured notes from
declaring a default and accelerating the secured notes by reason of a breach of such covenant, which
could have a material adverse effect on the ability of holders of the secured notes to enforce the
covenant.

**_Rights of holders of the secured notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to create or_**
**_perfect the security interests._**

The Collateral securing the secured notes and the related guarantees will include substantially all
of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ tangible and intangible assets, whether now owned or acquired or
arising in the future. These assets will also secure the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ indebtedness under
the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain

53


-----

tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain
actions undertaken by the secured party. The security interests in the Collateral may not be perfected if
we are not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these security interests on or prior to
the Effective Date or thereafter. Our obligation to perfect the security interest for the benefit of the
holders of the secured notes in specified Collateral is limited. To the extent a security interest in certain
Collateral is not properly perfected on the Effective Date, such security interest might be avoidable in
bankruptcy, which could impact the value of the Collateral. See ‘‘—Any future pledge of Collateral or
guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.’’

If additional material wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and
become guarantors under the indenture that will govern the secured notes, additional financing
statements would be required to be filed to perfect the security interest in the assets of such
guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting after-acquired collateral, additional action
may be required to perfect the security interest in such assets. Applicable law requires that certain
property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can be perfected only at the
time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Neither the trustee nor the Notes Collateral
Agent will be responsible to monitor, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer will inform the
trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute
Collateral, or that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such
after-acquired collateral. Similarly, the collateral agent for the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will
have no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral
or the perfection of any security interests therein. Any failure to monitor may result in the loss of the
security interest in such Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the secured notes
and the guarantees against third parties. Even if the Notes Collateral Agent does properly perfect liens
on Collateral acquired or arising in the future, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference
in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances. See ‘‘—Any future pledge of Collateral or
guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.’’

**_Lien searches may not reveal all liens on the Collateral._**

We cannot guarantee that the lien searches on the Collateral that will secure the secured notes
and guarantees thereof will reveal any or all existing liens on such Collateral. Any such existing lien,
including undiscovered liens, could be significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the
secured notes and guarantees thereof and could have an adverse effect on the ability of the Notes
Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose upon the Collateral securing the secured notes and guarantees
thereof.

**_The Collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

We intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and
customary for our business. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not
economically insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our
losses. If there is a complete or partial loss or impairment in value of any of the Collateral, the
insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the secured obligations, including the secured
notes and the related guarantees.

**_The imposition of certain permitted liens will, under certain circumstances, permit the liens on the related_**
**_assets securing the secured notes and the related guarantees to be either subordinated to such permitted liens_**
**_or released. There are also certain other assets that are excluded from the Collateral._**

The indenture that will govern the secured notes will permit liens in favor of third parties to
secure additional debt, including purchase money indebtedness and finance lease obligations, and, in
the case of certain of such liens, the liens on the related assets securing the secured notes and the

54


-----

related guarantees may, under certain circumstances, be either subordinated to such permitted liens or
released. Our ability to incur additional debt and liens securing such additional debt in favor of third
parties is subject to limitations as described herein under the headings ‘‘Description of Secured Notes.’’
In addition, certain assets are excluded from the Collateral securing the secured notes and the related
guarantees, as discussed under ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Security for the Notes.’’ If an event of
default occurs and the maturity of the secured notes is accelerated, the secured notes and the related
guarantees will rank pari passu with the holders of other unsecured or senior indebtedness of the
relevant obligor with respect to such excluded assets. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as
security for the secured notes is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the secured notes,
those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of our unsecured creditors are paid.

**_Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy._**

Collateral pledged, or guarantees issued, after the Effective Date may be treated under bankruptcy
law as if they were pledged to secure, or delivered to guarantee, as applicable, previously existing
indebtedness. Any future pledge of Collateral or issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the
secured notes (including any pledge or guarantees provided after the Effective Date) or any future
issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the unsecured notes (including any guarantees
provided after the Effective Date) may be avoidable by the pledgor (as a debtor in possession),
guarantor (as a debtor in possession), by its trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by other creditors if
certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if (1) the pledgor or guarantor
is insolvent at the time of the pledge and/or issuance of the guarantee, (2) the pledge and/or issuance
of the guarantee (as applicable) permits the holders of the secured notes or the unsecured notes (as
applicable) to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 bankruptcy case than if such
pledge and/or guarantee (as applicable) had not been given and (3) a bankruptcy proceeding in respect
of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection thereof
and/or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a longer period.
Accordingly, if the Issuer or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the Effective
Date and any pledge of Collateral not pledged, or any guarantees not issued, on the Effective Date had
been pledged or perfected or issued (as applicable) less than 90 days before commencement of such
bankruptcy proceeding, such pledges or guarantees are materially more likely to be avoided as a
preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered on the Effective Date (even if the other
guarantees or liens (as applicable) issued on the Effective Date would no longer be subject to such
risk). To the extent that the grant of any such security interest and/or guarantee is avoided as a
preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the security interest and/or guarantee (as
applicable).

**_Rights of holders of the secured notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings._**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the Collateral
securing the secured notes and the related guarantees is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a
minimum delayed) by federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against
the Issuer or the guarantors that provide security for the secured notes or the related guarantees prior
to, or possibly even after, any collateral agent has repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Under
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the Notes Collateral Agent, is prohibited from
foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of
security previously repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not
be given under the circumstances). Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain
and use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents and profits of the collateral, even though the
debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given
‘‘adequate protection.’’ The meaning of the term ‘‘adequate protection’’ may vary according to the
circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in its

55


-----

collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and
at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral
as a result of the automatic stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the
debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured
creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the
collateral exceeds the amount of debt it secures. In view of both the lack of a precise definition of the
term ‘‘adequate protection’’ under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the broad discretionary powers of a
bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how, whether or when payments under the secured notes
could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case, the length of the delay in making
any such payments or whether any such payment will be made at all or in what form, whether or when
the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the
Collateral as of the commencement date of any bankruptcy proceedings, or whether or to what extent
or in what form holders of the secured notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss
of the value of the Collateral through the requirements of ‘‘adequate protection.’’

Furthermore, a bankruptcy court may decide to substantively consolidate us and some or all of our
subsidiaries in the bankruptcy proceeding. If a bankruptcy court substantively consolidated us and some
or all of our subsidiaries, the assets of each entity would become subject to the claims of creditors of
all entities. Such a ruling would expose holders of the secured notes not only to the usual impairments
arising from bankruptcy, but also to potential dilution of the amount ultimately recoverable because of
the larger creditor base. Furthermore, a forced restructuring of the secured notes could occur through
the ‘‘cramdown’’ provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Under those provisions, the secured notes
could be restructured over holders’ objections as to their interest rates, maturities and other general
terms.

Also, any disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy case outside of the ordinary course of
business would also require approval from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the
circumstances).

In addition, the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will impose certain limitations on the
ability of the holders of the secured notes to object to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing unless
the authorized agent for the lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities opposes or objects
thereto.

**_In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the guarantors, the holders of the secured notes may be_**
**_deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the secured notes_**
**_exceed the fair market value of the Collateral securing the secured notes and the related guarantees._**

In any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Issuer or any of the guarantors that have
guaranteed the secured notes, it is possible that the bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or
competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the Collateral on the date of the
bankruptcy filing was less than the then-current principal amount of the secured notes and all of our
other outstanding obligations secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral. Upon a finding by the
bankruptcy court that the secured notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy
proceeding with respect to the secured notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an
unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the
Collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the holders of the secured notes would be limited to
the value of the Collateral.

The consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack
of entitlement on the part of the holders of the secured notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, and
expenses and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the secured notes to receive
‘‘adequate protection’’ under federal bankruptcy laws, as discussed above. In addition, if any payments

56


-----

of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those
payments could be re-characterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of
the secured claim with respect to the secured notes.

**_There are circumstances, other than the repayment or discharge of the secured notes, under which the_**
**_Collateral and the related guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the_**
**_Notes Collateral Agent, and you may not realize any payment upon the release of such Collateral._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral and the related guarantees will be released
automatically, including:

   - upon a sale, transfer or other disposition of such Collateral in a transaction not prohibited under
the indenture that will govern the secured notes;

   - with respect to property and other assets of a guarantor of the secured notes that constitutes
Collateral, upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantee in accordance with the
indenture that will govern the secured notes;

   - with respect to Collateral that is capital stock, upon (i) the dissolution or liquidation of the
issuer of that capital stock that is not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the secured
notes or (ii) upon the designation of such issuer of capital stock as an unrestricted subsidiary
under the indenture that will govern the secured notes;

   - with respect to any Collateral that becomes an ‘‘Excluded Asset’’ (as defined in the ‘‘Description
of Secured Notes’’ section), upon it becoming an Excluded Asset;

   - to the extent the liens on the collateral securing the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are
released (other than any release by, or as a result of, payment of the obligations under the New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities), upon the release of such liens; and

   - in connection with any enforcement action taken by the controlling collateral agent in
accordance with the terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

Such release of the Collateral will not require the consent of holders of the secured notes or the
consent of the Notes Collateral Agent. The aggregate value of the Collateral that will secure the
secured notes will be reduced to the extent of the value of the released Collateral. The value of any
released Collateral could be significant and there can be no assurance that the value of the remaining
Collateral (if any) would be sufficient to satisfy all obligations owed by us to holders of the secured
notes and the holders of any additional secured indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the secured
notes with respect to such remaining Collateral, including the lenders under the New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities.

**_The security interests in the Collateral are not directly granted to the holders of the notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that secure our obligations under the secured notes and the
obligations of the guarantors under the related note guarantees are not granted directly to holders of
the secured notes but are granted only in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent on behalf of the holders
of the secured notes in accordance with the indenture that will govern the secured notes and the Equal
Priority Intercreditor Agreement. The holders of the secured notes will not have direct security
interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral, except through
the Notes Collateral Agent.

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**Merger**

On May 8, 2019, Zayo entered into the Merger Agreement with Holdings and Merger Sub.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Zayo, with Zayo surviving
the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings. Holdings and Merger Sub are affiliates of a
consortium led by the Investor Group and at the closing of the Transactions, Holdings will be indirectly
owned by the Investor Group. At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock of Zayo issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such shares (x) that are owned by
Zayo, any subsidiary of Zayo, Holdings, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect holding company of
Holdings immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) shares held by any of Zayo’s stockholders
who have properly demanded appraisal rights) will be automatically converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration of $35.00 per share in cash, without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes. None of the Company’s stockholders have elected to exercise their appraisal rights,
and such appraisal rights expired at the Company’s special meeting of stockholders held on July 26,
2019 where such stockholders approved the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and except as otherwise agreed between Holdings and a holder
of an RSU, as of the effective time of the Merger, each RSU outstanding immediately prior thereto
will be canceled and terminated and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Common Stock then subject to such RSU.

The Merger Agreement contains seller representations and warranties of the Company, buyer
representations and warranties of Holdings and Merger Sub and customary covenants and other
agreements among Holdings, Merger Sub and the Company. The closing of the Merger is conditioned
upon customary closing conditions, including the approval by Zayo’s stockholders (which was obtained
on July 26, 2019), the expiration or termination of the required waiting periods under the Hart-ScottRodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (which the Federal Trade Commission
granted on July 31, 2019), and other required regulatory approvals, including review and clearance by
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (which has been obtained), the receipt of
certain foreign antitrust approvals (which have been obtained), certain other foreign direct investment
review approvals (which have been obtained) and the approval of multiple U.S. states (all of which
have been obtained except for approval from the California public utility commission), and the receipt
of FCC approvals (which have been obtained). We expect to receive all remaining approvals in the first
calendar quarter of 2020, but cannot assure you that such approvals will be provided in a timely
manner or at all. The closing of the Merger is also conditioned upon the absence of any order or law
that is in effect that prohibits the Merger, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
parties, the compliance by the parties with their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement,
the delivery of certain closing documents and the absence of occurrences that would have, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect, as described in the Merger Agreement. The
Merger is expected to close during late first calendar quarter or early second calendar quarter of 2020,
but we cannot assure you that the Merger will close in a timely manner or at all.

Upon the consummation of the Merger, we will enter into certain arrangements with entities
affiliated with the Investor Group. Please refer to ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related Party
Transactions’’ for more information regarding these arrangements.

**The Financing Transactions**

In connection with the Merger, we expect to:

   - repay in full and terminate the Existing Term Loan Facilities, of which $1,755.5 million was
outstanding as of December 31, 2019;

58


-----

   - repay in full and terminate the Existing Revolver, of which $50.0 million was outstanding as of
December 31, 2019; and

   - repurchase any and all of the Existing Notes that are tendered in the Tender Offers.

We expect to finance the Merger, the Refinancing and pay the fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions (as defined below) with:

  - approximately $5,060.0 million of new senior secured term loans comprised of $4,235.0 million
under a new seven-year senior secured dollar term loan facility and A750.0 million under a new
seven-year senior secured euro term loan facility (approximately $825.0 million equivalent) under
the New Term Loan Facilities;

  - net cash proceeds from the issuance of $1,000.0 million aggregate principal amount of secured
notes and $2,080.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes, each offered hereby;

  - approximately $6,388 million of cash equity contributions from the Investor Group;

   - the contribution by certain members of management of Zayo of their existing equity interests in
Zayo; and

   - cash on hand at Zayo and its subsidiaries.

In addition, we expect to enter into a $750.0 million New Revolving Credit Facility.

For a more detailed description of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, see ‘‘Description of
Other Indebtedness,’’ and for a more detailed description of the notes, see ‘‘Description of Secured
Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes.’’

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The estimated sources and uses of the funds for the Transactions are shown in the table below,
assuming the Transactions occurred on December 31, 2019. Actual amounts at the closing of the
Transactions will vary from estimated amounts due to various factors, including, without limitation,
differences at closing in the amount of outstanding Company shares, unvested RSUs, the amount of
outstanding debt of the Company and accrued and unpaid interest, the amount of debt incurred by us
in connection with funding the Merger, our estimate of transaction-related fees and expenses, changes
in the Company’s working capital and cash and cash equivalents outstanding and changes made to the
sources of the contemplated financings.

If the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering, we
intend to use the proceeds from this offering, together with proceeds from initial borrowings under the
New Term Loan Facilities, certain equity contributions and cash on hand, to consummate the
Transactions as set forth below.

If the Merger is not consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering, the
gross proceeds of the notes will be funded into escrow and upon release of the funds from escrow, the
net proceeds of the notes will be used to fund a portion of the Transactions as set forth below. If,
among other things, the Merger is not consummated by the Outside Date, Merger Sub will be required
to redeem all of the notes of each series on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date in accordance
with the terms of the indenture that will govern such series of notes at a redemption price equal to
100% of the initial issue price of such series of notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not
including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. See ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Escrow Conditions,’’ ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Escrow
Conditions,’’ ‘‘Description of Secured Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of
Unsecured Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

You should read the following together with ‘‘The Transactions,’’ ‘‘Capitalization’’ and ‘‘Unaudited
Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information’’ and the related notes and ‘‘Description of Other
Indebtedness’’ included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(1) Represents expected cash at closing of the Transactions. As of December 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of
$181.3 million in cash and cash equivalents without giving effect to the Transactions. We expect that at the time of
the closing of the Transactions (prior to giving effect to the Transactions), our cash and cash equivalents will be
approximately $250 million. To the extent that our cash and cash equivalents balance at the time of the closing of
the Transactions is greater than $250 million, such additional cash and cash equivalents will increase the amount of
cash on our balance sheet following the closing of the Transactions. To the extent that our cash and cash equivalents
balance at the time of the closing of the Transactions is less than $250 million, the amount of cash on our balance
sheet following the closing of the Transactions will be reduced by the difference between the cash balance at closing
of the Transactions and $250 million.

(2) In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into (x) the New Term Loan Facilities, which we expect will
provide for a seven-year senior secured dollar term loan facility of $4,235.0 million and a seven-year senior secured
euro term loan facility of A750.0 million (approximately $825.0 million equivalent), and (y) the New Revolving

60


-----

Credit Facility, which we expect to provide for a five-year revolving facility of $750.0 million. We expect that the full
amount of the New Term Loan Facilities will be outstanding at the closing of the Transactions. The amount shown
excludes any original issue discount payable with respect to the term loans, which will be amortized and included as
interest expense in our statement of income and comprehensive income over the life of the term loans. We do not
currently intend to draw under the New Revolving Credit Facility at the closing of the Transactions, but may do so
as a result of a decline in cash on Zayo’s balance sheet on the closing date, to fund additional expenses or for other
general corporate purposes. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness.’’

(3) Represents the aggregate principal amount of notes offered hereby.

(4) Represents cash equity contributions expected to be made by the Investor Group and approximately $112 million of
rollover equity contributions expected to be made by certain members of management of Zayo.

(5) Reflects our estimate of the total consideration to be paid to holders of all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Common Stock that are entitled to receive the Merger Consideration and the settlement of RSUs in the Merger.

(6) Represents the total repurchase price for our Existing Notes pursuant to the Tender Offers, based on the aggregate
principal amounts of Existing Notes that have been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) as of the Early
Tender Deadline. Does not include $222.3 million aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes that were not
tendered as of the Early Tender Deadline. To the extent additional Existing Notes are validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn prior to the final expiration date of the Tender Offers, we expect to fund the repurchase of such
additional tendered Existing Notes with cash on our balance sheet and/or the net proceeds of the Financing
Transactions.

(7) As of December 31, 2019, we had (i) $486.2 million outstanding under our Existing Term Loan Facility due 2021,
(ii) $1,269.3 million outstanding under our Existing Term Loan Facility due 2024 and (iii) $50.0 million of
borrowings under the Existing Revolver. For a description of the Existing Credit Facilities, see ‘‘Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources’’ in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, which is incorporated by reference into this
offering memorandum. Depending on the timing of the closing of the Transactions, the borrowings and accrued
interest associated with the existing indebtedness may vary.

(8) Represents our estimate of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including financing fees, original
issue discounts, initial purchaser discounts, legal, advisory and professional fees and other transaction costs, such as
printing and rating agency fees. To the extent any financing fees, original issue discounts and other fees and
expenses exceed the estimated amounts, we expect to fund such amounts with cash on our balance sheet at the
closing of the Transactions.

may be, in cash and cash equivalents retained on the balance sheet after giving effect to the
Transactions.

(2) Any amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facilities at the closing of the Transactions will
be repaid in full, and the Existing Credit Facilities will be terminated at such time. An increase or
decrease in the amounts outstanding under our Existing Credit Facilities at the closing of the
Transactions, as compared to December 31, 2019, will result in corresponding decreases or
increases, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents retained on the balance sheet after giving
effect to the Transactions.

(3) Represents our estimate of the aggregate principal amount of our Existing Notes that will remain
outstanding following the Transactions, based on the aggregate principal amounts of Existing Notes

that have been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) as of the Early Tender Deadline. To
the extent additional Existing Notes are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the
final expiration date of the Tender Offers, we expect to fund the repurchase of such additional
tendered Existing Notes with cash on our balance sheet and/or the net proceeds of the Financing
Transactions.

(4) On the closing date of the Transactions, we will enter into the New Revolving Credit Facility,
which we expect will provide for a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility of
$750.0 million. We do not currently intend to draw under the New Revolving Credit Facility at the
closing of the Transactions, but may do so as a result of a decline in cash on Zayo’s balance sheet
on the closing date, to fund additional expenses or for other general corporate purposes. See
‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness.’’

(5) On the closing date of the Transactions, we will enter into the New Term Loan Facilities, which we
expect will provide for seven-year dollar and euro denominated senior secured term loans in an
aggregate amount of $5,060.0 million comprised of $4,235.0 of dollar denominated term loans and
approximately $825.0 million equivalent of euro denominated term loans. We expect that the full
amount of the New Term Loan Facilities will be outstanding at the closing of the Transactions. The
amount shown excludes any original issue discount payable with respect to the term loans, which
will be amortized and included as interest expense in our statement of income and comprehensive
income over the life of the term loans. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness.’’

(6) Reflects the aggregate principal amount of the secured notes offered hereby.

(7) Reflects the aggregate principal amount of the unsecured notes offered hereby.

(8) Eliminates the historical equity and reflects our new equity structure, which is comprised of the
estimated equity contribution to be made by the Investor Group and members of management of
Zayo as part of the Transactions, net of estimated transaction related costs recorded as expenses.

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

On May 8, 2019, Zayo, Holdings and Merger Sub, entered into the Merger Agreement to be
acquired by the Investor Group, comprising private equity funds including affiliates of EQT
Infrastructure IV, Digital Colony Partners, LP, DC Front Range Holdings I, LP and FMR LLC.
Following the consummation of the Merger, the Company will operate as a privately-held company.
Holdings and Merger Sub were formed by the Investor Group.

The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things, and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with
the Company surviving and continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Holdings, and (ii) at the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock of Zayo issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such shares (x) that are owned by
Zayo, any subsidiary of Zayo, Holdings, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect holding company of
Holdings immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) shares held by any of Zayo’s stockholders
who have properly demanded appraisal rights) will be automatically converted into the right to receive
$35.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data has been developed by applying pro
forma adjustments to our historical consolidated financial statements that are incorporated by reference
into this offering memorandum to reflect the effect of the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated statement of operations gives pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as
if they had occurred on July 1, 2018, and the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet data
gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on December 31, 2019. The unaudited pro
forma statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 has been derived by
adding the historical consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 to
the unaudited historical condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended
December 31, 2019, subtracting the unaudited historical condensed consolidated statement of
operations for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and then applying pro forma adjustments
related to the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations data for
the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 are included in this offering memorandum in
order to provide investors with the latest practicable three and twelve month periods available at the
time of this offering.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes
only and do not purport to represent what our financial condition or our results of operations would
have been had the Transactions occurred on the dates noted above or to project the results for any
future date or period. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information also does not
consider the impact of possible business model changes or any potential effects of changes in market
conditions on net revenues, expense efficiencies and asset dispositions, among other factors, including
those discussed under ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in this offering memorandum and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 incorporated by reference into this offering
memorandum. In addition, this pro forma presentation does not contemplate changes in tax structure,
accounting policies or synergy benefits. Therefore, actual results will differ from the pro forma
adjustments, and the differences may be material. The unaudited pro forma financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the information included under ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ ‘‘The Transactions,’’ ‘‘Use
of Proceeds,’’ ‘‘Capitalization,’’ ‘‘Selected Historical Financial Data’’ and our audited and unaudited
consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this offering
memorandum. The unaudited pro forma financial information, including the accompanying notes, has

been compiled from, and should be read in conjunction with, the following financial information in
accordance with GAAP:

  - the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three
and six months ended December 31, 2019, included in the Company’s Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 4, 2020; and

  - the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30,
2019, included in the Company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on
September 4, 2019.

All pro forma adjustments and their underlying assumptions are described more fully in the notes
accompanying the unaudited pro forma financial statements. The adjustments are limited to amounts
that are directly attributable to the Merger, factually supportable and, with respect to the unaudited
pro forma statements of operations, expected to have a continuing impact. The unaudited pro forma
adjustments reflected herein are preliminary and based upon available information and certain
assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.

**ZAYO GROUP HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES**
**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**1.** **Basis of Presentation**

The unaudited pro forma financial information is based on the historical consolidated financial
statements of the Company prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and reflects the pending Merger.
The historical financial information has been derived from the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Company for the year ended June 30, 2019, included in its Annual Report on
Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 4, 2019, and the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Company as of and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019,
included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 4, 2020. The unaudited
pro forma financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to
represent what our financial condition or our results of operations would have been had the
Transactions occurred on the dates noted below or to project the results of operations or financial
condition for any future date or period. The unaudited pro forma financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the information included under ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ ‘‘The Transactions,’’ ‘‘Use of
Proceeds,’’ ‘‘Capitalization,’’ ‘‘Selected Historical Financial Data’’ and our audited and unaudited
consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this offering
memorandum.

The unaudited pro forma financial information has been developed by applying pro forma
adjustments to our historical consolidated financial statements that are incorporated by reference into
this offering memorandum to reflect the effect of the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated statement of operations gives pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as
if they had occurred on July 1, 2018, and the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet data
gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on December 31, 2019. The unaudited pro
forma statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 has been derived by
adding the historical consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 to
the unaudited historical condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended
December 31, 2019, subtracting the unaudited historical condensed consolidated statement of
operations for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and then applying pro forma adjustments
related to the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma statement of operations data for the three and
twelve months ended December 31, 2019 is included in this offering memorandum in order to provide
investors with the latest practicable three and twelve month periods available at the time of this
offering. The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of
accounting under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business
Combinations, under GAAP. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated purchase
price of an acquisition is allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated
fair values. Such valuations are based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe
are reasonable. Management has made a preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase price to the
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on various preliminary estimates.
This estimate may differ materially from the actual allocation after the Merger. The actual adjustments
to our consolidated financial statements upon the closing of the Merger will depend on a number of
factors, including additional information available and our net assets on the closing date of the Merger.

The final purchase price allocation is dependent on, among other things, the completion of a
valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As of the date of this offering memorandum,
we have not completed the valuation studies necessary to finalize the estimates of the fair values of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related purchase price allocation. We have allocated the
total estimated purchase price, calculated as described in Note 4, to the assets and liabilities based on
preliminary estimates of their fair values, except for certain assets and liabilities that are presented at

their historical carrying value, which approximates fair value. A final determination of these fair values
will require a final valuation. This final valuation will be based on the actual net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets that exist as of the closing date of the Merger. Any final adjustment will
change the allocations of purchase price, which could affect the fair value assigned to the assets and
liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited pro forma financial statements, including a
change to goodwill and a change to the amortization of tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Any
such changes could differ materially from the valuations and purchase price allocations presented in the
accompanying unaudited pro forma financial statements. Revisions to the preliminary estimates of fair
market values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may have a significant impact on the pro forma
amounts of total assets, total liabilities and shareholders’ equity, depreciation and amortization expense,
interest expense and income tax expense.

The unaudited pro forma financial information also does not consider the impact of possible
business model changes or any potential effects of changes in market conditions on net revenues,
expense efficiencies and asset dispositions, among other factors, including those discussed under ‘‘Risk
Factors.’’ In addition, this pro forma presentation does not contemplate changes in tax structure,
accounting policies or synergy benefits. Therefore, actual results will differ from the pro forma
adjustments, and the differences may be material.

**2.** **Significant Non-recurring Items Included in the Historical Financial Statements**

**_Activities directly attributable to the pending Merger_**

The Company incurred transaction-related expenses directly attributable to the pending Merger of
$2.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019. The Company incurred transaction-related
expenses directly attributable to the pending Merger of $4.0 million and $1.0 million for the six months
ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company incurred transaction-related expenses
directly attributable to the pending Merger of $17.2 million and $14.2 million for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended June 30, 2019, respectively. All such transaction costs
have been excluded from the unaudited pro forma statements of operations as they are considered
non-recurring.

Stock-based compensation expense is included, based on the responsibilities of the awarded
recipient, in either our operating costs or selling, general and administrative expenses in our
consolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred charges of $27.0 million for the three
months ended December 31, 2019. The Company incurred charges of $54.2 million and $52.9 million
for the six months ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The Company incurred charges of
$110.6 million and $109.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended
June 30, 2019, respectively. The amount of stock-based awards is expected to decrease following the
Merger; however, the replacement compensation plan has not been determined and, at the time of this
offering, the Company is unable to estimate the impact of any replacement compensation plan.
Therefore, the unaudited pro forma financial statements do not reflect any adjustment pertaining to the
adoption of a replacement compensation plan.

The estimated interest expense, including the amortization of debt issuance costs, for each period
is shown below, assuming a weighted average interest of 5.95% on the notes offered hereby and on the
borrowings expected to be made under the New Term Loan Facilities to finance the Transactions:

Estimated annual interest expense . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 537.5
Less: Zayo’s historical interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 . . . . (339.2)

Interest expense adjustment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 . . . . . . . . . . . $ 198.3

Interest expense adjustment for the year ended June 30, 2019 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 198.8

Estimated six month interest expense . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 268.8

Interest expense adjustment for the six months ended December 31, 2019 . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 102.1

Less: Zayo’s historical interest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2018 . . . . . . . (166.2)

Interest expense adjustment for the six months ended December 31, 2018 . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 102.6

Estimated quarterly interest expense . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 134.4
Less: Zayo’s historical interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2019 . . . . . (82.0)

Interest expense adjustment for the three months ended December 31, 2019 . . . . . . . . . . . $ 52.4

The interest expense above was calculated using estimated interest rates. The actual term loans
incurred under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the notes offered hereby may reflect
interest rates that are higher or lower than the rates used and the impact on actual interest expense
could be material. Additionally, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma statements of operations and
pro forma balance sheet, the Company has assumed the term loans and the notes will be issued at par
value with no premium or discount. A change in interest rates of 0.125 percent would increase or
decrease total interest expense by approximately $10.1 million per year and $2.5 million per quarter.
Additionally, a $100 million increase or decrease in the amount of debt incurred to finance the
Transactions (without a change in assumed interest rates) would increase or decrease, respectively,
interest expense by $6.0 million per year and $1.5 million per quarter.

The fair value of all assets and liabilities is assumed to be the same as the historical book value
unless otherwise included in the notes below.

Zayo’s fair market value of debt assumed in the Merger represents the amount of cash required to
settle all existing debt obligations. In connection with the Merger, on January 17, 2020, Merger Sub
commenced cash tender offers for any and all of the outstanding 6.00% Senior Notes due 2023, 6.375%
Senior Notes due 2025 and 5.750% Senior Notes due 2027, each co-issued by Zayo’s wholly owned and
consolidated subsidiaries, Zayo Group, LLC and Zayo Capital, Inc. The early tender deadline for each
tender offer was 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 31, 2020. The final expiration date for each
tender offer is February 14, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated by Merger Sub. As of the Early
Tender Deadline, holders of $1,279,830,000 aggregate principal amount of Existing 2023 Notes,
$862,783,000 aggregate principal amount of Existing 2025 Notes and $1,615,115,000 aggregate principal
amount of Existing 2027 Notes had validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) their Existing Notes
and validly consented to the Proposed Amendments.

The existing revolver and term loans incurred by Zayo Group LLC do not have any prepayment
premium and are expected to be extinguished at their remaining principal outstanding, plus accrued

interest. In total, $72.6 million of accrued interest has been included in the fair market value of debt
assumed.

All restricted stock units (‘‘RSUs’’) granted prior to the Merger announcement date of May 8,
2019 vest upon the Merger’s closing. The cash paid for RSUs included in purchase consideration
represents the cash paid only for RSUs that accelerate upon closing of the Merger. This primarily
includes a portion of the Part B RSUs that were granted prior to May 8, 2019. Awards granted
subsequent to the Merger announcement, which include all Part A RSUs and the remaining Part B
RSUs, convert at closing of the Merger to deferred cash payments. See Note 4g—Stock Based
_Compensation for more information on the treatment of stock based compensation awards that do not_
accelerate upon the Merger’s closing.

**_(b) Property and equipment_**

The preliminary fair value of property and equipment was estimated by benchmarking Zayo’s
high-level network attributes (such as total fiber route miles and the ratio of aerial to underground
fiber) to recent comparable transactions. As such, the estimated fair value of property and equipment
included in these unaudited pro forma financial statements is preliminary and subject to change after
the Company finalizes its review of the specific types, nature, age and condition of property and
equipment. Once a final valuation has been completed, the fair value of property and equipment may
differ materially from the estimated fair value included in these unaudited pro forma financial
statements.

For purposes of calculating the remaining useful lives of assets, the Company has assumed assets
were approximately 50% through their useful life as of December 31, 2019. The preliminary fair value
and remaining estimated useful life of property and equipment are estimated as follows:

**Estimated** **Annual**

**_(c) Intangible assets_**

The preliminary fair value of identifiable intangible assets was estimated using high-level
assumptions regarding the Company’s revenue base, customer attrition rate and discount rate, and
benchmarked to other comparable transactions. As such, the estimated fair value of intangible assets
included in these unaudited pro forma financial statements is preliminary and subject to change after
the Company finalizes its review of specific customer relationships and other possible intangible assets.

Once a final valuation has been completed, the fair value of intangibles may differ materially from the

**_(e)_** **_Adjustments to deferred revenue_**

Based on the estimated fair value of deferred revenue, the following adjustments to revenue and
deferred revenue have been included in the unaudited pro forma statement of operations and pro
forma balance sheet:

**in millions**

Fair value of Zayo’s deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1,409.0

-----

Of the total adjustment to deferred revenue in the unaudited pro forma balance sheet, $1.9 million
of the deferred revenue adjustment has been classified as deferred revenue, current and the remaining
$23.5 million has been classified as deferred revenue, non-current.

**_(f)_** **_Adjustments to stockholders’ equity_**

As a result of the Merger, Zayo’s historical equity is eliminated, and the new equity contribution
from the Investor Group, as well as rollover equity from existing shareholders, of $6,500.0 million has
been included as additional paid in capital in the unaudited pro forma balance sheet.

**_(g) Stock-based compensation_**

All awards granted after the Merger announcement date of May 8, 2019 do not accelerate at the
time of closing of the Merger. This includes all Part A awards outstanding at the time of closing of the
Merger. As such, all unvested Part A RSUs outstanding at the time of closing of the Merger will
convert to deferred cash payments at a ratio of $35.00 per RSU. The deferred cash payments require
employees to complete the same amount of service as the original RSU awards. Therefore, a portion of
the fair value of the unvested RSUs has been attributed to pre-Merger services rendered and included
as an adjustment to accrued expenses in the unaudited pro forma balance sheet to reflect the future
cash payments associated with settling these awards.

As discussed in Note 4a- Preliminary purchase consideration and allocation, Part B RSUs granted
prior to May 8, 2019, and outstanding at the time of closing of the Merger, will accelerate and vest
upon closing of the Merger. Part B RSUs granted after May 8, 2019, and outstanding at the time of
closing of the Merger, will not accelerate. Instead these awards will convert to deferred cash payments
that include a change of control premium as set forth in the Merger Agreement. The deferred cash
payments associated with unvested Part B RSUs require employees to complete the same amount of
service as the original awards. Therefore, the fair value of the Part B RSUs that do not accelerate upon
closing of the Merger have been attributed to pre-Merger services rendered and included as an
adjustment to accrued expenses in the unaudited pro forma balance sheet.

Part A RSUs attributable to pre-Merger services . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,278,575
Fair value of one Part A RSU at Merger close . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 35.00

Fair value of Part A RSUs attributable to pre-Merger services (in millions) . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 44.8
Fair value of Part B RSUs attributable to pre-Merger services (in millions) . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 9.8

Total stock-based compensation attributable to pre-Merger services (in millions) . . . . . . . . $ 54.6

The portion of unvested Part A RSUs attributable to post-Merger services will be remeasured at
fair value upon closing of the Merger. This fair value will be amortized to the statements of operations
following completion of the Merger over the remaining service period of the awards. However, as the
remeasured fair value is not reflected in our historical statements of operations and the impact of the
remeasurement is non-recurring, the impact of the remeasurement has not been reflected in our
unaudited pro forma statement of operations.

As a result of the acceleration of Part B RSUs upon closing of the Merger, we expect our stock
compensation expense to decrease by approximately $0.9 million in the year following the close of the
Merger. We do not expect a material increase in fair value of the remaining unvested Part B awards

**_(h) Adjustments to income taxes_**

The current tax provision adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma statements of
operations were recorded by applying the U.S. blended statutory rate for federal and state tax of
26.09% to the net effect of adjustments made to the respective unaudited pro forma statement of
operations.

Fair value estimates for the deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the estimated purchase
price allocation adjustments and were recorded at the U.S. blended statutory rate for federal and state
tax. An analysis of the world-wide tax attribute impact due to the Merger has not been completed.
Once the final purchase price valuation and world-wide tax attribute assessments are complete, our
final purchase price adjustments may be materially different than presented in the unaudited pro forma
statements of operations and pro forma balance sheet. The table below outlines the purchase price
adjustments that impact our deferred tax balances:

of any such shares in which such individual does not have a pecuniary interest.

87

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Arrangements with the Investor Group and their Affiliates**

Merger Sub and certain subsidiaries or parent companies, including Holdings, have entered or
expect to enter into various related party agreements in the ordinary course of business and in

In the event of an initial public offering of a parent entity of Zayo, such parent entity is expected
to enter into a registration rights agreement with members of the Investor Group (the ‘‘Registration
Rights Agreement’’). The Registration Rights Agreement is expected to contain agreements among the

registration rights pursuant to which holders of equity of such parent entity will be entitled to certain

after the effective time of the Merger, in connection with such person’s service as one of our directors
or officers or as a director or officer of one of our subsidiaries.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

The following is a summary of what are expected to be the principal terms of the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, although these terms are still being negotiated and are subject to change. The
final terms of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities may differ from the terms described below.

**New Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

**_Overview_**

In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities
with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch (acting through such of its affiliates or branches as it
deems appropriate), as administrative agent and collateral agent, and certain other financial institutions
as agents and/or lenders.

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will provide for senior secured financing in an aggregate
principal amount of $5,810.0 million, consisting of the seven-year $5,060.0 million New Term Loan
Facilities and the five-year $750.0 million New Revolving Credit Facility.

Merger Sub will be the initial borrower under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and upon
the closing of the Transactions, shall be merged with and into Zayo, with Zayo surviving such merger as
the borrower (the ‘‘Borrower’’).

It is expected that the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will provide that we will have the right
at any time after the closing of the Transactions, subject to customary conditions, to request
incremental loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to (a) the greater of (i) $1,500.0 million and
(ii) 100% of Annualized EBITDA (as defined therein) of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries
plus (b) the amount of all voluntary prepayments and/or redemptions of, and debt buybacks made at a
discount to par of, the New Term Loan Facilities and additional indebtedness secured on a pari passu
basis with the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the amount of all voluntary permanent
commitment reductions under the New Revolving Credit Facility or under any incremental revolving
facilities prior to the date of any such incurrence (in each case to the extent not funded with the
proceeds of long term debt) plus (c) an additional unlimited amount so long as we do not exceed a
specified pro forma first lien net leverage ratio. The lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities will not be under any obligation to provide any such incremental loans, and any such addition
of or increase in loans will be subject to certain customary conditions precedent and other provisions.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Borrowings under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are expected to bear interest at a rate
per annum equal to an applicable margin, plus, at our option, either (x) in the case of borrowings in
U.S. dollars, (a) an adjusted base rate or (b) an adjusted LIBOR rate, or (y) in the case of borrowings
in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR rate, in each case, subject to interest rate floors. From and after the
delivery by the Borrower to the administrative agent of financial statements for the first full fiscal
quarter completed after the closing date of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the applicable
margins for the New Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to stepdowns based on our first lien net
leverage ratio.

**_Prepayments_**

It is expected that the New Term Loan Facilities will require us to prepay outstanding term loans,
subject to certain exceptions, with:

  - 50% of our annual excess cash flow, which percentage will be reduced to 25% and 0% of our
annual excess cash flow based upon the achievement of specified first lien net leverage ratios;

89


-----

   - 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of
property in excess of a certain amount, subject to reinvestment rights and other exceptions, with
stepdowns to 50% and 0% based upon the achievement of specified first lien net leverage ratios;
provided that if a disposition of the zColo business is consummated on or after the closing date
of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities but on or prior to the first anniversary of such
closing date, so long as a portion of the net cash proceeds thereof equal to at least
$495.0 million has been applied to prepay outstanding term loans or equal priority debt
(including the secured notes), we may repay certain other indebtedness, including the notes; and

  - 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain debt incurrences.

The foregoing mandatory prepayments will be applied to the scheduled installments of principal of
the New Term Loan Facilities and any incremental term loan facilities incurred under the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities on a pro rata basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not be required to
prepay loans under the New Term Loan Facilities with net cash proceeds of asset sales or with excess
cash flow in each case attributable to foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the repatriation of such
amounts is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law or would result in material adverse tax
liability.

It is expected that we will have the ability to voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the New
Term Loan Facilities at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with
respect to LIBOR loans; provided, however, that any voluntary prepayment, refinancing or repricing of
the New Term Loan Facilities in connection with certain repricing transactions that occur prior to the
date that is six months from the closing of the New Term Loan Facilities shall be subject to a
prepayment payment of 1.00% of the principal amount of the applicable term loan facility so prepaid,
refinanced or repriced. The Borrower may voluntarily repay amounts outstanding under, and may
voluntarily reduce commitments made under, the New Revolving Credit Facility at any time without
premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to LIBOR loans.

**_Amortization and Maturity_**

The New Term Loan Facilities are expected to amortize in equal quarterly installments in an
aggregate annual amount equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount of the applicable term loan
facility, with the balance being payable on the date that is seven years after the closing of the New
Term Loan Facilities. Principal amounts outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be
due and payable in full at maturity five years from the date of the closing of the New Revolving Credit
Facility. The New Revolving Credit Facility will have no amortization.

**_Guarantee and Security_**

All obligations of the Borrower under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and any swap
agreements and cash management arrangements provided by any lender party to the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities or any of its affiliates and certain other persons will be unconditionally and
irrevocably guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Holdings and each existing and subsequently acquired
or organized direct or indirect material wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiary of the Borrower,
with customary exceptions including, among other things, where providing such guarantees is not
permitted by law, regulation or contract or would result in material adverse tax consequences.

All obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and any swap agreements and cash
management arrangements provided by any lender party to the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or
any of its affiliates and certain other persons, and the guarantees of such obligations, will be secured by
a perfected first-priority pledge of all capital stock and a perfected first-priority security interest in all
tangible and intangible assets, in each case owned by the Borrower or any guarantor and subject to
permitted liens and certain customary exceptions.

**_Certain Covenants and Events of Default_**

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are expected to contain a number of negative covenants
that, among other things, will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability and the ability of our
restricted subsidiaries to:

  - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;

   - create or incur liens;

   - engage in mergers, consolidations, liquidations or dissolutions;

   - sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;

   - make investments, acquisitions, loans or advances;

   - pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock;

  - prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain indebtedness;

   - enter into agreements that limit the ability of our restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors
to make distributions to us or our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur
liens on assets; and

   - enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will also contain certain customary affirmative covenants
and events of default (including a change of control) for facilities of this type.

**_Terms Subject to Change_**

The terms described above with respect to the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are subject to
change and a number of conditions, including the consummation of the Transactions and this offering.
To the extent that any of the conditions with respect to such indebtedness are not satisfied, such
indebtedness may not be available on the terms described herein or at all.

**Existing Notes**

As of the date hereof, we have outstanding $1,430.0 million aggregate principal amount of the
Existing 2023 Notes, $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Existing 2025 Notes and
$1,650.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Existing 2027 Notes.

The Existing Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior
indebtedness and senior in right of payment to our future subordinated indebtedness. The Existing
Notes are effectively subordinated to any of our and the guarantors’ existing and future secured debt to
the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt.

Interest on the Existing 2023 Notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Existing
2023 Notes will mature on April 1, 2023. The Existing 2023 Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in
part, at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the applicable Existing Indenture, plus accrued
and unpaid interest.

Interest on the Existing 2025 Notes is payable on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The
Existing 2025 Notes will mature on May 15, 2025. At any time on or after May 15, 2020, the Existing
2025 Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the
Existing Indenture governing the Existing 2025 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Before May 15,
2020, we may redeem the Existing 2025 Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to
100% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest and a ‘‘make-whole’’ premium.

91


-----

Interest on the Existing 2027 Notes is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The
Existing 2027 Notes will mature on January 15, 2027. At any time on or after January 15, 2022, the
Existing 2027 Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the applicable redemption prices set
forth in the Existing Indenture governing the Existing 2027 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Before January 15, 2022, we may redeem the Existing 2027 Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption
price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest and a ‘‘make-whole’’ premium. In
addition, before January 15, 2020, up to 40% of the aggregate of the Existing 2027 Notes and the
Notes issued may be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 105.750% of their principal amount, plus
accrued interest, using the proceeds of certain equity offerings.

**_Tender Offer and Consent Solicitations_**

On January 17, 2020, Merger Sub announced the commencement of the Tender Offers for any and
all of the Company’s outstanding Existing Notes and Consent Solicitations of holders of the Existing
Notes to amend the Existing Indentures with respect to the Proposed Amendments. The Tender Offers
and Consent Solicitations are being conducted upon the terms and subject to the conditions in the
related offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement and this offering memorandum is not an
offer to purchase or a solicitation of any consent with respect to any of the Existing Notes. The final
expiration date for the Tender Offers is February 14, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated by
Merger Sub. We expect to extend the expiration date from time to time such that the consummation of
the Tender Offers will occur substantially concurrently with the closing of the Merger.

As of January 31, 2020, holders of $1,279,830,000 aggregate principal amount of Existing 2023
Notes, $862,783,000 aggregate principal amount of Existing 2025 Notes and $1,615,115,000 aggregate
principal amount of Existing 2027 Notes had validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) their Existing
Notes and validly consented to the Proposed Amendments. On January 31, 2020, Zayo and the
applicable trustee for each Existing Indenture entered into a supplemental indenture in respect of each
Existing Indenture reflecting the Proposed Amendments with respect to the applicable series of
Existing Notes. Such supplemental indentures are effective but will not become operative until payment
for the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitations are made. Merger Sub’s obligation to consummate
the Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain
conditions, including the consummation of the Merger and the consummation of the Financing
Transactions on terms satisfactory to Merger Sub. We intend to fund the repurchase of the Existing
Notes pursuant to the Tender Offers with a portion of the net proceeds of this offering, together with
borrowings under our New Term Loan Facilities.

**DESCRIPTION OF SECURED NOTES**

**General**

Merger Sub will issue $1,000.0 million aggregate principal amount of % Senior Secured
Notes due 2027 (the ‘‘Notes’’) pursuant to an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the
‘‘Indenture’’), between Merger Sub and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the ‘‘Trustee’’) and
collateral agent (the ‘‘Notes Collateral Agent’’). Upon initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will be
obligations solely of Merger Sub. Merger Sub is a newly formed, wholly-owned direct Subsidiary of
Holdings. Upon the consummation of the Transactions, Merger Sub will merge with and into Zayo (the
‘‘Merger’’), with Zayo continuing as the surviving entity. Upon the consummation of the Transactions,
Zayo and the Guarantors will become parties to the Indenture pursuant to a supplemental indenture to
the Indenture, Merger Sub will cease to exist as a result of the Merger and the obligations under the
Indenture will become the obligations of Zayo and the Guarantors. The Notes will be issued in a
private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See
‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ The terms of the Notes will include the terms stated in the Indenture and will
not be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act.

The following description is only a summary of certain provisions of the Notes, the Note
Guarantees, the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement (as defined below), the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below), any Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) or
Acceptable Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) and the Security Documents (as
defined below), does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to, all the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement, the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement, any Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement or Acceptable Junior Priority
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, including the definitions therein of certain terms
used below. We urge you to read each of these documents because they, not this description, define
your rights as Holders. You may request copies of these agreements at our address set forth under the
heading ‘‘Summary.’’

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the heading ‘‘Certain Definitions.’’ In this
description, (i) the terms ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘our’’ and ‘‘us’’ each refer to Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and its consolidated Subsidiaries, (ii) the term ‘‘Zayo’’ refers to Zayo Group Holdings, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation, and not any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) the term ‘‘Merger Sub’’ refers to Front
Range BidCo, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Holdings, and not any of
its Subsidiaries, (iv) the term ‘‘Issuer’’ refers (a) prior to the consummation of the Merger, to Merger
Sub, and not any of its Subsidiaries and (b) from and after the consummation of the Merger, to Zayo,
and not any of its Subsidiaries and (v) the term ‘‘Holdings’’ initially refers to Front Range TopCo, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation, and not any of its Subsidiaries.

Unless the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering, on
the Issue Date, the initial purchasers will deposit an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of this
offering of Notes into an escrow account (the ‘‘Escrow Account’’) pursuant to the terms of an escrow
agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the ‘‘Escrow Agreement’’) dated
as of the Issue Date among Merger Sub, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent (as defined below). In the
event the Effective Date has not occurred on or before the Outside Date (as defined below) or upon
the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below). The Escrow Agreement, including the conditions to
the release of the Escrowed Property (as defined below), is more fully described below under
‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

**Brief Description of the Notes**

Unless the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering,
prior to the Effective Date, the Notes will be the Issuer’s senior secured obligations, secured by a firstpriority lien on the Escrowed Property held in the Escrow Account. From and after satisfaction of the
Escrow Release Conditions or on the Issue Date if the Merger is consummated substantially
simultaneously with the closing of this offering, the Notes will be senior secured obligations of the
Issuer.

The Notes will be:

   - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

   - pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer,
including its obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities and its obligations under the
Unsecured Notes, the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the Existing Notes and the Existing Notes
Indentures;

   - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuer, including its
obligations under the Unsecured Notes and the Existing Notes, to the extent of the value of the
Collateral (after giving effect to the sharing of such value with holders of equal or prior ranking
Liens on the Collateral);

   - secured on a first-priority basis by Liens on the Collateral (subject to Permitted Liens and
certain other exceptions) on an equal and ratable basis with all existing and future Equal Priority
Obligations of the Issuer (including its obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities); and

   - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities (including
trade payables) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors, other than Indebtedness
and liabilities owed to the Issuer or a Guarantor.

**Note Guarantees**

Prior to the Effective Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. On the Effective Date, upon the
consummation of the Merger and the execution by Zayo and each of the Guarantors of a supplemental
indenture to the Indenture, the Guarantors will jointly and severally fully and unconditionally
guarantee, on a senior secured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due,
whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and
the Indenture, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, expenses,
indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture.

Each Domestic Subsidiary that is a Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer (other than
any Receivables Subsidiary) that guarantees the payment of or borrows any Indebtedness under the
Senior Credit Facilities or guarantees certain other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary
Guarantor will, subject to certain exceptions and thresholds, guarantee the Notes. The Note
Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances as described under ‘‘—Release of Note
Guarantees.’’

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will be:

  - senior secured obligations of such Guarantor;

  - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor;

   - pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such
Guarantor, including its guarantee of the obligations under our Senior Credit Facilities and its

94


-----

guarantee of the obligations under the Unsecured Notes, the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the
Existing Notes and the Existing Notes Indentures;

   - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of such Guarantor, including
its guarantee of the obligations under the Unsecured Notes, the Existing Notes, the Unsecured
Notes Indenture and the Existing Notes Indentures, to the extent of the value of the Collateral
(after giving effect to the sharing of such value with holders of equal or prior ranking Liens on
the Collateral);

   - secured on a first-priority basis by Liens on the Collateral (subject to Permitted Liens and
certain other exceptions) on an equal and ratable basis with all existing and future Equal Priority
Obligations of such Guarantor (including its guarantee of Indebtedness or Obligations under the
Senior Credit Facilities); and

   - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities (including
trade payables) of its Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, other than Indebtedness and
liabilities owed to the Issuer or a Guarantor.

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of the non-guarantor
Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and other liabilities,
including their trade creditors, before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or
a Guarantor. As adjusted for the Transactions, our non-guarantor Subsidiaries would have accounted
for approximately $517.5 million, or 20.0%, of the Issuer’s consolidated total revenue, approximately
$82.5 million, or 25.8%, of the Issuer’s consolidated operating income, and approximately $190.2
million, or 14.8%, of the Issuer’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, in each case, for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2019. The Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately
$1,487.7 million, or 14.9%, of the Issuer’s consolidated total assets, and approximately $836.8 million,
or 9.9%, of the Issuer’s consolidated total liabilities, in each case as of December 31, 2019.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such
Indebtedness could be substantial. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the
Notes—The notes and the note guarantees are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our
non-guarantor subsidiaries.’’

Each Guarantor that makes a payment under its Note Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in
full of all guaranteed Obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in
an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective
net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to
prevent such Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law and,
therefore, are limited to the amount that such Guarantor could guarantee without such Note
Guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance; this limitation, however, may not be effective to
prevent such Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance. If a Note Guarantee were
rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other Indebtedness (including guarantees
and other contingent liabilities) of the applicable Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such
Indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Note Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See ‘‘Risk
Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws
may permit a court to void the notes and/or the note guarantees and the liens securing the secured
notes and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the
liens securing the secured notes and the related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to
return payments received from us in respect of the notes and the guarantees and, if that occurs, you
may not receive any payments on the notes.’’

**_Release of Note Guarantees_**

Each Note Guarantee by a Guarantor shall provide by its terms that its obligations under the
Indenture and such Note Guarantee shall be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged:

(a) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon any sale, exchange, issuance, transfer or
other disposition (by merger, consolidation, amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of
(i) the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, after which such Subsidiary Guarantor is no
longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary
Guarantor, in each case, if such sale, exchange, issuance, transfer or other disposition is not
prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(b) (1) upon the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Guarantor of the obligations
under the Senior Credit Facilities, (2) upon the release or discharge of such other guarantee that
required such Guarantor to provide such Note Guarantee pursuant to the first paragraph under
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees’’ or (3) in the case of a Note Guarantee
required to be provided pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of the first paragraph under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees,’’ upon a reduction in aggregate principal amount of the
Indebtedness or capital markets debt securities, as the case may be, being guaranteed by such
Guarantor that resulted in such Guarantor providing such Note Guarantee to $350.0 million or
less, except (A) in the case of clauses (1) and (2), a discharge or release by or as a result of
payment under such guarantee after the occurrence of a payment default or acceleration
thereunder (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still a
release) and (B) in all cases, if at the time of the release and discharge of such Note Guarantee,
such Guarantor would be required to guarantee the Notes pursuant to any of the provisions
described in ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees’’;

(c) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor
as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(d) upon the Issuer exercising the legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under ‘‘—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ or the Issuer’s obligations under
the Indenture being discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(e) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation or
winding up of such Subsidiary Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another Guarantor that is the
surviving Person in such merger, amalgamation, consolidation or winding up, or upon the
liquidation of such Subsidiary Guarantor;

(f) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension
Event; provided that, (i) such Note Guarantee shall not be released pursuant to this clause (f) for
so long as such Subsidiary Guarantor is an obligor with respect to any Indebtedness under the
Senior Credit Facilities and (ii) in the case of a Covenant Suspension Event, such Note Guarantee
shall be reinstated upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date;

(g) in the case of a Parent Guarantor, upon (i) such Parent Guarantor becoming ‘‘Previous
Holdings’’ in accordance with clause (ii) of the definition of ‘‘Holdings’’ and (ii) the assumption by
the applicable New Holdings of all obligations of such Previous Holdings under the Indenture, the
Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, any Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement or Acceptable
Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement and the applicable Security Documents, in each case,
pursuant to a supplemental indenture or other applicable documents or instruments; or

(h) as described under ‘‘—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver’’ or in accordance with the
provisions of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

**Ranking**

Unless the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering,
prior to the Effective Date, the Notes will be the Issuer’s senior secured obligations, secured by a firstpriority lien on the Escrowed Property held in the Escrow Account. From and after satisfaction of the
Escrow Release Conditions or on the Issue Date if the Merger is consummated substantially
simultaneously with the closing of this offering, the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and the Note
Guarantees will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, as the case
may be, and will rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the
Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, including the obligations under the Senior Credit
Facilities, the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the Unsecured Notes, the guarantees thereof, the Existing
Notes Indentures, the Existing Notes and the guarantees thereof, as applicable. The Obligations under
the Notes, the Indenture and the Note Guarantees will be secured by a first-priority lien on the
Collateral (subject to Permitted Liens and certain exceptions) on an equal and ratable basis with all
existing and future Equal Priority Obligations of the Issuer and the applicable Guarantor (including
obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities), and will be effectively senior to all existing and future
unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuer and the applicable Guarantor, including its obligations under the
Unsecured Notes and the Existing Notes, to the extent of the value of the Collateral (after giving effect
to the sharing of such value with holders of equal or prior ranking Liens on the Collateral). The phrase
‘‘in right of payment’’ refers to the contractual ranking of a particular Obligation, regardless of whether
an Obligation is secured.

Merger Sub is a limited purpose entity and does not hold or otherwise have any interest in any
material assets other than the Escrow Account. Substantially all of the operations of the Issuer are
conducted through the Issuer’s Subsidiaries. Not all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the
Notes, and as described under ‘‘Note Guarantees,’’ Note Guarantees may be released under certain
circumstances. In addition, the Issuer’s future Subsidiaries may not be required to guarantee the Notes.
Unless the Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries, including trade creditors,
and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally will have priority with
respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the
Guarantors, including the holders of the Notes, even if the claims of the creditors of such Subsidiaries
do not constitute Senior Indebtedness. The Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to
holders of Indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if
any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors, other than Indebtedness and liabilities owed
to the Issuer or a Guarantor.

As of December 31, 2019, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and the Guarantors
would have had:

  - $6,247.5 million of secured Senior Indebtedness, consisting of borrowings under the new term
loan facilities under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Notes and the related guarantees and
finance lease obligations, with $750.0 million available for drawdowns under the revolving credit
facility (without giving effect to $8.8 million of outstanding letters of credit); and

  - $2,302.3 million of unsecured Senior Indebtedness (including the Existing Notes and the
Unsecured Notes).

As of December 31, 2019, after giving effect to the Transactions, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries
would have had $836.8 million, or 9.9%, of the Issuer’s consolidated total liabilities, all of which would
have been structurally senior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness and
Disqualified Stock that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur or issue, and on the amount
of Preferred Stock that its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors may issue, such limitations

97


-----

are subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications. The amount of such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock that may be incurred or issued in compliance with the
covenants could be substantial and in certain circumstances, may be Secured Indebtedness. See
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock.’’ See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Despite
our substantial level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries will be permitted to incur substantial
additional indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial
indebtedness.’’ Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the incurrence or issuance of
liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the
Indenture.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial paying agent for the
Notes will be the Trustee.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar. The initial registrar will be the Trustee. The registrar will
maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time and will make
payments on and facilitate transfer of Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Issuer or any Guarantor in respect
of the Notes shall be made without any deduction or withholding for any taxes, unless the obligation to
deduct or withhold is required by Requirements of Law. If any such deduction or withholding is
required by Requirements of Law, payments by or on account of any obligation of the Issuer or any
Guarantor in respect of the Notes shall be made net of such deduction or withholding.

The Issuer may change the paying agents or the registrars without prior notice to the Holders. The
Issuer or any of its Affiliates may act as a paying agent or registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture and the restrictions set
forth in the section of this offering memorandum entitled ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ The registrar and the
Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in
connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes and fees required by law
and due on transfer. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for
redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer, an Alternate Offer, an Asset Sale Offer, an Advance Offer or other tender offer. Also, the
Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of
Notes to be redeemed.

The registered Holder will be treated as the owner of the Note for all purposes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue the Notes initially with an aggregate principal amount of $1,000.0 million. The
Notes will mature on, 2027.

Subject to compliance with the covenant described below under the caption ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ the Issuer may issue additional Notes from
time to time after the Issue Date under the Indenture (‘‘Additional Notes’’). The Notes offered hereby
and any Additional Notes issued under the Indenture after the Issue Date will be treated as a single
class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to
purchase; provided that if any Additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income

98


-----

tax purposes, such Additional Notes will have a separate CUSIP number and ISIN from the Notes.
Unless the context requires otherwise, references to ‘‘Notes’’ for all purposes of the Indenture, the
Note Guarantees and this ‘‘Description of Secured Notes’’ include any Additional Notes that are
actually issued.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable in cash
semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on, 2020,
to the Holders of record as of the close of business (if applicable) on the immediately preceding
and (whether or not a Business Day). Interest on the Notes will accrue from the
most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid
or duly provided for, from and including the Issue Date. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of
the paying agent maintained for such purpose as described under ‘‘—Paying Agent and Registrar for
the Notes’’ or, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the
Holders at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders or by wire transfer; provided
that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by
one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be made in
accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures. Until otherwise designated by the Issuer, the Issuer’s
office or agency will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose. If any interest payment
date, the maturity date or any earlier required repurchase or Redemption Date falls on a day that is a
Legal Holiday, the required payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no interest
on such payment will accrue in respect of the delay.

The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000
in excess thereof.

**Security for the Notes**

**_Collateral Generally_**

Unless the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering,
prior to the Effective Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will only be secured by a first-priority
lien on the Escrowed Property held in the Escrow Account. From and after the Effective Date, the
Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured, on an equal priority basis with (but without regard to
control of remedies) the Senior Credit Facilities Obligations, by perfected first-priority security interests
in the Collateral. Certain Equal Priority Secured Parties other than the Holders will have rights and
remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral benefiting the Holders, as described below under ‘‘—Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement.’’

The Issuer and the Guarantors will be able to incur additional Indebtedness secured by the
Collateral, including Additional Equal Priority Obligations and other Indebtedness secured by
Permitted Liens. The amount of such additional Indebtedness will be limited by the covenant described
under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.’’ Under certain
circumstances, the amount of any such additional Indebtedness could be significant. See ‘‘Risk
Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Despite our substantial level of
indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries will be permitted to incur substantial additional indebtedness.
This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.’’ and ‘‘Risk
Factors—Risks Related to the Collateral for the Secured Notes—The value of the Collateral securing
the secured notes and the related guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the
secured notes.’’

99

The Notes will be secured by perfected first-priority security interests on the Collateral, which will
generally consist of the personal property and other assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors (other than
Excluded Assets), whether owned on the Effective Date or thereafter acquired, including substantially
all tangible and intangible personal property of the Issuer and the Guarantors (including, but not
limited to, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, general intangibles (including contract rights),

only apply if the contractual prohibitions or contractual provisions that would be so violated or
that would trigger any such termination under clause (1)(i), (1)(ii) or (1)(iii) above (x) existed on
the Effective Date (or in the case of any contract of a Subsidiary that is acquired following the

consent, approval, license or authorization that has not been obtained, (ii) be prohibited by
applicable Requirements of Law, except, in each case of clause (i) above and this clause (ii), to the
extent such requirement or prohibition would be rendered ineffective under the UCC or any other
applicable Requirement of Law notwithstanding such requirement or prohibition; it being
understood that the term ‘‘Excluded Asset’’ shall not include proceeds or receivables arising out of
any asset described in clause (4)(i) or clause (4)(ii) to the extent that the assignment of such
proceeds or receivables is expressly deemed to be effective under the UCC or any other applicable

Requirement of Law notwithstanding the relevant requirement or prohibition or (iii) result in
material adverse tax consequences to Holdings, any other Parent Company or the Issuer or any of

(9) any cash or Cash Equivalents, Deposit Account, commodities account or securities
account (including securities entitlements and related assets but excluding cash and Cash
Equivalents representing the proceeds of assets otherwise constituting Collateral);

(10) any lease, license or other agreement or contract or any asset subject thereto (including
pursuant to a purchase money security interest, Financing Lease or similar arrangement) that is, in
each case, permitted by the Indenture to the extent that the grant of a security interest therein
would violate or invalidate such lease, license or agreement or contract or purchase money,
Financing Lease or similar arrangement or trigger a right of termination in favor of any other
party thereto (other than Holdings, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) after giving
effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of the UCC or any other applicable
Requirement of Law; it being understood that the term ‘‘Excluded Asset’’ shall not include any

Agent has reasonably agreed that the cost, burden, difficulty or consequence (including any effect
on the ability of the Issuer or any Guarantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary

security interest to the Holders of the security afforded thereby, which determination is evidenced
in writing;

(12) all assets of Holdings other than the Equity Interests of the Issuer;

101


-----

(13) receivables and related assets (or interests therein) (i) disposed of to any Receivables

(14) any governmental licenses or state or local franchises, charters or authorizations, to the
extent a security interest in any such license, franchise, charter or authorization would be
prohibited or restricted thereby (including any legally effective prohibition or restriction).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the Lien on any Collateral is not or cannot be
created and/or perfected on the Effective Date (other than (a) by the execution and delivery of the
Security Agreement by the Issuer and the Guarantors, (b) a Lien on Collateral that is of the type that
may be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under the UCC and (c) a Lien on the Equity
Interests of the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary required to be pledged pursuant to the Security
Agreement (other than Zayo or any Subsidiary thereof the certificate evidencing the Equity Interests of
which has not been delivered to the Issuer prior to the Effective Date, to the extent the Issuer has used
commercially reasonable efforts to procure delivery thereof) that may be perfected on the Effective
Date by the delivery of a stock or equivalent certificate (together with a stock power or similar
instrument endorsed in blank for the relevant certificate)), in each case after the Issuer’s use of
commercially reasonably efforts to do so or without undue burden or expense, the Issuer shall take all
necessary actions to create and/or perfect such Lien pursuant to arrangements to be mutually agreed
between the Issuer and the Senior Credit Facilities Collateral Agent acting reasonably.

In addition:

(a) Liens required to be granted from time to time pursuant to the Indenture shall be subject
to exceptions and limitations set forth in the applicable Security Documents;

(b) (A) perfection by control will not be required with respect to assets requiring perfection
through control agreements or other control arrangements, including Deposit Accounts, securities
accounts and commodities accounts (other than control or possession of pledged Equity Interests
(to the extent certificated) and Material Debt Instruments that constitute Collateral) and (B) no
blocked account agreement, deposit account control agreement or similar agreement will be
required for any Deposit Account, securities account or commodities account;

(c) no actions will be required to be taken, and the Notes Collateral Agent will not be
authorized to take any action, in any non-U.S. jurisdiction or required by the laws of any non-U.S.
jurisdiction to create any security interests in assets located or titled outside of the U.S. or to
perfect or make enforceable any security interests in any such assets (it being understood that
there shall be no security agreements or pledge agreements governed under the laws of any
non-U.S. jurisdiction and no non-U.S. intellectual property filings, searches or schedules); and

(d) no actions will be required to perfect a security interest in (A) any vehicle or other asset
subject to a certificate of title, (B) letter-of-credit rights not constituting supporting obligations of
other Collateral, (C) the Equity Interests of any Immaterial Subsidiary, (D) the Equity Interests of
any Person that is not a Subsidiary or (E) commercial tort claims with a value of less than
$50,000,000, except in the case of each of clauses (A) through (E), perfection actions limited solely
to the filing of a UCC financing statement.

It is understood and agreed that prior to the discharge of the Senior Credit Facilities Obligations,
to the extent that the Senior Credit Facilities Collateral Agent is satisfied with or agrees to any
deliveries or documents required to be provided in respect of any matters relating to the Collateral or
makes any determination in respect of any matters relating to the Collateral (including, without
limitation, extensions of time or waivers for the creation and perfection of security interests in, or the
obtaining of title insurance, legal opinions or other deliverables with respect to, particular assets
(including in connection with assets acquired, or Subsidiaries formed or acquired, after the Effective

102


-----

Date), the Notes Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be satisfied with such deliveries and/or
documents and the judgment of the Senior Credit Facilities Collateral Agent in respect of any such
matters under the Senior Credit Facilities shall be deemed to be the judgment of the Notes Collateral
Agent in respect of such matters under the Indenture and the Security Documents.

All terms used in the preceding paragraphs and defined in the UCC and not otherwise defined in
this ‘‘Description of Secured Notes’’ section have the meanings given to such terms in the UCC;
_provided that the term ‘‘instrument’’ has the meaning given to such term in Article 9 of the UCC._

**_Possession of the Collateral_**

Pursuant to and subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors
will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral and to freely
operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom. See ‘‘Risk Factors—
Risks Related to the Collateral for the Secured Notes—Sales of assets by the Issuer and the guarantors
could reduce the Collateral and the related guarantees.’’

**_After-Acquired Collateral_**

From and after the Effective Date, and subject to certain limitations and exceptions, if the Issuer
or any Guarantor creates, or acquires any security interest upon any property or asset (other than
Excluded Assets) that would constitute Collateral, the Issuer and each of the Guarantors must
concurrently grant a first-priority perfected security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) upon any such
Collateral, as security for the Secured Notes Obligations.

**_Further Assurances_**

The Security Agreement and the Indenture will provide that, from and after the Effective Date,
the Issuer and the Guarantors shall, at their sole expense, take all actions (including filing Uniform
Commercial Code and other financing statements, mortgages and deeds of trust) that may be required
under applicable law, or that the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent may reasonably request, in
order to ensure the creation, perfection and priority (or continuance thereof) of the security interests
created or intended to be created by the Security Documents.

**_Liens with Respect to the Collateral_**

On the Effective Date, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Notes Collateral Agent will enter into
the Security Documents, which will create the security interests in the Collateral. These security
interests will secure the payment and performance when due of all Equal Priority Obligations in respect
of the Notes (including the Note Guarantees) of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

**_Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement_**

On the Effective Date, the Notes Collateral Agent, the Senior Credit Facilities Collateral Agent,
the Issuer and the Guarantors will enter into an intercreditor agreement dated as of the Effective Date
(as the same may be amended, restated, renewed, replaced or otherwise modified from time to time,
the ‘‘Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement’’) with respect to the Collateral, which may be amended from
time to time without the consent of the Holders to add other parties holding Additional Equal Priority
Obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture, the Senior Credit Facilities and the Equal
Priority Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture and any other loan document relating to the Collateral, the
terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement shall govern and control.

103


-----

Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, only the ‘‘Controlling Collateral Agent’’ has the
right to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral. The Senior Credit Facilities
Collateral Agent will be the Controlling Collateral Agent on the Effective Date and will remain so until
the earlier of (1) the discharge of the Senior Credit Facilities Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling
Collateral Agent Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the ‘‘Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date’’).
After the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the Collateral Agent (other than the Senior
Credit Facilities Collateral Agent) of the Series of Equal Priority Obligations that constitutes the largest
outstanding aggregate principal amount of any then outstanding Series of Equal Priority Obligations
(excluding the Senior Credit Facilities Obligations) with respect to such Shared Collateral (the ‘‘Major
_Non-Controlling Collateral Agent’’) will become the Controlling Collateral Agent. As of the Effective_
Date, the Notes Collateral Agent will be the Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent.

With respect to any Shared Collateral, no Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or other
Non-Controlling Secured Party shall, or shall have the right to, instruct the Controlling Collateral
Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a
trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take
possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to
enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any
Shared Collateral.

While the Senior Credit Facilities Collateral Agent (or any other Collateral Agent that is not the
Notes Collateral Agent) is the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral Agent will have no
rights to take any action under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared
Collateral (unless and until it becomes the Controlling Collateral Agent).

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the Controlling Collateral Agent may deal with
the Shared Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No
Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will, or will have the right to,
contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral
Agent or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent or
any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral. In addition,
the Equal Priority Secured Parties may not contest or support any other person in contesting, in any
proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity,
attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the Equal Priority Secured Parties
in all or any part of the Shared Collateral, or the provisions of the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement.

If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing any Series of Equal
Priority Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Controlling Collateral Agent is taking
action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to
any Shared Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuer and any of the Guarantors or any Equal
Priority Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the
Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any
sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by any Collateral Agent or any Equal
Priority Secured Party and proceeds of any such distribution or payment (subject, in the case of any
such proceeds, to the immediately following paragraph) to which the Equal Priority Obligations are
entitled under any other intercreditor agreement shall be applied (i) among the Equal Priority
Obligations to the payment in full of the Equal Priority Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of
all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such) and (ii) after the discharge of all
Equal Priority Obligations, to the Issuer and the Guarantors or their successors or assigns, as their
interest may appear, or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of
competent jurisdiction may direct.

104


-----

The Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Equal Priority Secured Parties of
such Series (and not the Equal Priority Secured Parties of any other Series) bear the risk of (i) any
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the Equal Priority Obligations of
such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other
than another Series of Equal Priority Obligations), (y) any of the Equal Priority Obligations of such
Series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of
Equal Priority Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any other
obligations (other than another Series of Equal Priority Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the
security interest of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations but junior to the security interest of any
other Series of Equal Priority Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of
Equal Priority Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing
clause (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of Equal Priority Obligations, an ‘‘Impairment’’ of such
Series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of Equal Priority Obligations, the
results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of Equal Priority
Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations (including,
without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of Equal Priority
Obligations permitted by the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such
Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such Equal Priority Obligations subject to
such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the Equal Priority Obligations of any Series are modified
pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy
Code), any reference to such Equal Priority Obligations or the Equal Priority Obligations Documents
governing such Equal Priority Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so
modified.

None of the Equal Priority Secured Parties may institute in any bankruptcy case or other
proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Equal Priority Secured
Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise
with respect to any Shared Collateral. In addition, none of the Equal Priority Secured Parties may seek
to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition
of such Collateral. If any Equal Priority Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or
realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any Equal Priority Obligation Security
Documents or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any bankruptcy
case or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at
any time prior to the discharge of each of the Equal Priority Obligations, then it must hold such
Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other Equal Priority Secured Parties and
promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to
be distributed in accordance with the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent
forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies with respect to any Shared Collateral, then (whether or
not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the Notes
Collateral Agent and any other Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and
each other Series of Equal Priority Secured Parties, as applicable, upon such Shared Collateral will
automatically be released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized
therefrom will be applied as described in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

The Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes
subject to a bankruptcy case and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (‘‘DIP
_Financing’’) to be provided by one or more lenders (the ‘‘DIP Lenders’’) under Section 364 of the_
Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (or, in each
case, under any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law), each Equal Priority

105


-----

Secured Party agrees not to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral
securing the same (the ‘‘DIP Financing Liens’’) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared
Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party with respect to
such Shared Collateral opposes or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use
of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any
such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling
Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as
the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any Equal Priority Secured
Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP
Financing Liens rank equal in priority with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure
the Equal Priority Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party
will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as:

(A) the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their security interests
on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising
after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority relative to all the other
Equal Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the Equal Priority Secured Parties
constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy
case;

(B) the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted security interests on any
additional collateral pledged to any Equal Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or
otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same
priority relative to the other Equal Priority Secured Parties as set forth in the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement;

(C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the Equal
Priority Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement; and

(D) if any Equal Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of
periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the
proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement;

_provided that the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series will have a right to object to the grant_
of a security interest to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to security interests in
favor of the Equal Priority Secured Parties of such Series or its representative that do not constitute
Shared Collateral; and provided further that the Equal Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate
protection shall not object to any other Equal Priority Secured Party receiving adequate protection
comparable to any adequate protection granted to such Equal Priority Secured Parties in connection
with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral.

The Equal Priority Secured Parties acknowledge that the Equal Priority Obligations of any Series
may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other Equal Priority Obligations Documents, be
increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded,
refinanced or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, all without affecting
the priority of claims and application of proceeds set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the Equal Priority Secured
Parties of any Series.

**_Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement_**

If the Issuer and the Guarantors incur Indebtedness secured by Liens on the Collateral having, or
intending to have, a Junior Lien Priority ranking relative to the Liens on the Collateral securing the
Secured Notes Obligations, the Senior Credit Facilities Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral Agent
and the applicable Junior Priority Collateral Agent(s) will enter into an intercreditor agreement having
substantially the same terms as those described in this ‘‘—Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement’’
section (as the same may be amended, restated, renewed, replaced or otherwise modified from time to
time, a ‘‘Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement’’) or an Acceptable Junior Priority Intercreditor
Agreement. The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement may be entered into and amended from time
to time thereafter without the consent of the Holders to add other parties holding Senior Priority
Obligations and/or Junior Priority Obligations permitted to be incurred under the relevant agreements,
or their respective representatives.

We expect that under the terms of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, at any time at
which Senior Priority Obligations are outstanding, the Controlling Collateral Agent or any person
authorized by it will have the exclusive right to exercise any right or remedy with respect to the
Collateral and will also have the exclusive right to determine and direct the time, method and place for
exercising such right or remedy or conducting any proceeding with respect thereto. Subject to the terms
of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, the actions and determinations by the Controlling
Collateral Agent will be deemed to be the actions and determinations of, and controlling for, the
Junior Priority Collateral Agent. The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will apply at all times
prior to, during and after any insolvency or liquidation proceeding involving the Issuer or any
Guarantor and will provide, among other things, for Lien priorities as follows:

(i) the Senior Priority Obligations shall be secured by Liens on the Collateral ranking senior
in priority to the Liens on the Collateral securing the Junior Priority Obligations; and

(ii) the Junior Priority Obligations shall be secured by Liens on the Collateral ranking junior
in priority to the Liens on the Collateral securing the Senior Priority Obligations;

in each case, subject to Permitted Liens.

The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will not prohibit either the Senior Priority Obligations
or the Junior Priority Obligations from being increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated,
supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended, supplemented or
modified from time to time without affecting the relative lien priorities set forth in the Junior Priority
Intercreditor Agreement, in each case without the consent of any Senior Priority Secured Party or
Junior Priority Secured Party and will provide that the Senior Priority Obligations Documents may be
amended, restated, renewed, replaced or otherwise modified in accordance with their terms without the
consent of any Junior Priority Secured Party. The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will provide
that the Junior Priority Obligations Documents may be amended, restated, renewed, replaced or
otherwise modified in accordance with their terms without the consent of any Senior Priority Secured
Party.

Notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of filing or recordation of any document
or instrument or grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens on the Collateral securing the Junior
Priority Obligations or of any Liens on the Collateral securing the Senior Priority Obligations and
notwithstanding any provision of the UCC, any similar applicable law, any Junior Priority Obligations
Documents, the Security Documents, or any defect or deficiencies in, or failure to perfect, the Liens on
the Collateral securing the Senior Priority Obligations or any other circumstance whatsoever, the Junior
Priority Collateral Agent and each other Junior Priority Representative, on behalf of itself and each
Junior Priority Secured Party under its Junior Priority Obligations Documents, will agree that (1) any
Lien created on the Collateral (or purported to be created on the Collateral) securing any Junior

107


-----

Priority Obligations then or thereafter held by or on behalf of, or created for the benefit of, any Senior
Priority Secured Parties or any Senior Priority Representative or other agent or trustee therefor,
regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, possession, statute, operation of law, subrogation or
otherwise, shall have priority over and rank senior in all respects and prior to any Lien created on the
Collateral (or purported to be created on the Collateral) securing any Junior Priority Obligations and
(2) any Lien created on the Collateral (or purported to be created on the Collateral) securing any
Junior Priority Obligations then or thereafter held by or on behalf of, or created for the benefit of, any
Junior Priority Collateral Agent, any Junior Priority Secured Parties or any agent or trustee therefor,
regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, possession, statute, operation of law, subrogation or
otherwise, shall be subordinated to and rank junior and subordinate in all respects to all Liens created
on the Collateral (or purported to be created on the Collateral) securing any Senior Priority
Obligations.

The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if the Controlling Collateral Agent
holds a Lien on the Collateral securing any Senior Priority Obligations that can be perfected by the
possession or control of such Collateral or of any account in which such Collateral is held, and if such
Collateral or any such account is in fact in the possession or under the control of such Controlling
Collateral Agent or of agents or bailees of such Controlling Collateral Agent, or if it shall any time
obtain any landlord waiver or bailee’s letter or any similar agreement or arrangement granting it rights
or access to the Collateral, such Controlling Collateral Agent shall also hold such Collateral, or take
such actions with respect to such landlord waiver, bailee’s letter or similar agreement or arrangement,
as sub-agent or gratuitous bailee for the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority
Secured Parties.

_Foreclosure and Application of Proceeds_

The rights and remedies available to the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority
Secured Parties under the Junior Priority Security Documents and the actions permitted to be taken by
the Junior Priority Collateral Agent thereunder with respect to the Collateral will be subject to the
provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement. See ‘‘—Exercise of Remedies and Certain
Other Provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement.’’ The Junior Priority Intercreditor
Agreement and the Junior Priority Obligations Documents will require that if any Senior Priority
Obligations are then outstanding, the proceeds from any Collateral pursuant to the enforcement of any
security document or the exercise of any remedies thereunder, or upon any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding with respect to either the Issuer or any Guarantor, will be applied:

(1) first, to pay the Senior Priority Obligations as more fully described in the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) second, to pay the Junior Priority Obligations; and

(3) third, to the Issuer or such Guarantor;

In connection with any enforcement action with respect to the Collateral, including in respect of
any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, all proceeds from any disposition of Collateral will be applied
to the Senior Priority Obligations before being applied to any Junior Priority Obligations.

The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will also contain provisions that require the Junior
Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties to turn over to the Controlling
Collateral Agent for the benefit of all Senior Priority Secured Parties any and all Collateral and
proceeds thereof received in contravention of the payment priorities of the Junior Priority Intercreditor
Agreement, for application in accordance with the prior two paragraphs.

Furthermore, if any Senior Priority Obligations or commitments related thereto are then
outstanding, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties will have no

108


-----

ability to control any foreclosure or other exercise of remedies with respect to any of the Collateral
(including, without limitation, the time or method); provided, however, that if none of the Controlling
Collateral Agent, any other Senior Priority Collateral Agent nor any Senior Priority Secured Party is
diligently pursuing foreclosure or other exercise of remedies in good faith with respect to the Collateral
for 180 days after notice by the Junior Priority Collateral Agent to the Controlling Collateral Agent of
an Event of Default and of its intent to commence foreclosure or other remedies with respect to
Collateral (the ‘‘Standstill Period’’), the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured
Parties will be permitted to pursue foreclosure or other exercise of remedies with respect to such
Collateral after the end of the Standstill Period.

_Exercise of Remedies and Certain Other Provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement_

Subject to the Standstill Period defined above in ‘‘—Foreclosure and Application of Proceeds,’’
prior to payment in full of all of the Senior Priority Obligations (and termination of related
commitments), the Controlling Collateral Agent and the Senior Priority Secured Parties will have the
exclusive right to exercise remedies with respect to the Collateral, to exercise and enforce all privileges
and rights thereunder according to their discretion and the exercise of their good faith business
judgment, including, without limitation, the exclusive right to take or retake control or possession of
any Collateral and to hold, prepare for sale, process, sell, lease, dispose of, or liquidate any Collateral.
Notwithstanding any rights or remedies available to the Junior Priority Collateral Agent or the Junior
Priority Secured Parties under applicable law or otherwise, prior to the expiration of the Standstill
Period, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties will not be
permitted to, directly or indirectly, seek to foreclose or realize upon (judicially or non-judicially) their
Lien on, or otherwise exercise any rights or remedies with respect to, any Collateral (including, without
limitation, by setoff or notification of account debtors). The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement
will not (i) preclude the Junior Priority Collateral Agent from exercising certain actions that would be
permitted to be taken as unsecured creditors against the Issuer or any Guarantor, and except in any
bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding, as necessary to file a claim or statement of interest with respect
to the Junior Priority Obligations and in certain other limited situations, or (ii) prohibit the receipt by
the Junior Priority Collateral Agent or any Junior Priority Secured Party of regularly scheduled
payments of principal of, and regularly scheduled payments of interest on, the Junior Priority
Obligations, as the case may be, but in each case of clause (i) and (ii), subject to certain terms,
conditions and limitations as will be more fully set forth in the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement.
Following the acceleration of any Senior Priority Obligations (the ‘‘Purchase Event’’), within 30 days of
the Purchase Event, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and Junior Priority Secured Parties will have
the option, by notice to the representative of the Senior Priority Secured Parties, to purchase all (but
not less than all) of the Senior Priority Obligations in full in cash. If such option is exercised, the
purchase of the Senior Priority Obligations will be required to be consummated within not less than
five Business Days and not more than 10 Business Days of the notice.

The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will also, among other things:

(1) with respect to the Collateral, provide that so long as any Senior Priority Obligations are
outstanding, only the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Senior Priority Secured Parties will have
the right to restrict or permit, or approve, the sale, transfer, or other disposition of the Collateral
in connection with an enforcement of remedies against such Collateral;

(2) so long as the Senior Priority Obligations are outstanding, prohibit the grant of additional
Liens in favor of the Junior Priority Collateral Agent on any property or assets of the Issuer and
the Guarantors to the extent the Collateral Agents for the Senior Priority Obligations have not
been granted a Lien on such property and assets;

109


-----

(3) provide that in the event of a sale, transfer or other disposition of any specified item of
Collateral, the Liens granted to the Junior Priority Representatives and the Junior Priority Secured
Parties upon such Collateral to secure Junior Priority Obligations will terminate and be released,
automatically and without any further action, concurrently with the termination and release of all
Liens granted upon such Collateral to secure Senior Priority Obligations;

(4) provide that if the Junior Priority Collateral Agent or any Junior Priority Secured Party
holds or acquires any Lien on any assets or property of the Issuer or any Guarantor securing any
Junior Priority Obligations that are not also subject to the Liens securing the Senior Priority
Obligations under the Senior Priority Obligations Documents, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent
or such Junior Priority Secured Party (i) will be obligated to notify the Controlling Collateral
Agent promptly upon becoming aware thereof and, unless such Issuer or Guarantor shall promptly
grant a similar Lien on such assets or property to the Controlling Collateral Agent as security for
the Senior Priority Obligations, must assign such Lien to the Controlling Collateral Agent as
security for the Senior Priority Obligations (but may retain a junior Lien on such assets or
property subject to the terms of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement) and (ii) until such
assignment or such grant of a similar Lien to the Controlling Collateral Agent, will be deemed to
also hold and have held such Lien for the benefit of the Controlling Collateral Agent as security
for the Senior Priority Obligations. Any amounts received by or distributed to any Junior Priority
Secured Party pursuant to or as a result of any Lien granted in contravention of the foregoing
shall be subject to the turnover and related provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor
Agreement;

(5) provide that if any Senior Priority Secured Party is required in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding or otherwise to disgorge, turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of the
Issuer or any Guarantor (or any trustee, receiver or similar person therefor), because the payment
of such amount was declared to be, or otherwise avoided as, fraudulent or preferential in any
respect or for any other reason, any amount (a ‘‘Recovery’’), whether received as proceeds of
security, enforcement of any right of setoff, recoupment or otherwise, then the Senior Priority
Obligations will be reinstated to the extent of such Recovery and deemed to be outstanding as if
such payment had not occurred and the Senior Priority Secured Parties will be entitled to a future
discharge of Senior Priority Obligations with respect to all such recovered amounts. If the Junior
Priority Intercreditor Agreement will have been terminated prior to such Recovery, the Junior
Priority Intercreditor Agreement will be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior
termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the
parties thereto. The Junior Priority Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior
Priority Secured Party will agree that none of them shall be entitled to benefit from any avoidance
action affecting or otherwise relating to any distribution or allocation made in accordance with the
Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, whether by preference or otherwise, it being understood
and agreed that the benefit of such avoidance action otherwise allocable to them shall instead be
allocated and turned over for application in accordance with the priorities set forth in the Junior
Priority Intercreditor Agreement;

(6) provide that, upon any insolvency or liquidation proceeding involving either the Issuer or
any Guarantor, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties:

(A) shall not raise any objection to (i) the use of cash collateral by either the Issuer or
any Guarantor if permitted (or not objected to) by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any
Senior Priority Secured Party or (ii) either the Issuer or any Guarantor obtaining DIP
Financing,

(B) will not request adequate protection or other relief in connection with any such use
of cash collateral or any such DIP Financing, provided that the Junior Priority Collateral

110


-----

Agent or the Junior Priority Secured Parties shall be permitted to (i) seek adequate protection
in the form of additional or replacement Liens on the Collateral or additional or replacement
collateral to secure the Junior Priority Obligations as long as, in each case, the Senior Priority
Secured Parties are also granted such additional or replacement Liens on the Collateral or
additional or replacement collateral and such Liens that secure the Junior Priority Obligations
shall rank junior to and be subordinated to the Liens securing the Senior Priority Obligations
on the same basis of priority as the Liens securing the Senior Priority Obligations rank to the
Liens securing the Junior Priority Obligations in accordance with the Junior Priority
Intercreditor Agreement, and (ii) if the Senior Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate
protection in the form of a superpriority administrative expense claim, seek and receive
adequate protection of its junior interest in the Collateral in form of a superpriority
administrative expense claim, including a claim arising under Section 507(b) of the Bankruptcy
Code, provided however that any such superpriority administrative expense claim of the Junior
Priority Collateral Agent shall rank junior and be subordinated to any superpriority
administrative expense claim granted to the Senior Priority Secured Parties with respect to
such Collateral,

(C) will not contest (or support any other Person in contesting) (x) any request by the
Controlling Collateral Agent or the Senior Priority Secured Parties for adequate protection or
(y) any objection made by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Senior Priority Secured
Parties to any motion, relief, action or insolvency or liquidation proceeding claiming a lack of
adequate protection,

(D) will raise no objection to (or otherwise contest) any motion for relief from the
automatic stay or from any injunction against foreclosure or enforcement in respect of Senior
Priority Obligations made by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Senior Priority Secured
Parties, and, so long as Senior Priority Obligations are outstanding, will not seek (or support
any person in seeking) any such relief in respect of the Collateral without the consent of the
Controlling Collateral Agent,

(E) will raise no objection to (or otherwise contest) any lawful exercise by any Senior
Priority Secured Party of the right to credit bid Senior Priority Obligations at any sale in
foreclosure of Collateral,

(F) will raise no objection to (and will not otherwise contest) any order relating to a sale
of assets of the Issuer or Guarantors for which the Controlling Collateral Agent has consented
(or not objected to) that provides, to the extent the sale is to be free and clear of Liens, that
the Liens securing the Senior Priority Obligations and the Liens securing the Junior Priority
Obligations will attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of priority as the Liens
securing the Senior Priority Obligations rank relative to the Liens securing the Junior Priority
Obligations in accordance with the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement,

(G) with respect to the Collateral, will not oppose any sale of assets consented to (or not
objected to) by the Controlling Collateral Agent whether pursuant to Section 363(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision under the law applicable in the insolvency or
liquidation proceeding), in each case, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations as
more fully set forth in the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, and

(H) so long as Senior Priority Obligations are outstanding, will not assert or enforce any
claim under Section 506(c) of the United States Bankruptcy Code senior to or on a parity
with the Liens securing the Senior Priority Obligations for costs or expenses of preserving or
disposing of any Collateral;

111


-----

(7) provide that the Junior Priority Collateral Agent will not contest, protest or object to any
lien enforcement action or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Senior
Priority Secured Parties or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Senior
Priority Secured Parties of any rights and remedies relating to the Collateral under the Senior
Priority Obligations Documents or otherwise and has no right to direct the Controlling Collateral
Agent to take any foreclosure or other action;

(8) provide that no Junior Priority Representative or any other Junior Priority Secured Party
(whether in the capacity of a secured or unsecured creditor) may directly or indirectly propose,
support or vote in favor of any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan that
is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor
Agreement, other than with the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent or to the
extent any such plan is proposed or supported by the class of holders of Senior Priority Obligations
required under Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code; and

(9) provide that each Junior Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each
applicable Junior Priority Secured Party, will acknowledge and agree that (a) the grants of Liens
securing the Senior Priority Obligations and the Junior Priority Obligations constitute separate and
distinct grants of Liens and (b) because of, among other things, their differing rights in the
Collateral, the Junior Priority Obligations are fundamentally different from the Senior Priority
Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive
restructuring plan proposed, confirmed or adopted in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and,
if it is held that the claims of the Senior Priority Secured Parties and the Junior Priority Secured
Parties in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes
of senior and junior secured claims) under a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive
restructuring plan, then each Junior Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of the
applicable Junior Priority Secured Parties, will acknowledge and agree that all distributions from
the Collateral shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims
against the Issuer and the Guarantors in respect of the Collateral (with the effect being that, to
the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all
claims held by the Junior Priority Secured Parties), the Senior Priority Secured Parties shall be
entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition
interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees, and expenses
(whether or not allowed or allowable in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any
distribution is made from the Collateral in respect of the Junior Priority Obligations, with each
Junior Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Priority Secured
Party, acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Controlling Collateral Agent amounts
otherwise received or receivable by them from the Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate
the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery
of the Junior Priority Secured Parties.

If the Issuer incurs additional Senior Priority Obligations or additional Junior Priority Obligations
that are permitted by the provisions of the Senior Priority Obligations Documents and the Junior
Priority Obligations Documents, as applicable, (1) any such additional Senior Priority Obligations may
be secured by a Lien having Senior Lien Priority on the Collateral if the Senior Priority Representative
with respect to such additional Senior Priority Obligations executes and delivers a joinder to the Junior
Priority Intercreditor Agreement or Acceptable Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement and the Issuer
delivers an Officer’s Certificate stating that the additional Senior Priority Obligations are permitted
under the Senior Priority Obligations Documents, and (2) any such additional Junior Priority
Obligations may be secured by a Lien having Junior Lien Priority on the Collateral if the Junior
Priority Representative with respect to such additional Junior Priority Obligations executes and delivers
a joinder to the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement or Acceptable Junior Priority Intercreditor

112


-----

Agreement and the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate stating that the additional Junior Priority
Obligations are permitted under the Junior Priority Obligations Documents.

The Controlling Collateral Agent, any other Senior Priority Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral
Agent and applicable Junior Priority Collateral Agent may enter into one or more additional Junior
Priority Intercreditor Agreements or Acceptable Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreements in connection
with the incurrence of additional Indebtedness secured by Liens on the Collateral having, or intending
to have, a Junior Lien Priority ranking relative to the Liens on the Collateral securing the Secured
Notes Obligations. The Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee shall execute any such intercreditor
agreement upon the receipt of an Officer’s Certificate stating that such execution and delivery is
permitted by the Indenture and all conditions precedent relating to such execution and delivery have
been satisfied.

Without the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent, no Junior Priority
Obligations Document may be amended, restated, renewed, replaced or otherwise modified, or entered
into, and no indebtedness under the Junior Priority Obligations Document may be refinanced, to the
extent such amendment, restatement, supplement or modification or refinancing, or the terms of such
new Junior Priority Obligations Document, would contravene the provisions of the Junior Priority
Intercreditor Agreement or Acceptable Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

In the event that the Senior Priority Collateral Agent and/or the Senior Priority Secured Parties
enter into any amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the Senior Priority Security
Documents for the purpose of adding to or deleting from, or waiving or consenting to any departures
from any provisions of, any such Senior Priority Security Documents or changing in any manner the
rights of the Senior Priority Collateral Agent, the Senior Priority Secured Parties, the Issuer or any
Guarantor thereunder (including the release of any Liens on Collateral securing the Senior Priority
Obligations), then such amendment, waiver or consent shall apply automatically to any comparable
provision of each comparable Junior Priority Security Document without the consent of or action by
the Junior Priority Collateral Agent or any Junior Priority Secured Party; provided, however, that
(x) no such amendment, waiver or consent shall have the effect of (i) removing assets subject to the
Lien of any Junior Priority Security Document, except to the extent that a release of such Lien is
provided for in the Junior Priority Obligations Documents or (ii) altering the terms of the Junior
Priority Obligations Documents to permit other Liens on the Collateral not permitted under the terms
of the Junior Priority Obligations Documents and (y) written notice of such amendment, waiver or
consent shall have been given to the Junior Priority Collateral Agent within 10 Business Days after the
effectiveness of such amendment, waiver or consent.

**_Release of the Collateral_**

The Issuer and the Guarantors will be entitled to the release of property and other assets
constituting Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees under any one or
more of the following circumstances:

(1) to enable the Issuer or any Guarantor to consummate the sale, transfer or other
disposition (including by the termination of Financing Leases or the repossession of the leased
property in a Financing Lease by the lessor and by means of a Restricted Payment) of such
Collateral to any Person other than the Issuer or a Guarantor, to the extent such sale, transfer or
other disposition is not prohibited by the covenant described under ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option
of Holders—Asset Sales’’;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee, with respect to the
property and other assets of such Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor from its Note
Guarantee;

113


-----

(3) with respect to Collateral that is Capital Stock, upon (i) the dissolution or liquidation of
the issuer of that Capital Stock that is not prohibited by the Indenture or (ii) upon the designation
by the Issuer of such issuer of Capital Stock as an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the Indenture;

(4) with respect to any Collateral that becomes an ‘‘Excluded Asset,’’ upon it becoming an
Excluded Asset;

(5) in accordance with the second paragraph under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Liens’’;

(6) to the extent the Liens on the Collateral securing the Senior Credit Facilities Obligations
are released by the Senior Credit Facilities Collateral Agent (other than any release by, or as a
result of, payment of the Senior Credit Facilities Obligations), upon the release of such Liens;

(7) in connection with any enforcement action taken by the Controlling Collateral Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement; or

(8) as described under ‘‘—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver’’ below.

The Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the related Note Guarantees also shall
automatically and without the need for any further action by any Person be terminated and released,
(i) upon payment in full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes
and all other Obligations in respect of the Notes under the Indenture, the related Note Guarantees and
the Security Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, are paid, (ii) upon a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance with respect
to the Notes under the Indenture as described below under ‘‘—Legal Defeasance and Covenant
Defeasance’’ or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture with respect to the Notes as described
under ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’ or (iii) pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement
described above and the Security Documents with respect to the Notes, in each case, other than any
contingent obligations (including contingent indemnity obligations not yet due or payable).

In addition, any Lien on any Collateral may be subordinated to the holder of any Lien on such
Collateral that is created, incurred, or assumed pursuant to clauses (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (i), (j), (l),
(m) (with respect to any assets subject to such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction), (n) (solely to the
extent such Lien related to Indebtedness incurred under clause (n) of the second paragraph under
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock’’), (o) (other than any Lien on the Equity Interests of any Subsidiary Guarantor),
(p), (r), (u) (to the extent the relevant Lien is of the type to which the Lien of the Notes Collateral
Agent is otherwise required or, if requested by the Issuer, permitted to be subordinated pursuant to
any of the other exceptions included in this paragraph), (w), (x), (y), (z)(i), (bb), (cc), (dd) (in the case
of clause (ii), to the extent the relevant Lien covers cash collateral posted to secure the relevant
obligation), (ee), (ff), (gg), (hh) (and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any thereof to the
extent such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be secured under clause (k) of the definition of
‘‘Permitted Liens’’), (ii), (jj), (kk) and/or (oo) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens’’ to the extent
required by the terms of the Obligations secured by such Liens.

In connection with any release of Collateral which requires execution by the Notes Collateral
Agent, the Notes Collateral Agent shall receive an Officer’s Certificate stating that such release is
permitted by the Indenture and the Security Documents.

**_Sufficiency of Collateral_**

The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include,
among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the
availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral

114


-----

would also be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market
value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By its nature, portions
of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, we
cannot assure you that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In
addition, in the event of a bankruptcy, the ability of the Holders to realize upon any of the Collateral
may be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations as described below. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Collateral for the Secured Notes—The value of the Collateral securing the secured
notes offered hereby and the related guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under
the secured notes’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Collateral for the Secured Notes—Sales of
assets by the Issuer and the guarantors could reduce the Collateral and the related guarantees.’’

**_Foreclosure_**

Subject to the terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement and certain other restrictions,
after the occurrence of an Event of Default (but only for so long as such Event of Default is
continuing), the Security Documents and the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement provide for
(among other available remedies) the foreclosure upon and sale of the Collateral by the Controlling
Collateral Agent and the distribution of the net proceeds of any such sale to the Equal Priority Secured
Parties and any other holder of Equal Priority Obligations on a pro rata basis, subject to any prior
Liens on the Collateral. In the event of foreclosure on the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the
Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy in full the Issuer and the Guarantors’ obligations under the
Notes.

**_Certain Bankruptcy Limitations_**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral after the
occurrence of an Event of Default (for so long as such Event of Default is continuing) would be
significantly impaired by any Bankruptcy Law in the event that a bankruptcy case were to be
commenced by or against the Issuer or any Guarantor prior to the Notes Collateral Agent’s having
repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the
Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent and the Controlling Collateral
Agent is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing
of security without bankruptcy court approval.

In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how
long payments under the Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case,
whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of
the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders would be
compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The Bankruptcy Code permits
only the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, costs and attorneys’ fees to a secured creditor
during a debtor’s bankruptcy case to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the Collateral is
determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the
obligations secured by the Collateral. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Collateral for the
Secured Notes—In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the guarantors, the holders of the
secured notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuer’s obligations in
respect of the secured notes exceed the fair market value of the Collateral securing the secured notes
and the related guarantees.’’

Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the
Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Holders would hold secured
claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the Holders are entitled, and
unsecured claims with respect to such shortfall.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Escrow Conditions**

Unless the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering,
concurrently with the closing of this offering, Merger Sub will enter into the Escrow Agreement with
the Trustee and U.S. Bank National Association, as escrow agent (in such capacity, together with its
successors, the ‘‘Escrow Agent’’). Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, Merger Sub will deposit (or cause
to be deposited) into the Escrow Account an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the offering of the
Notes sold on the Issue Date (collectively and, together with any other property from time to time held
by the Escrow Agent in the Escrow Account, the ‘‘Escrowed Property’’). The Escrow Account will not
include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the Notes which is required
to be paid upon a Special Mandatory Redemption. On the Issue Date, one or more of the Investors
will execute a commitment letter pursuant to which such Investor(s) will commit to fund, upon the
occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption, the amount by which the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds the amount of the
Escrowed Property in the Escrow Account on such date.

The Escrowed Property will be held in the Escrow Account until the earlier of (i) an Escrow
Release (as defined below) following the delivery by Merger Sub to the Escrow Agent of the Officer’s
Certificate referred to in the next succeeding paragraph and (ii) a Special Mandatory Redemption
Date. Merger Sub will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the Holders, subject to
certain liens of the Escrow Agent, a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account and all
Eligible Escrow Investments therein to secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price
(as defined below); provided, however, that such lien and security interest shall automatically be released
and terminated at such time as the Escrowed Property is released from the Escrow Account on the
Escrow Release Date (as defined below). The Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property in such
Eligible Escrow Investments, and liquidate such Eligible Escrow Investments, as Merger Sub will from
time to time direct in writing.

Subject to the provisions described below in ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ Merger Sub will
only be entitled to direct the Escrow Agent to release Escrowed Property (in which case the Escrowed
Property will be paid to or as directed by Merger Sub) (the ‘‘Escrow Release’’) upon delivery to the
Escrow Agent, on or prior to August 14, 2020 (the ‘‘Outside Date’’), of an Officer’s Certificate,
certifying that the following conditions (the ‘‘Escrow Release Conditions’’) have been or, substantially
concurrently with the release of the Escrowed Property, will be satisfied (the date of the Escrow
Release is hereinafter referred to as the ‘‘Escrow Release Date’’):

(1) the Merger will occur substantially concurrently with such release;

(2) all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of, and borrowings under, the Senior Credit
Facilities (other than the release of the Escrowed Property) have been satisfied or waived in all
material respects; and

(3) Zayo will substantially concurrently with such release, assume all of the obligations of
Merger Sub under the Notes and the Indenture, and the Guarantors will substantially concurrently
with such release, become, by supplemental indenture, party to the Indenture in the capacities
described herein.

The Escrow Release shall occur promptly upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of an Officer’s
Certificate certifying to the foregoing. Upon the occurrence of the Escrow Release, the Escrow
Account shall be reduced to zero and the Escrowed Property and interest thereon shall be paid out in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

If at any time the Escrow Account contains funds having an aggregate value in excess of the
Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below) in respect of the Notes as determined by the
Issuer, such excess cash shall be released to or at the direction of the Issuer.

116


-----

By its acceptance of a Note, each Holder shall be deemed to have authorized and directed the
Trustee and the Escrow Agent to enter into and perform its obligations, if any, under the Escrow
Agreement.

If the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering, the
foregoing provisions relating to the escrow of proceeds of the Notes shall not apply and shall have no
force or effect.

**Special Mandatory Redemption**

If (i) the Escrow Agent has not received the Officer’s Certificate described above under ‘‘Escrow
of Proceeds; Escrow Conditions’’ on or prior to the Outside Date, (ii) Merger Sub notifies the Escrow
Agent in writing that in its reasonable judgment the Merger will not be consummated on or prior to
the Outside Date or (iii) Merger Sub notifies the Escrow Agent in writing that the Transaction
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, then the Escrow Agent shall release the
Escrowed Property (including investment earnings thereon and proceeds thereof) to the Trustee, on the
third Business Day succeeding (a) the Outside Date (in the case of clause (i)) or (b) the date of such
notice (in the case of clause (ii) or (iii)), as the case may be (such third Business Day, the ‘‘Special
_Mandatory Redemption Date’’), and the Trustee shall pay the amounts to the paying agent for payment_
to the Holders of the Notes (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption’’) at a redemption price calculated by
Merger Sub (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption Price’’) equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the
Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date. On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Trustee will pay to Merger Sub
any Escrowed Property (including investment earnings thereon and proceeds thereof) in excess of the
amount necessary to effect the Special Mandatory Redemption on such Notes on the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date.

If the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering, the
foregoing provisions relating to Special Mandatory Redemption of the Notes shall not apply and shall
have no force or effect.

**Activities Prior to Release**

Prior to the Escrow Release Date, the activities of Merger Sub will be restricted to issuing the
Notes, engaging in other financing activities related to the Transactions and performing its obligations
in connection with any documents relating thereto, issuing capital stock to, and receiving capital
contributions from, Holdings or any other Parent Company, performing its obligations in respect of the
Notes under the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement and the purchase agreement with the initial
purchasers, performing its obligations under the Transaction Agreement and consummating the
Transactions, redeeming the Notes and any other indebtedness issued by it in connection with the
Transactions, if applicable, and conducting such other activities as are necessary or appropriate in
connection with the Transactions or to carry out the activities described above.

Prior to the Escrow Release Date, none of Zayo or its Subsidiaries will be party to the Indenture
and will not be controlled by Merger Sub; accordingly, prior to the Escrow Release Date, none of Zayo
or its Subsidiaries will be subject to the restrictions, agreements or covenants set forth in the Indenture
and described herein.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes, other than as described above under ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ In
addition, other than as required under ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control’’
and ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,’’ the Issuer will not be required to offer to

117


-----

repurchase or redeem or otherwise modify the terms of any of the Notes upon a change in control of,
or other events involving, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries that may adversely affect the
creditworthiness of the Notes. We and our equity holders, including the Investors, their respective
Affiliates and members of our management, may, at their discretion, at any time and from time to time
purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Notes, in the open market, in privately
negotiated transactions, through tender offers or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations
contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, any purchases made
by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or
unsecured debt, including borrowing under the Senior Credit Facilities. The amounts involved in any
such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with
respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in
the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such purchases made at prices below the
‘‘adjusted issue price’’ (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable
cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which could be material, and in related adverse tax
consequences to us.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below or in the circumstances set forth in the tenth paragraph under
‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,’’ the Issuer will not be entitled to
redeem the Notes at its option prior to, 2021.

At any time prior to, 2021, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions,
redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon notice as described under the heading ‘‘—Repurchase at the
Option of Holders—Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but excluding the date of redemption (any applicable date of redemption, the ‘‘Redemption
_Date’’), subject to the right of Holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive_
interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date.

On and after, 2021, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem
the Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under the heading ‘‘—Repurchase at the
Option of Holders—Selection and Notice,’’ at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of
principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of
record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period
beginning on of each of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2021 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 102.000%
2022 and thereafter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100.000%

In addition, prior to, 2021, the Issuer may, at its option, upon notice as described under
the heading ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and Notice,’’ on one or more
occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional
Notes) issued and outstanding under the Indenture at a redemption price (as calculated by the Issuer)
equal to (i) % of the aggregate principal amount thereof, in an amount equal to or less than the
amount of net cash proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings to the extent such net cash proceeds
are received by or contributed to the Issuer, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to,
but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record of the Notes
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or
prior to the Redemption Date; provided that (a) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the

118


-----

Notes originally issued under the Indenture on the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately after
the occurrence of each such redemption (except to the extent otherwise repurchased or redeemed or to
be repurchased or redeemed and for which a notice of repurchase or redemption has been issued at or
about such time in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) and (b) each such redemption occurs
within 180 days of the date of closing of such Equity Offering.

In addition, at any time prior to, 2021, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes outstanding (including Additional Notes), upon notice as described
under the heading ‘‘‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and Notice,’’ at a purchase
price equal to 103% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right
of Holders of record of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, if Holders of not
less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party approved in writing by the
Issuer making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (except that such notice may be delivered or mailed more than
60 days prior to the Redemption Date or purchase date if the notice is subject to one or more
conditions precedent as described under ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and
Notice’’), given not more than 60 days following such purchase date, to redeem (with respect to the
Issuer) or purchase (with respect to a third party) all of the Notes that remain outstanding following
such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other Holder in such tender offer (which may
be less than par and shall exclude any early tender premium or similar premium and any accrued and
unpaid interest paid to any Holder in such tender offer) plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
thereon, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date or purchase date, subject to the right of Holders of
record of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date or purchase date. For the avoidance of doubt, in
determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer, Notes
owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer, by portfolio companies or funds controlled or managed by an
Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, or by Debt Fund Affiliates shall be deemed to be
outstanding.

The Notes to be redeemed shall be selected in the manner described under ‘‘—Repurchase at the
Option of Holders—Selection and Notice.’’

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Effective Date, unless,
prior to or concurrently with the time the Issuer is required to make a Change of Control Offer, the
Issuer or a third-party has mailed or delivered, or otherwise sent through electronic transmission, a
redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under ‘‘—Optional
Redemption’’ or ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge,’’ the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the
Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) at a price in cash equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof (or such higher amount as the Issuer may determine
(any Change of Control Offer at a higher amount, an ‘‘Alternate Offer’’)) (such price, the ‘‘Change of
_Control Payment’’) plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding the date of purchase,_
subject to the right of Holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest

119


-----

due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date
(as defined below). Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such
Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the
address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise deliver in accordance with the
procedures of DTC, with the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled
‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,’’ and that all Notes properly
tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 20 Business Days
nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment Date’’);
_provided, that the Change of Control Payment Date shall be delayed until such time (including_
more than 60 days after the date such notice is sent) as any or all such conditions referred to in
clause (8) below shall be satisfied or waived;

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue
interest;

(4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment plus
accrued and unpaid interest on all properly tendered Notes, all Notes accepted for payment
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control
Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer
will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled ‘‘Option of Holder to Elect
Purchase’’ on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures
of DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to
the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) until the close of business on the tenth Business Day after the date such notice is sent (or
such later time and date as the Issuer may decide in its sole discretion) (such time and date, the
‘‘withdrawal deadline’’), that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their
election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not
later than the withdrawal deadline, as electronic transmission (in PDF), a facsimile transmission or
letter or other communication in accordance with the procedures of DTC settling forth the name
of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement
that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased;

(7) that if less than all of such Holder’s Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be
issued new Notes (or, in the case of global notes, such Notes shall be reduced by such amount of
Notes that the Holder has tendered) and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the
unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered (the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be
equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof);

(8) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the
Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control or such other
conditions specified therein and shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state
that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such
time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered) as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may
be rescinded in the event that the Issuer reasonably believes that any or all such conditions
(including the occurrence of such Change of Control) will not be satisfied or waived by the Change
of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and

120


-----

(9) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a
Holder must follow.

If a notice relating to a Change of Control Offer that is subject to one or more conditions
precedent (other than the occurrence of a Change of Control) is later rescinded as described in
clause (8) above as a result of the failure of such condition(s) to be satisfied or waived (or as a result
of the Issuer reasonably believing that such will be the case), the offer described in such notice will not
be deemed a valid ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’ for purposes of this covenant.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of
the Notes through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer
will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have
breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer,

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control
Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted
together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof
have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer.

The Senior Credit Facilities will, and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to
Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or any of its Affiliates) becomes a party may, provide that certain
change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a
Change of Control under the Unsecured Notes Indenture or the Indenture). If the Issuer experiences a
change of control that triggers a default under the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other
agreements or results in a requirement to offer to repurchase the Indebtedness governed by such
agreement, including the Unsecured Notes Indenture, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to
refinance the Senior Credit Facilities and/or the Indebtedness governed by such other agreements. In
the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other
agreements or repurchase such Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under
the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements being declared due and payable.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control
may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
this Offering—We may not be able to finance an offer to purchase the Notes following a Change of
Control as required by the indenture because we may not have sufficient funds at the time of the
Change of Control or our Senior Credit Facilities may not allow the repurchases.’’

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more
difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer, and, thus, the removal of incumbent
management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial
purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of

121


-----

Control after the Merger is consummated, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the
future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the
ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in
the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.’’ Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived
with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not
contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a
highly leveraged transaction that does not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party approved in
writing by the Issuer makes the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an
Alternate Offer) in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an
Alternate Offer) may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of
Control and such other conditions specified therein, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change
of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party
approved in writing by the Issuer making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described
above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or
such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (except
that such notice may be delivered or mailed more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date or
purchase date if the notice is subject to one or more conditions precedent as described under
‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and Notice’’), given not more than 60 days
following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem (with
respect to the Issuer) or purchase (with respect to a third party) all of the Notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase on a date (the ‘‘Second Change of Control Payment Date’’) at a
price in cash equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of the Second Change of Control
Payment Date, including, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Second Change of Control Payment Date, subject
to the right of Holders of record of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Second Change of Control Payment Date. In
determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a Change of Control Offer,
Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer, by portfolio companies or funds controlled or managed by
any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, or by Debt Fund Affiliates shall be deemed to be
outstanding.

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than any Permitted Holder.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances
there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition
of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it may

122


-----

be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may
require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control
Offer upon a Change of Control may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. A Change of
Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made at the same
time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture,
the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees so long as the tender of Notes by a Holder is not conditioned
upon the delivery of consents by such Holder. In addition, the Issuer or any third party approved in
writing by the Issuer that is making the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, an Alternate Offer) may, subject to applicable law, increase or decrease the Change of Control
Payment (or decline to pay any early tender or similar premium) being offered to Holders at any time
in its sole discretion, so long as the Change of Control Payment is at least equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

**_Selection and Notice_**

With respect to any partial redemption or purchase of Notes made pursuant to the Indenture,
selection of the Notes for redemption or purchase will be made on a pro rata basis to the extent
applicable or by lot or by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate; provided that if
the Notes are represented by global notes, interests in the Notes shall be selected for redemption or
purchase by DTC in accordance with its standard procedures therefor; provided, further, that no Notes
of less than $2,000 can be redeemed or repurchased in part.

Notices of redemption or offers to purchase shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class
mail, postage prepaid, at least 10 days (or such shorter period as is specified solely in respect of a
Special Mandatory Redemption) and not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date or purchase
date to each Holder at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures
of DTC, except that notices of redemption may be delivered or mailed more than 60 days prior to a
Redemption Date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes, a satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture or as specified in the immediately succeeding paragraph. If any Note is
to be redeemed or purchased in part only, any notice of redemption or offer to purchase that relates to
such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be redeemed or
purchased.

Any redemption of, or offer to purchase, the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to
the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including the completion or occurrence of an
Equity Offering, other transaction (or series of related transactions) or an event that constitutes a
Change of Control. If a redemption or purchase is subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, notice of such redemption or purchase may be given in connection with the related Equity
Offering, transaction or event, as the case may be, and prior to the completion or the occurrence
thereof. Such notice shall describe each such condition and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s
discretion, the redemption or purchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than
60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was mailed or delivered, including
by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or such
redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all
such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived, or at any time in the Issuer’s discretion if the
Issuer reasonably believes that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived, in each case
by the redemption or purchase date or by the redemption or purchase date as so delayed. In addition,
the Issuer may provide in any notice of redemption or offer to purchase the Notes that payment of the
redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such
redemption or offer to purchase may be performed by another Person.

123


-----

The Issuer may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture,
and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to
different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different
provisions will have different redemption dates and, with respect to redemptions that occur on the
same date, may specify the order in which such redemptions are deemed to occur.

With respect to Notes represented by certificated notes, if any Notes are to be redeemed or
purchased in part only, the Issuer will issue a new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed
or unpurchased portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of
the original Note; _provided that the new Notes will be only issued in denominations of $2,000 and any_
integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Notes called for redemption or purchase become due on the date fixed for redemption or
purchase, unless such redemption or purchase is conditioned on the happening of a future event. On
and after the redemption or purchase date, unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption or
purchase price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption or
purchase, unless such redemption or purchase remains conditioned on the occurrence of a future event
that has not occurred.

**_Asset Sales_**

From and after the Effective Date, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale unless:

(1) other than in the case of the Specified Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any
other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in connection with
such Asset Sale) at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (measured
at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed
of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap or the Specified Asset Sale, in any such
Asset Sale with a purchase price in excess of the greater of (x) $200.0 million and (y) 15.0% of
Annualized EBITDA (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), at least
75% of the consideration (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) for
such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales completed or contractually agreed upon since
the Effective Date (on a cumulative basis), received (or to be received) by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents.

Within 18 months after the later of (A) the date of any Asset Sale and (B) receipt of any Net
Proceeds from any Asset Sale (the ‘‘Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period’’), the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount equal to the Applicable Percentage of the
Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale (excluding any Net Proceeds from the Specified Asset Sale that are
in excess of $715.0 million) (the ‘‘Applicable Proceeds’’),

(a) to the extent the assets or property disposed of in the Asset Sale constituted Collateral,
to repay (i) Obligations under the Notes, (ii) Obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities or
(iii) any Additional Equal Priority Obligations, and in each case, in the case of revolving
obligations (other than obligations in respect of any asset-based credit facility to the extent the
assets sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant to such Asset Sale constitute ‘‘borrowing base assets’’
thereunder), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

124


-----

(b) to the extent the assets or property disposed of in the Asset Sale did not constitute
Collateral:

(i) to repay (i) Obligations under the Notes, (ii) Obligations under the Senior Credit
Facilities or (iii) any Additional Equal Priority Obligations, and in each case, in the case of
revolving obligations (other than obligations in respect of any asset-based credit facility to the
extent the assets sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant to such Asset Sale constitute
‘‘borrowing base assets’’ thereunder), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect
thereto; _provided that if the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall repay any Obligations_
under the Senior Credit Facilities or Additional Equal Priority Obligations pursuant to
clause (y) or (z) above, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will either (A) reduce the
aggregate principal amount of Obligations under the Notes on a ratable basis with any such
Obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities or Additional Equal Priority Obligations repaid
pursuant to this clause (b)(i) by, at its option, (x) redeeming Notes as provided under
‘‘—Optional Redemption’’ and/or (y) purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or in
privately negotiated transactions (which may be below par) and/or (B) make an offer (in
accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to
purchase their Notes on a ratable basis with any Obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities
or Additional Equal Priority Obligations repaid pursuant to this clause (b)(i) for no less than
100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
thereon (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset Sale Offer for purposes hereof); or

(ii) to repay Obligations under any Senior Indebtedness (other than any Senior
Indebtedness referred to in clause (b)(i) above), and in the case of revolving obligations
(other than obligations in respect of any asset-based credit facility to the extent the assets sold
or otherwise disposed of pursuant to such Asset Sale constitute ‘‘borrowing base assets’’
thereunder), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; provided that the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will either (A) reduce the aggregate principal amount of
Obligations under the Notes on a ratable basis with any such Senior Indebtedness repaid
pursuant to this clause (b)(ii) by, at its option, (x) redeeming Notes as provided under
‘‘—Optional Redemption’’ and/or (y) purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or in
privately negotiated transactions (which may be below par) and/or (B) make an offer (in
accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to
purchase their Notes on a ratable basis with any Senior Indebtedness repaid pursuant to this
clause (b)(ii) for no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset Sale
Offer for purposes hereof);

(c) to invest in the business of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, including (i) any investment in
Additional Assets, (ii) making capital expenditures in respect of assets used or useful in a Similar
Business and (iii) any investment in any property or other assets that replace the businesses,
properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; provided, that the Issuer may elect
to deem expenditures that otherwise would be permissible investments in Additional Assets, capital
expenditures or investments in property or other assets within the scope of the foregoing
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), as applicable, that occur prior to the receipt of the Net Proceeds from
such Asset Sale to have been invested in accordance with this clause (c) (it being agreed that such
deemed expenditure shall have been made no earlier than the earliest of (x) notice of such Asset
Sale, (y) execution of a definitive agreement for such Asset Sale, if applicable, and
(z) consummation of such Asset Sale);

(d) to repay Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Guarantor, and, in the case of revolving obligations (other
than obligations in respect of any asset-based credit facility to the extent the assets sold or

125


-----

otherwise disposed of pursuant to such Asset Sale constitute ‘‘borrowing base assets’’ thereunder),
to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; or

(e) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, in the case of clause (c) above, a binding commitment or letter of intent shall be treated_
as a permitted application of the Applicable Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of
intent so long as the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of
intent with the good faith expectation that such Applicable Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such
commitment or letter of intent within 180 days of the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application
Period (an ‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’) and such Applicable Proceeds are actually applied in such
manner within 180 days of the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (the period
from the consummation of the Asset Sale to such date, the ‘‘Commitment Application Period’’), and, in
the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason after the
expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period and before the Applicable Proceeds are
applied in connection therewith, then such Applicable Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary reasonably expects to enter into another Acceptable
Commitment prior to the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period and such Applicable
Proceeds are actually applied in such manner prior to the expiration of the Commitment Application
Period. To the extent Applicable Proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed amounts that are invested or
applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph, such excess
amount will be deemed to constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’; provided that any amount of Applicable
Proceeds offered to Holders of any Notes pursuant to clause (b) of the preceding paragraph shall not
be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to whether such offer is accepted by any Holders. If
at any time the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $150.0 million, then the Issuer shall
within 20 Business Days make an offer to all Holders and, if required or permitted by the terms of any
other Equal Priority Obligations and/or, to the extent that the assets or property disposed of in the
Asset Sale were not Collateral, Indebtedness that is pari passu in right of payment with the Notes
(‘‘Pari Passu Indebtedness’’), to the holders of such Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as applicable (an ‘‘Asset Sale Offer’’), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal
amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari
Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, out of the amount of the Excess Proceeds (which, (x) in the case of
the Notes only, is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof and at an offer price in cash in an
amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the date fixed for the repurchase of such Notes pursuant to such offer, in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Indenture and (y) in the case of such Equal Priority Obligations and/or
Pari Passu Indebtedness, if applicable, is in accordance with the documents governing such Equal
Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable). The Issuer will commence an Asset
Sale Offer by sending the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the
Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to such Applicable Proceeds from
an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture
(an ‘‘Advance Offer’’) with respect to all or part of the available Applicable Proceeds (the ‘‘Advance
_Portion’’)._

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable,
Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is
less than the Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer
may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in
any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as
applicable) of Notes or the Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered
pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance
Offer, the Advance Portion), the Notes shall be selected pro rata (subject to applicable DTC

-----

procedures as to global notes) and the Issuer or the representative of such Equal Priority Obligations
and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness shall select such Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be purchased or repaid on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal
amount of the Notes and such Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered,
with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Equal Priority Obligations and/or Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon
completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero
(regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion), and in the case
of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess
Proceeds.

Pending the final application of an amount equal to the Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this
covenant, the holder of such Applicable Proceeds may apply any Applicable Proceeds temporarily to
reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility (including under the Senior Credit
Facilities) or otherwise invest such Applicable Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.
The Issuer (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to invest in Additional Assets
prior to receiving the Applicable Proceeds attributable to any given Asset Sale (provided that such
investment shall be made no earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the relevant Asset
Sale, execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Sale and consummation of the relevant
Asset Sale) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with the
second paragraph of this covenant with respect to such Asset Sale. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Holder of any Retained Asset Sale Proceeds may apply any Retained Asset Sale Proceeds in any
manner not prohibited by the Indenture and such Retained Asset Sale Proceeds shall in no event and
under no circumstances constitute Excess Proceeds.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, for so long as the repatriation,
distribution or dividend to the Issuer of any Net Proceeds of an Asset Sale by a Restricted Subsidiary
that is not a Guarantor would (i) be prohibited, delayed or restricted under any Requirements of Law
or conflict with the fiduciary duties of the directors of the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor, or result in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a material risk of personal or
criminal liability for any officer, director, employee, manager, member of management, member,
partner, independent contractor or consultant of such Restricted Subsidiary (the Issuer hereby agreeing
to cause the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to promptly take all commercially
reasonable actions available under applicable Requirements of Law to permit such repatriation or to
remove such prohibition); (ii) be prohibited, delayed or restricted under the organizational documents
governing the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; or (iii) as determined in good
faith by the Issuer, result in a material adverse tax liability (including any tax dividend, deemed
dividend pursuant to Section 956 of the Code and withholding tax obligation) to the Issuer or its
Subsidiaries or any Parent Companies, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so
affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant and shall not constitute
Excess Proceeds and may be retained by the Issuer or the applicable Subsidiary; provided, that, if within
18 months following the date on which application of the portion of such Net Proceeds would
otherwise have been required pursuant to this covenant, such repatriation, distribution or dividend of
such Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable Requirements of Law, would no longer conflict
with the fiduciary duties of such director, or result in, or be reasonably expected to result in, a material
risk of personal or criminal liability for the Persons described above, would no longer be prohibited,
delayed or restricted under the applicable organizational documents and/or in the good faith
determination of the Issuer would no longer have a material adverse tax liability, then such portion of
the Net Proceeds shall be promptly applied (net of additional taxes that would be payable or reserved
against as a result of repatriating such amounts) in compliance with this covenant.

127


-----

For purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant (and no other provision), the
following shall be deemed to be cash or Cash Equivalents:

(1) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected
on the most recent balance sheet of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or in the footnotes
thereto, or if incurred, accrued or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such
liabilities that would have been reflected on the balance sheet of the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence, accrual or increase had taken place on or
prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, that are assumed by the transferee of any such
assets (or are otherwise extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset
Sale) pursuant to a written agreement which releases or indemnifies the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such liabilities;

(2) the amount of any trade-in value applied to the purchase price of any replacement assets
acquired in connection with such Asset Sale;

(3) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by the Issuer
acting in good faith to be converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash or Cash Equivalents (to the
extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the
closing of such Asset Sale; and

(4) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received in respect of such Asset Sale having an
aggregate fair market value (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value), taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (4) that is outstanding at such time, not
in excess of the greater of $300.0 million and 20.0% of Annualized EBITDA of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, shall be deemed to be cash.

To the extent that any portion of Applicable Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is
denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes
shall not exceed the net amount of funds in dollars that is actually received by the Issuer upon
converting such portion into U.S. dollars.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the asset sale provisions
of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not
be deemed to have breached its obligations under the asset sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of
such compliance.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent
of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. An Asset
Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an
amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees so long as
the tender of the Notes by a Holder is not conditioned upon the delivery of consents by such Holder.

The Senior Credit Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to
Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or any of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain
change of control events (including events constituting a Change of Control under the Indenture) with

128


-----

respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder or result in a requirement to offer to
repurchase the Indebtedness governed by such agreement, including the Unsecured Notes Indenture. If
the Issuer experiences a change of control that triggers such a default or results in a requirement to
offer to repurchase the Indebtedness governed by such agreement, we may seek a waiver of such
default or seek to refinance the Indebtedness governed by such agreement. In the event we do not
obtain such a waiver or are unable to refinance or otherwise repurchase such indebtedness as required
by the applicable agreement, such default would result in all amounts outstanding under such
agreement being declared due and payable, which could in turn result in an Event of Default under the
Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Effectiveness of Covenants_**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants to be contained in the Indenture. If on any
date following the Effective Date, (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from two of three
Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the
occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as
a ‘‘Covenant Suspension Event’’), then beginning on such date and continuing until the Reversion Date
(as defined below), the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following
covenants (collectively, the ‘‘Suspended Covenants’’):

(1) ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales;’’

(2) ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments;’’

(3) ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock;’’

(4) clause (d) of the first paragraph and the entire third paragraph of ‘‘—Merger,
Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets;’’

(5) ‘‘—Transactions with Affiliates;’’

(6) ‘‘—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries;’’ and

(7) ‘‘—Additional Note Guarantees.’’

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended
Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any
subsequent date (the ‘‘Reversion Date’’) the rating assigned to the Notes by two of three of the Rating
Agencies is below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will
thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future
events.

The period of time between (and including) the date of the Covenant Suspension Event and the
Reversion Date (but excluding the Reversion Date) is referred to in this description as the ‘‘Suspension
_Period.’’ The Note Guarantees of the Guarantors will be suspended and/or released during the_
Suspension Period. In the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by
the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or
Event of Default with respect to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture; provided that, (1) with
respect to Restricted Payments made on or after the Reversion Date and the capacity to make
Restricted Payments, the amount of Restricted Payments made and the capacity to make Restricted
Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Limitation on
Restricted Payments’’ had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with
respect to a Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) and accordingly,

129


-----

Restricted Payments made or deemed to be made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the
amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation
on Restricted Payments’’, including clause (2) of the first paragraph thereof, (2) all Indebtedness
incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period (or deemed
incurred or issued in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the
Suspension Period) will be deemed to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (j) of the second
paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock,’’ (3) no Subsidiaries shall be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during any
Suspension Period, unless such designation would have complied with the covenant described under the
caption ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ as if such covenant was in effect for the purposes of
designating Unrestricted Subsidiaries from the Effective Date to the date of such designation, (4) any
Affiliate Transaction entered into on or after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered
into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (e) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Transactions with Affiliates,’’ (5) any
encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take
any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under
‘‘—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries’’ that becomes effective
during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (i) of the covenant
described under ‘‘—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ and
(6) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with a Limited
Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made
pursuant to clause (f) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investments.’’ On the Reversion Date, the amount
of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Upon any Reversion Date, the obligation to grant Note
Guarantees pursuant to the covenant described below under ‘‘—Additional Note Guarantees’’ will be
reinstated and such Reversion Date will be deemed to be the date on which any guaranteed
Indebtedness was incurred for purposes of such covenant, such that a Restricted Subsidiary shall have
60 days from such Reversion Date to provide a Note Guarantee that would have been required to have
been provided during the Suspension Period had such covenant not been suspended.

During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur
Liens permitted under ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’ (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens). To the
extent such covenant and any Permitted Liens refer to one or more Suspended Covenants, such
covenant or definition shall be interpreted as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued
to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for purposes of the ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’
covenant and the ‘‘Permitted Liens’’ definition and for no other covenant).

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no
Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist or have occurred under the
Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Indenture with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of
the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring
during the Suspension Period (including any Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the
Suspension Period), or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation entered
into or arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the
Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or
after that time, as a result of any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period),
and (2) following a Reversion Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted,
without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any
contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby (including any Limited Condition Transaction entered into during
the Suspension Period).

We cannot assure you that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

130


-----

If the Suspended Covenants are suspended for any period as described above, the Holders will be
entitled to substantially less covenant protection. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness
and the Notes—Many of the covenants in the indentures that will govern the notes will be suspended if
the notes have investment grade ratings from any two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch.’’

Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall have any duty to monitor, inquire as to
or ascertain compliance with the covenants described below.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

From and after the Effective Date, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to:

(I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the
Issuer’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (in each case, solely to a holder of
Equity Interests in such Person’s capacity as a holder of such Equity Interests), including any
dividend or distribution payable in connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation
other than:

or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend, payment or
distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities;

(II) redeem, purchase, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity
Interests of the Issuer or any Parent Company, including in connection with any merger,

(III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, purchase, repurchase, defease, discharge or
otherwise acquire or retire for value, in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund

the foregoing (subject to the exceptions in clauses (a) and (b) below), ‘‘Restricted Debt Payments’’),
other than:

(a) Indebtedness permitted to be incurred or issued under clause (c) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock;’’ or

(b) the prepayment, redemption, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, discharge or other
acquisition or retirement of Subordinated Indebtedness in anticipation of satisfying a sinking
fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the

retirement; or

(IV) make any Restricted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in
clauses (I) through (IV) above (other than any exceptions thereto) being collectively referred to as
‘‘Restricted Payments’’), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment:

(1) in the case of a Restricted Payment under any of clauses (I), (II) and (III) above
(other than with respect to amounts attributable to subclauses (a)(i) and (a)(iii) through (a)(x)

of clause (2) below), no Event of Default described under clause (1), (2) or (6) of the first
paragraph of ‘‘—Events of Default and Remedies’’ shall have occurred and be continuing or
would occur as a consequence thereof; and

(2) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted
Payments made by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Effective Date pursuant

or any Subsidiary Guarantor, unless:

(1) in the case of Subject Liens on any Collateral, (i) such Subject Lien expressly has Junior
Lien Priority on the Collateral relative to the Notes and the Note Guarantees or (ii) such Subject
Lien is a Permitted Lien; and

(2) in the case of any Subject Lien on any asset or property that is not Collateral, (i) the
Notes (or the related Note Guarantee in the case of Liens on assets or property of a Subsidiary

secures Subordinated Indebtedness, on a senior basis to) the Obligations secured by such Subject
Lien until such time as such Obligations are no longer secured by such Subject Lien or (ii) such
Subject Lien is a Permitted Lien.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to clause (2) of the preceding paragraph
shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged upon the release and discharge of the Subject Lien that gave rise to the obligation to secure
the Notes. In addition, in the event that a Subject Lien is or becomes a Permitted Lien, the Issuer may,
at its option and without consent from any Holder, elect to release and discharge any Lien created for
the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph in respect of such Subject Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at
the time of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any
Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The ‘‘Increased Amount’’ of any Indebtedness shall mean any
increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of
accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of
additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation
preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in

extent providing analysis of investment in the Notes) or any market maker in the Notes, in each case,
who agrees to treat such information as confidential or accesses such information and reports on such
password-protected website or online data system which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment;
_provided that the Issuer shall post such information and reports thereon and make readily available any_
password or other login information to any such Holder of the Notes, bona fide prospective investor,
securities analyst or market maker; provided, further, that the Issuer may deny access to any
competitively-sensitive information or reports otherwise to be provided pursuant to this paragraph to
any such Holder, bona fide prospective investor, security analyst or market maker that is a competitor

161


-----

of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries to the extent that the Issuer determines in good faith that the
provision of such information or reports to such Person would be competitively harmful to the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries; and provided, further, that such Holders, bona fide prospective investors, security
analysts or market makers shall agree to (i) treat all such reports (and the information contained
therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and the information contained
therein for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (iii) not
publicly disclose any such reports (and the information contained therein).

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will also:

(1) after:

(i) furnishing to the Holders the annual and quarterly information and reports required
by clause (1) of the first paragraph of this ‘‘Reports and Other Information’’ covenant or

(ii) furnishing to the Holders, at the option and in the sole discretion of the Issuer (who
shall not be obligated to so furnish), a summary condensed consolidated annual or quarterly
income statement and balance sheet, as applicable, without notes thereto, and a summary
discussion of the results of operations for the relevant reporting period,

promptly hold a conference call to discuss such information and reports or summary information
and the results of operations for the relevant reporting period (which conference call, for the
avoidance of doubt, may be held prior to such time that the annual or quarterly information and
reports required by clause (1) of the first paragraph of this ‘‘Reports and Other Information’’
covenant are furnished to Holders); and

(2) announce by press release to the appropriate nationally recognized wire services or post
to the website of the Issuer (or any Parent Company) or on a non-public, password-protected
website or online data system maintained by the Issuer (or any Parent Company) or a third party
prior to the date of the conference call required to be held in accordance with clause (1) of this
paragraph, the time and date of such conference call and either including all information necessary
to access the call or informing Holders, bona fide prospective investors, market makers and
securities analysts how they can obtain such information.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to prospective investors, upon their request, any information
required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so long as the Notes are
not freely transferable under the Securities Act.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the sole remedy for an Event of Default
relating to the failure to comply with the reporting obligations described under this covenant, will for
the 365 days after the occurrence of such Event of Default consist exclusively, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, of the right to receive additional interest on the principal amount of the Notes at a
rate equal to 0.50% per annum. This additional interest will be payable in the same manner and
subject to the same terms as other interest payable under the Indenture. This additional interest will
accrue on all outstanding Notes from and including the date on which an Event of Default relating to a
failure to comply with the reporting obligations described above this covenant first occurs to, but
excluding the 365th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which the Event of Default relating to such
reporting obligations is cured or waived). If the Event of Default resulting from such failure to comply
with the reporting obligations is continuing on such 365th day, such additional interest will cease to
accrue and the Notes will be subject to the other remedies provided under the heading ‘‘—Events of
Default and Remedies.’’

162


-----

Any Parent Company may satisfy the obligations of the Issuer set forth in this ‘‘Reports and Other
Information’’ covenant by providing the requisite financial and other information of such Parent
Company instead of the Issuer; provided that if such Parent Company is not a Guarantor, to the extent
such Parent Company holds assets (other than its direct or indirect interest in the Issuer) that exceeds
the lesser of (i) 1% of the Consolidated Total Assets of such Parent Company and (ii) 1% of the total
revenue for the preceding fiscal year of such Parent Company, then such information related to such
Parent Company shall be accompanied by consolidating information, which may be posted to the
website of the Issuer (or any Parent Company) or on a non-public, password-protected website or
online data system maintained by the Issuer (or any Parent Company) or a third party, that explains in
reasonable detail the differences between the information of such Parent Company, on the one hand,
and the information relating to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other
hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the
preceding sentence need not be audited or reviewed by the auditors.

The Issuer will be deemed to have furnished the financial statements and other information
referred to in the first paragraph of this covenant if the Issuer or any Parent Company has filed reports
containing such information (or any such information of a Parent Company in accordance with the
immediately preceding paragraph) with the SEC.

**_Additional Note Guarantees_**

From and after the Effective Date, the Issuer will not permit any of its Domestic Subsidiaries that
is a Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Guarantors and any Receivables Subsidiary)
to (i) borrow or guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities,
(ii) guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness under any Credit Facility incurred by the Issuer or any
Guarantor under clause (1) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ in an aggregate principal amount
in excess of $350.0 million, or (iii) guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness under any other capital
markets debt securities of the Issuer or any Guarantor in an aggregate principal amount in excess of
$350.0 million, unless such Subsidiary within 60 days executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to
the Indenture providing for a Note Guarantee by such Subsidiary and joinders to the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement, any Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement or Acceptable Junior Priority
Intercreditor Agreement and applicable Security Documents or new intercreditor agreements and
Security Documents, together with any filings and agreements to the extent required by (and within the
time periods as set forth in) the Security Documents to create or perfect the security interests for the
benefit of the Holders in the Collateral of such Subsidiary; _provided that this covenant shall not be_
applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a
Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person
becoming a Restricted Subsidiary. The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary
that is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, (and no 60-day period
described in the foregoing sentence shall apply to such Subsidiary).

Each Note Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture
described under ‘‘Note Guarantees.’’

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following events is an ‘‘Event of Default’’ under the Indenture:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of
principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the
Notes;

163


-----

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after receipt of written
notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding (with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or
agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) or (2) above) contained in the
Indenture or the Notes; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture
provisions described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,’’ such period
of continuance of such default or breach shall be 180 days after written notice described in this
clause (3) has been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by
which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, any
Permitted Receivables Financing or, with respect to Indebtedness consisting of Hedging
Obligations, termination events or equivalent events pursuant to the terms of the relevant Hedge
Agreement which are not the result of any default thereunder by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of
the Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness
at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an
obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated
final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such
Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated final maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, is in the aggregate equal to $200.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent);

(5) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary (other
than any Receivables Subsidiary) (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as determined
as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end
provided as required under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information’’) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other than any Receivables Subsidiary) to pay final
non-appealable judgments aggregating in excess of $200.0 million (to the extent not covered by
insurance as to which the insurer has been notified of such judgment or order and has not denied
its obligation), which final non-appealable judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed
for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final and non-appealable, and, in
the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced
by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary (other than any Receivables Subsidiary) (or
group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as determined as of the most recent consolidated
financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Reports and Other Information’’) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other than
any Receivables Subsidiary) (the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’);

(7) any Note Guarantee of Holdings or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant
Subsidiary (or group of Subsidiary Guarantors that together (as determined as of the most recent
consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information’’) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary) ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such

164


-----

Note Guarantee) or Holdings or any such Subsidiary Guarantor or such group of Subsidiary
Guarantors denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee (other than by reason of
the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture and discharge of the Indenture or the
release of such Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture);

(8) the failure by the Merger Sub to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption, to the
extent required, as described under ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption;’’

(9) (i) the Liens created by the Security Documents shall at any time not constitute a valid
and perfected Lien on any material portion of the Collateral intended to be covered thereby
(unless perfection is not required by the Indenture or the Security Documents) other than (A) in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document and the Indenture, (B) the
satisfaction in full of all Obligations under the Indenture or (C) any loss of perfection that results
from the failure of the Controlling Collateral Agent or Notes Collateral Agent to maintain
possession of certificates delivered to it representing securities pledged under the Security
Documents or to file Uniform Commercial Code continuation statements and (ii) such default
continues for 30 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less
than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes; or

(10) the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of
Subsidiary Guarantors that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer
for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other
Information’’ would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall assert, in any pleading in any court of
competent jurisdiction, that any security interest in any material Security Document is invalid or
unenforceable (other than by reason of the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the
Indenture and discharge of the Indenture, the release of the Note Guarantee of such Subsidiary
Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the release of such security interest in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Security Documents).

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above with respect to the
Issuer) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in
aggregate principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if
any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and
payable immediately. Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, a notice of Default
may not be given with respect to any action taken, any inaction that occurred or any event that took
place and, in each case, was either reported publicly or reported to Holders, more than two years prior
to such notice of Default.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable
immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6)
of the first paragraph of this section with respect to the Issuer, the principal of and interest on all
outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. If a Default occurs
and is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must send to each Holder notice of
the Default within 90 days after it becomes known to the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that the
Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to
the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it in good faith determines that withholding
notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in
the reasonable judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the interest of the Holders.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive
any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing
Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any

165


-----

Note held by a non-consenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration and its consequences; provided
such rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all
consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of
the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee
or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been
discharged; or

(2) the requisite holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action
(as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case
an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of
the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless the
Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against
any loss, liability or expense. Subject to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, and except to
enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder
may pursue any remedy with respect to the Notes or the Indenture unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Notes
have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy;

(3) Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof
and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the total then outstanding Notes
have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

These limitations do not apply, however, to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note for the
enforcement of payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Note on or after the
respective due date expressed in such Note.

Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of
Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a ‘‘Noteholder Direction’’) provided by any one
or more Holders (each a ‘‘Directing Holder’’) must be accompanied by a written representation from
each such Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is
DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net
Short (a ‘‘Position Representation’’), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating
to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is
cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder
must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other
information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of
such Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a ‘‘Verification
_Covenant’’). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or_
Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu
of DTC or its nominee.

166


-----

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the
Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe that a Directing Holder was,
at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that the Issuer has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a
determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation,
and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction,
the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and
non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the
delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to
the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant,
the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with
respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be
automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant.
Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such
Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the
percentage of the Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would
have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be
void _ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred,_
acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or
any notice of such Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder
Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a
bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraph.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder
Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or
investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification
Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make
calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long
Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability to
the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction.

Subject to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement and certain other restrictions, the Holders of
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or
of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow
any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability.

The Issuer will be required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal
year (beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Effective Date and after giving effect to any
fiscal year end change effected on or after the Effective Date), an Officer’s Certificate indicating
whether the signer of the certificate knows of any failure by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to
comply with all conditions and covenants of the Indenture during such fiscal year. In addition, the
Issuer is required within 30 days of becoming aware of any Default to deliver to the Trustee a
statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or waived within such 30-day
time period).

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with another default (such other default, the ‘‘Initial Default’’) occurs,
then at the time such Initial Default is cured, the Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action

167


-----

and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed
under ‘‘—Reports and Other Information’’ or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to
any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report
required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not
within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Any time period in the Indenture to cure any
actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Managers, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or
stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any of their parent companies or entities, as such, shall
have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Note
Guarantees, the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement, the Equal Priority Intercreditor, any Junior Priority
Intercreditor Agreement or Acceptable Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement or any Security
Document or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation.
Each Holder by accepting Notes waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part
of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities
under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public
policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture, the Notes, the applicable
Security Documents and the Note Guarantees, will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will
be released upon payment in full of all of the Notes issued under the Indenture. The Issuer may, at its
option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the Notes and the
applicable Security Documents and have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its
Note Guarantee, and have Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes released (‘‘Legal Defeasance’’)
and cure all then existing Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust
created pursuant to the Indenture;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an
office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral
Agent, and the Issuer’s obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of
each Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are set forth
in the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees, as the case may be (‘‘Covenant Defeasance’’), and
thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default or Event of
Default. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy,
receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Issuer) described under ‘‘Events of
Default and Remedies’’ will no longer constitute an Event of Default.

168


-----

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the
Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination
thereof, in such amounts (including scheduled payments thereon) as will be sufficient, in the
opinion of an Independent Financial Advisor, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest
due on the Notes on the stated maturity date or on the Redemption Date, as the case may be, of
such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes and the Issuer must specify whether
such Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular Redemption Date; provided that upon
any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall
be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the
Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium, calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption,
with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the ‘‘Applicable Premium Deficit’’)
only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee
simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion
of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions
and exclusions,

(a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the United States
Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or

(b) since the issuance of the Notes, there has been a change in the applicable U.S.
federal income tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that,
subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders of the Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not
occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions, the Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be
applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other
Indebtedness, and, in each case the granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have occurred
and be continuing on the date of such deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation
of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or material instrument (other than the
Indenture) to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any
Guarantor is bound (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such
deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case,
the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

169


-----

(6) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the
deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding
any creditors of the Issuer or any Guarantor or others; and

(7) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each
stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the
Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes and the
Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes will be released, when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except mutilated, destroyed, lost
or stolen Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has
theretofore been deposited in trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) (w) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise,
(ii) will become due and payable within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption
within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of
notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer;

(x) the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited
with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes,
cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, in an
amount (including scheduled payments thereon) sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
Indebtedness on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for
principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of
Notes which have become due and payable) or to the date of maturity or redemption, as
the case may be; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the
Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the
Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the
Applicable Premium, calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any
Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to
the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable
Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied
toward such redemption;

(y) no Default or Event of Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds
to be applied to make such deposit or any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to

have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or shall occur as a result of
such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under any material agreement or material instrument (other than the Indenture)
to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor
is bound (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such
deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in
each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith); and

(9) make any change to or modify the ranking of the Notes that would adversely affect the

portion of the Collateral in any way materially adverse, taken as a whole, to the Holders, other than, in
each case, as provided under the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, any Guarantor (with respect to its Note Guarantee, the
Indenture, the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, any Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement or
Acceptable Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents to which it is a party
and excluding any amendment or supplement the sole purpose of which is to add an additional
Guarantor), the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, without the consent of any Holders, may

conferred upon the Issuer or any Guarantor;

173


-----

restructuring, replacement, supplementing or other modification from time to time of the Senior
Credit Facilities or any other agreement that is not prohibited by the Indenture.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, the Notes held by all Debt Fund
Affiliates shall not account for more than 49.9% of the principal amounts of outstanding Notes
included in determining whether the Holders have (A) consented to any amendment, modification,
waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of the Indenture therefrom,
(B) otherwise acted on any matter related to the Indenture or (C) directed or required the Trustee to
undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under the Indenture; it
being understood and agreed that the portion of the Notes that accounts for more than 49.9% of the
relevant requisite principal amount of outstanding Notes shall be deemed to be not outstanding for all
such purposes.

**Notices**

Notices given by publication (including posting of information as contemplated by the provisions
described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information’’) will be deemed given on the
first date on which publication is made and notices given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, will be
deemed given five calendar days after mailing or transmitting. Notices sent by overnight delivery service
will be deemed given on the next Business Day after timely delivery to the courier and notices given
electronically will be deemed given when sent. Notice otherwise given in accordance with the
procedures of DTC will be deemed given on the date sent to DTC.

**Concerning the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral
Agent, should it become a creditor of the Issuer or a Guarantor, to obtain payment of claims in certain
cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise.
The Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however,
if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for
permission to continue or resign as Trustee or Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable,
subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default shall occur
(which shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree
of care of a prudent person under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Neither the
Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of their rights or
powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless such Holder shall have offered to the
Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent security and indemnity reasonably satisfactory to them against
any loss, liability or expense.

The Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee shall execute the Security Documents, the Equal
Priority Intercreditor Agreement, any intercreditor agreement having substantially similar terms with
respect to the Holders as set those set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, taken as a
whole, any Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, any Acceptable Junior Priority Intercreditor
Agreement or any joinder with respect to any of the foregoing upon the receipt of an Officer’s
Certificate stating that such execution and delivery is permitted by the Indenture and all conditions
precedent relating to such execution and delivery have been satisfied.

174


-----

By their acceptance of the Notes, the Holders will be deemed to have authorized the Notes
Collateral Agent to enter into and to perform each of the Security Documents, the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement and, if applicable, any Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement or Acceptable
Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, including any amendments or supplements thereto permitted
by the Indenture.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Escrow Agreement will be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

**Limited Condition Transactions**

In connection with any action being taken solely in connection with a Limited Condition
Transaction, for purposes of:

(a) determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture that requires the calculation
of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, Consolidated First Lien Debt
Ratio or Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio;

(b) determining whether a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
(or any subset of Defaults or Events of Default); or

(c) testing availability under baskets, ratios or financial metrics under the Indenture
(including those measured as a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA, Annualized EBITDA, Fixed
Charges or Consolidated Total Assets or by reference to clause (2)(a) of the first paragraph under
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’);

in each case, at the option of the Issuer, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, a Parent Company of the
Issuer, or any successor entity of any of the foregoing (including a third party) (the ‘‘Testing Party’’, and
the election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction, an ‘‘LCT
_Election’’), with such option to be exercised on or prior to the date of execution of the definitive_
agreements, submission of notice or the making of a definitive declaration, as applicable, with respect
to such Limited Condition Transaction, the date of determination of whether any such action is
permitted under the Indenture, shall be deemed to be (a) the date the definitive agreements (or, if
applicable, a binding offer or launch of a ‘‘certain funds’’ tender offer), notice (which may be
conditional) or declaration with respect to such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into,
provided or made, as applicable, or the date that an Officer’s Certificate is given with respect to the
designation of a Subsidiary as restricted or unrestricted, or (b) with respect to sales in connection with
an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers applies (or similar
law or practice in other jurisdictions), the date on which a ‘‘Rule 2.7 announcement’’ of a firm intent to
make an offer or similar announcement or determination in another jurisdiction subject to laws similar
to the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (as applicable, the ‘‘LCT Test Date’’) is
made, and if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and the other
transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness or
Liens and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the most recent Test
Period ending prior to the LCT Test Date, the Issuer could have taken such action on the relevant LCT
Test Date in compliance with such ratio, basket or financial metric, such ratio, basket or financial
metric shall be deemed to have been complied with.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Testing Party has made an LCT Election and any of the ratios,
baskets or financial metrics for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date
are exceeded or not complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, basket or financial
metrics, including due to fluctuations in Fixed Charges, Consolidated Net Income or Annualized

175


-----

EBITDA of the Issuer, the target company or the Person subject to such Limited Condition
Transaction, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such ratios, baskets
or financial metrics will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations and such
baskets, ratios or financial metrics shall not be tested at the consummation of the Limited Condition
Transaction except as contemplated in clause (a) of the immediately succeeding proviso; provided,
_however, that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become_
available, the Testing Party may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine all such baskets, ratios and
financial metrics on the basis of such financial statements, in which case such date of redetermination
shall thereafter be deemed to be the applicable LCT Test Date, (b) if any ratios or financial metrics
improve or baskets increase as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios, financial metrics or
baskets may be utilized and (c) Fixed Charges with respect to any Indebtedness expected to be incurred
in connection with such Limited Condition Transaction will, for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, be calculated using an assumed interest rate based on the available documentation therefor, as
determined by the Testing Party in good faith. If the Testing Party has made an LCT Election for any
Limited Condition Transaction, then, in connection with any subsequent calculation of the ratios,
baskets or financial metrics on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of
(i) the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or (ii) the date that the
definitive agreement, notice or declaration for such Limited Condition Transaction is abandoned,
terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio,
basket or financial metric shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming such Limited Condition
Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness
or Liens and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
Testing Party has exercised its option pursuant to the foregoing and any Default or Event of Default
occurs following the LCT Test Date (including any new LCT Test Date) for the applicable Limited
Condition Transaction and prior to or on the date of the consummation of such Limited Condition
Transaction, any such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be
continuing for purposes of determining whether any action being taken in connection with such Limited
Condition Transaction is permitted under the Indenture.

**Certain Compliance Determinations**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the succeeding two paragraphs in
this section and ‘‘Limited Condition Transactions’’ above, all financial ratios, tests, covenants,
calculations and measurements (including, without limitation, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Interest Expense, Fixed Charges, Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated Total Assets,
Consolidated EBITDA, Annualized EBITDA, any Fixed Amount (as defined below) or IncurrenceBased Amount (as defined below)) contained in the Indenture that are calculated with respect to any
period during which the Transactions or any Subject Transaction occurs shall be calculated with respect
to such period and the Transactions and each such Subject Transaction on a pro forma basis and may
be determined with reference to the financial statements of a Parent Company of the Issuer instead, so
long as such Parent Company does not hold any material assets other than, directly or indirectly, the
Equity Interests of the Issuer (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or senior
management of the Issuer (or any Parent Company of the Issuer)). Further, if, since the beginning of
any such period and on or prior to the date of any required calculation of any financial ratio, test,
covenant, calculation or measurement (i) any Subject Transaction has occurred or (ii) any Person that
subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into
the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any joint venture since the beginning of such period
has consummated any Subject Transaction, then, in each case, any applicable financial ratio, test,
covenant, calculation or measurement shall be calculated on a pro forma basis for such period as if
such Subject Transaction (including, without duplication of any amounts otherwise reflected in

176


-----

Consolidated EBITDA for the applicable Test Period, any Run Rate Benefits and the ‘‘run rate’’
income described, and calculated as set forth, in clause (e)(i) of the definition of Consolidated
EBITDA) had occurred at the beginning of the applicable period.

For purposes of determining the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event that
requires a calculation of any Fixed Amounts, Incurrence-Based Amounts or financial ratio, test
covenant, calculation or measurement (including, without limitation, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Interest Expense, Fixed Charges, Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated Total Assets,
Consolidated EBITDA and Annualized EBITDA), such Fixed Amounts, Incurrence-Based Amounts or
financial ratio, test, covenant, calculation or measurement shall be calculated at the time such action is
taken (subject to ‘‘—Limited Condition Transactions’’ above), such change is made, such transaction is
consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be, and no Default or Event of Default shall be
deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in such Fixed Amounts, Incurrence-Based
Amounts or financial ratio, test, covenant, calculation or measurement occurring after the time such
action is taken, such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case
may be.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, with respect to any amounts incurred
or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Indenture (including
any covenant) that does not require compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, without
limitation, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, Consolidated First Lien
Debt Ratio and/or Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) (any such amounts, the ‘‘Fixed Amounts’’)
substantially concurrently with any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in
reliance on a provision of the Indenture that requires compliance with a financial ratio or test
(including, without limitation, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio,
Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio and/or Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) (any such amounts, the
‘‘Incurrence-Based Amounts’’), it is understood and agreed that the Fixed Amounts shall be disregarded
in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to the Incurrence-Based Amounts.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, in the event an item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is
incurred or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on an Incurrence-Based Amount, such
Incurrence-Based Amount shall be calculated without regard to the incurrence of any Indebtedness
under any revolving facility or letter of credit facility (i) immediately prior to or in connection
therewith or (ii) used to finance working capital needs of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as
reasonably determined by the Issuer).

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, so long as an action was taken (or not
taken) in reliance upon a basket, ratio or test under the Indenture that was calculated or determined in
good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer based upon financial
information available to such officer at such time and such action (or inaction) was permitted under
the Indenture at the time of such calculation or determination, any subsequent restatement,
modification or adjustments made to such financial information (including any restatement,
modification or adjustment that would have caused such basket, ratio or test to be exceeded as a result
of such action or inaction) shall not result in any Default or Event of Default under the Indenture.

For purposes of determining compliance at any time with the covenants under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock,’’ ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted
Payments,’’ ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries,’’ ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,’’ ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Transactions with Affiliates’’ and the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investments,’’ in the event that any

177


-----

Indebtedness, Permitted Lien, Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment, disposition or Affiliate
Transaction, as applicable, meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of transactions or
items permitted pursuant to the first paragraph or any clause of the second paragraph under
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock’’ (provided that all Indebtedness represented by term loans outstanding under the
Senior Credit Facilities on the Effective Date (after giving effect to the Transactions) will be treated as
incurred on the Effective Date under clause (a) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock’’), any clause of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens’’, clause (2) of the first paragraph or any
clause of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,’’ any
clause of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Dividend and Other Payment
Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ any clause of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investment’’,
any clause of the definition of ‘‘Asset Sale’’ and any dispositions constituting exceptions thereto and any
clause under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Transactions with Affiliates’’, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, may,
from time to time, classify or reclassify such transaction or item (or portion thereof) and will only be
required to include the amount and type of such transaction (or portion thereof) in any one category;
_provided that the reclassification described in this sentence shall be deemed to have occurred_
automatically with respect to any such transaction or item incurred or made pursuant to a Fixed
Amount that later would be permitted on a pro forma basis to be incurred or made pursuant to an
Incurrence-Based Amount. It is understood and agreed that any Indebtedness, Permitted Lien,
Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment, disposition and/or Affiliate Transaction need not be
permitted solely by reference to one category of permitted Indebtedness, Permitted Lien, Restricted
Payment, Permitted Investment, disposition and/or Affiliate Transaction under such sections,
respectively, but may instead be permitted in part under any combination thereof.

For purposes of any determination under the Indenture (other than the calculation of compliance
with any financial ratio for purposes of taking any action under the Indenture) with respect to the
amount of any Indebtedness, Lien, Restricted Payment, Restricted Debt Payment, Investment, Asset
Sale, Sale and Lease-Back Transaction, Affiliate transaction or other transaction, event or circumstance,
or any determination under any other provision of the Indenture (any of the foregoing, a ‘‘specified
_transaction’’) requiring the use of a current exchange rate, (i) the equivalent amount in U.S. dollars of_
a specified transaction in a currency other than U.S. dollars shall be calculated based on the rate of
exchange quoted by the Bloomberg Foreign Exchange Rates & World Currencies Page (or any
successor page thereto, or in the event such rate does not appear on any Bloomberg Page, by reference
to such other publicly available service for displaying exchange rates as may be determined by the
Issuer in good faith) for such foreign currency (the ‘‘Exchange Rate’’), as in effect at 11:00 a.m.
(London time) on the date of such determination (which, in the case of any Restricted Payment, shall
be deemed to be the date of the declaration thereof and, in the case of the incurrence of Indebtedness,
shall be deemed to be on the date first committed); _provided, that if any Indebtedness is incurred (and,_
if applicable, associated Lien granted) to refinance or replace other Indebtedness denominated in a
currency other than U.S. dollars, and the relevant refinancing or replacement would cause the
applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency
Exchange Rate in effect on the date of such refinancing or replacement, such U.S. dollar-denominated
restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such
refinancing or replacement Indebtedness (and, if applicable, associated Lien granted) does not exceed
an amount sufficient to repay the principal amount of the Refinanced Indebtedness, except by an
amount equal to (x) unpaid accrued interest and premiums (including premiums) thereon plus other
reasonable and customary fees and expenses (including upfront fees and original issue discount)
incurred in connection with such refinancing or replacement, (y) any existing unutilized commitments
and letters of credit undrawn thereunder and (z) additional amounts permitted to be incurred under
the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and

178


-----

Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ and (i) for the avoidance of doubt, no Default or
Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in the Exchange Rate
occurring after the time of any specified transaction so long as such specified transaction was permitted
at the time incurred, made, acquired, committed, entered or declared as set forth in clause (i). For
purposes of the calculation of compliance with any financial ratio for purposes of taking any action
under the Indenture, on any relevant date of determination, amounts denominated in currencies other
than U.S. dollars shall be translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable Exchange Rate used in
preparing the financial statements delivered pursuant to the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Reports and Other Information’’ (or, prior to the first such delivery, the most recent
internally available financial statements), as applicable, for the relevant Test Period and will, with
respect to any Indebtedness, reflect the currency translation effects, determined in accordance with
GAAP, of any Hedge Agreement permitted under the Indenture in respect of currency exchange risks
with respect to the applicable currency in effect on the date of determination for the U.S. dollar
equivalent amount of such Indebtedness.

For purposes of the calculation of the Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured
Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, in connection with the
incurrence of any Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,’’
such Person may elect, pursuant to an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee, to treat all or any
portion of the commitment (such amount elected until revoked as described below, the ‘‘Elected
_Amount’’) under any Indebtedness which is to be incurred (or any commitment in respect thereof) or_
secured by such Lien (whether by the Issuer, its Restricted Subsidiaries or any third party), as the case
may be, as being incurred or secured, as the case may be, as of the date of determination and (i) any
subsequent incurrence of such Indebtedness under such commitment that was so treated (so long as the
total amount under such Indebtedness does not exceed the Elected Amount) shall not be deemed, for
purposes of this calculation, to be an incurrence of additional Indebtedness or an additional Lien at
such subsequent time, (ii) such Person may revoke an election of an Elected Amount pursuant to an
Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee and (iii) for subsequent calculations of the Consolidated
First Lien Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Elected Amount (if any) shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or
not such amount is actually outstanding.

For all purposes under the Indenture, in connection with any division or plan of division under
Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction’s laws): (a) if any asset, right,
obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person,
then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person,
and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been
organized on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Capital Stock at such time.

**DESCRIPTION OF UNSECURED NOTES**

**General**

Merger Sub will issue $2,080.0 million aggregate principal amount of % Senior Notes due
2028 (the ‘‘Notes’’) pursuant to an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the ‘‘Indenture’’),
between Merger Sub and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the ‘‘Trustee’’). Upon initial
issuance of the Notes, the Notes will be obligations solely of Merger Sub. Merger Sub is a newly
formed, wholly-owned direct Subsidiary of Holdings. Upon the consummation of the Transactions,
Merger Sub will merge with and into Zayo (the ‘‘Merger’’), with Zayo continuing as the surviving entity.
Upon the consummation of the Transactions, Zayo and the Guarantors will become parties to the
Indenture pursuant to a supplemental indenture to the Indenture, Merger Sub will cease to exist as a
result of the Merger and the obligations under the Indenture will become the obligations of Zayo and
the Guarantors. The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ The terms of the Notes will include the
terms stated in the Indenture and will not be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act.

The following description is only a summary of certain provisions of the Notes, the Note
Guarantees, the Indenture and the Escrow Agreement (as defined below), does not purport to be
complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the
Notes, the Indenture and the Escrow Agreement, including the definitions therein of certain terms used
below. We urge you to read each of these documents because they, not this description, define your
rights as Holders. You may request copies of the Notes, the Indenture and the Escrow Agreement at
our address set forth under the heading ‘‘Summary.’’

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the heading ‘‘Certain Definitions.’’ In this
description, (i) the terms ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘our’’ and ‘‘us’’ each refer to Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and its consolidated Subsidiaries, (ii) the term ‘‘Zayo’’ refers to Zayo Group Holdings, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation, and not any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) the term ‘‘Merger Sub’’ refers to Front
Range BidCo, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Holdings, and not any of
its Subsidiaries, (iv) the term ‘‘Issuer’’ refers (a) prior to the consummation of the Merger, to Merger
Sub, and not any of its Subsidiaries and (b) from and after the consummation of the Merger, to Zayo,
and not any of its Subsidiaries and (v) the term ‘‘Holdings’’ initially refers to Front Range TopCo, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation, and not any of its Subsidiaries.

Unless the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering, on
the Issue Date, the initial purchasers will deposit an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of this
offering of Notes into an escrow account (the ‘‘Escrow Account’’) pursuant to the terms of an escrow
agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the ‘‘Escrow Agreement’’) dated
as of the Issue Date among Merger Sub, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent (as defined below). In the
event the Effective Date has not occurred on or before the Outside Date (as defined below) or upon
the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below). The Escrow Agreement, including the conditions to
the release of the Escrowed Property (as defined below), is more fully described below under
‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

**Brief Description of the Notes**

Unless the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering,
prior to the Effective Date, the Notes will be the Issuer’s senior secured obligations, secured by a firstpriority lien on the Escrowed Property held in the Escrow Account. From and after satisfaction of the
Escrow Release Conditions or on the Issue Date if the Merger is consummated substantially
simultaneously with the closing of this offering, the Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the
Issuer.

238


-----

The Notes will be:

   - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

   - pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer,
including its obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities and its obligations under the Secured
Notes, the Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Notes and the Existing Notes Indentures;

   - effectively subordinated to all existing and future Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer, including
its obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Secured Notes and the Secured Notes
Indenture, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such Indebtedness; and

   - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities (including
trade payables) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors, other than Indebtedness
and liabilities owed to the Issuer or a Guarantor.

**Note Guarantees**

Prior to the Effective Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. On the Effective Date, upon the
consummation of the Merger and the execution by Zayo and each of the Guarantors of a supplemental
indenture to the Indenture, the Guarantors will jointly and severally fully and unconditionally
guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due,
whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and
the Indenture, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, expenses,
indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture.

Each Domestic Subsidiary that is a Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer (other than
any Receivables Subsidiary) that guarantees the payment of or borrows any Indebtedness under the
Senior Credit Facilities or guarantees certain other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary
Guarantor will, subject to certain exceptions and thresholds, guarantee the Notes. The Note
Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances as described under ‘‘—Release of Note
Guarantees.’’

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will be:

  - senior unsecured obligations of such Guarantor;

  - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor;

   - pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such
Guarantor, including its guarantee of the obligations under our Senior Credit Facilities and its
guarantee of the obligations under the Secured Notes, the Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing
Notes and the Existing Notes Indentures;

   - effectively subordinated to all existing and future Secured Indebtedness of such Guarantor,
including its guarantee of the obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Secured Notes
and the Secured Notes Indenture, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such
Indebtedness; and

   - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities (including
trade payables) of its Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, other than Indebtedness and
liabilities owed to the Issuer or a Guarantor.

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of the non-guarantor
Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and other liabilities,
including their trade creditors, before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or
a Guarantor. As adjusted for the Transactions, our non-guarantor Subsidiaries would have accounted

239


-----

for approximately $517.5 million, or 20.0%, of the Issuer’s consolidated total revenue, approximately
$82.5 million, or 25.8%, of the Issuer’s consolidated operating income, and approximately
$190.2 million, or 14.8%, of the Issuer’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, in each case, for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2019. The Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately
$1,487.7 million, or 14.9%, of the Issuer’s consolidated total assets, and approximately $836.8 million,
or 9.9%, of the Issuer’s consolidated total liabilities, in each case as of December 31, 2019.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such
Indebtedness could be substantial. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the
Notes—The notes and the note guarantees are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our
non-guarantor subsidiaries.’’

Each Guarantor that makes a payment under its Note Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in
full of all guaranteed Obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in
an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective
net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to
prevent such Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law and,
therefore, are limited to the amount that such Guarantor could guarantee without such Note
Guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance; this limitation, however, may not be effective to
prevent such Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance. If a Note Guarantee were
rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other Indebtedness (including guarantees
and other contingent liabilities) of the applicable Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such
Indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Note Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See ‘‘Risk
Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws
may permit a court to void the notes and/or the note guarantees and the liens securing the secured
notes and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the
liens securing the secured notes and the related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to
return payments received from us in respect of the notes and the guarantees and, if that occurs, you
may not receive any payments on the notes.’’

**_Release of Note Guarantees_**

Each Note Guarantee by a Guarantor shall provide by its terms that its obligations under the
Indenture and such Note Guarantee shall be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged:

(a) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon any sale, exchange, issuance, transfer or
other disposition (by merger, consolidation, amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of
(i) the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, after which such Subsidiary Guarantor is no
longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary
Guarantor, in each case, if such sale, exchange, issuance, transfer or other disposition is not
prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(b) (1) upon the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Guarantor of the obligations
under the Senior Credit Facilities, (2) upon the release or discharge of such other guarantee that
required such Guarantor to provide such Note Guarantee pursuant to the first paragraph under
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees’’ or (3) in the case of a Note Guarantee
required to be provided pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of the first paragraph under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees,’’ upon a reduction in aggregate principal amount of the
Indebtedness or capital markets debt securities, as the case may be, being guaranteed by such
Guarantor that resulted in such Guarantor providing such Note Guarantee to $350.0 million or

240


-----

less, except (A) in the case of clauses (1) and (2), a discharge or release by or as a result of
payment under such guarantee after the occurrence of a payment default or acceleration
thereunder (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still a
release) and (B) in all cases, if at the time of the release and discharge of such Note Guarantee,
such Guarantor would be required to guarantee the Notes pursuant to any of the provisions
described in ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees’’;

(c) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor
as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(d) upon the Issuer exercising the legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under ‘‘—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ or the Issuer’s obligations under
the Indenture being discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(e) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation or
winding up of such Subsidiary Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another Guarantor that is the
surviving Person in such merger, amalgamation, consolidation or winding up, or upon the
liquidation of such Subsidiary Guarantor;

(f) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension
Event; provided that, (i) such Note Guarantee shall not be released pursuant to this clause (f) for
so long as such Subsidiary Guarantor is an obligor with respect to any Indebtedness under the
Senior Credit Facilities and (ii) in the case of a Covenant Suspension Event, such Note Guarantee
shall be reinstated upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date;

(g) in the case of a Parent Guarantor, upon (i) such Parent Guarantor becoming ‘‘Previous
Holdings’’ in accordance with clause (ii) of the definition of ‘‘Holdings’’ and (ii) the assumption by
the applicable New Holdings of all obligations of such Previous Holdings under the Indenture
pursuant to a supplemental indenture or other applicable documents or instruments; or

(h) as described under ‘‘—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver’’.

**Ranking**

Unless the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering,
prior to the Effective Date, the Notes will be the Issuer’s senior secured obligations, secured by a firstpriority lien on the Escrowed Property held in the Escrow Account. From and after satisfaction of the
Escrow Release Conditions or on the Issue Date if the Merger is consummated substantially
simultaneously with the closing of this offering, the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and the Note
Guarantees will be Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be,
and will rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or
such Guarantor, as the case may be, including the obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities, the
Secured Notes Indenture, the Secured Notes, the guarantees thereof, the Existing Notes Indentures, the
Existing Notes and the guarantees thereof, as applicable. The Obligations under the Notes, the
Indenture and the Note Guarantees will be unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to all of the
Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ existing and future Secured Indebtedness, including the obligations under
our Senior Credit Facilities, the Secured Notes Indenture and the Secured Notes, to the extent of the
value of the collateral securing such Indebtedness. The phrase ‘‘in right of payment’’ refers to the
contractual ranking of a particular Obligation, regardless of whether an Obligation is secured.

Merger Sub is a limited purpose entity and does not hold or otherwise have any interest in any
material assets other than the Escrow Account. Substantially all of the operations of the Issuer are
conducted through the Issuer’s Subsidiaries. Not all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the
Notes, and as described under ‘‘Note Guarantees,’’ Note Guarantees may be released under certain
circumstances. In addition, the Issuer’s future Subsidiaries may not be required to guarantee the Notes.

241


-----

Unless the Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries, including trade creditors,
and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally will have priority with
respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the
Guarantors, including the holders of the Notes, even if the claims of the creditors of such Subsidiaries
do not constitute Senior Indebtedness. The Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to
holders of Indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if
any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors, other than Indebtedness and liabilities owed
to the Issuer or a Guarantor.

As of December 31, 2019, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and the Guarantors
would have had:

  - $6,247.5 million of secured Senior Indebtedness, consisting of borrowings under the new term
loan facilities under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Secured Notes and the related guarantees
and finance lease obligations, with $750.0 million available for drawdowns under the revolving
credit facility (without giving effect to $8.8 million of outstanding letters of credit); and

  - $2,302.3 million of unsecured Senior Indebtedness (including the Existing Notes and the Notes).

As of December 31, 2019, after giving effect to the Transactions, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries
would have had $836.8 million, or 9.9%, of the Issuer’s consolidated total liabilities, all of which would
have been structurally senior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness and
Disqualified Stock that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur or issue, and on the amount
of Preferred Stock that its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors may issue, such limitations
are subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications. The amount of such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock that may be incurred or issued in compliance with the
covenants could be substantial and in certain circumstances, may be Secured Indebtedness. See
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock.’’ See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Despite
our substantial level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries will be permitted to incur substantial
additional indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial
indebtedness.’’ Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the incurrence or issuance of
liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the
Indenture.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial paying agent for the
Notes will be the Trustee.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar. The initial registrar will be the Trustee. The registrar will
maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time and will make
payments on and facilitate transfer of Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Issuer or any Guarantor in respect
of the Notes shall be made without any deduction or withholding for any taxes, unless the obligation to
deduct or withhold is required by Requirements of Law. If any such deduction or withholding is
required by Requirements of Law, payments by or on account of any obligation of the Issuer or any
Guarantor in respect of the Notes shall be made net of such deduction or withholding.

The Issuer may change the paying agents or the registrars without prior notice to the Holders. The
Issuer or any of its Affiliates may act as a paying agent or registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture and the restrictions set
forth in the section of this offering memorandum entitled ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ The registrar and the
Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in
connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes and fees required by law
and due on transfer. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for
redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer, an Alternate Offer, an Asset Sale Offer, an Advance Offer or other tender offer. Also, the
Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of
Notes to be redeemed.

The registered Holder will be treated as the owner of the Note for all purposes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue the Notes initially with an aggregate principal amount of $2,080.0 million. The
Notes will mature on, 2028.

Subject to compliance with the covenant described below under the caption ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock,’’ the Issuer may issue additional Notes from time to time after the Issue Date under the
Indenture (‘‘Additional Notes’’). The Notes offered hereby and any Additional Notes issued under the
Indenture after the Issue Date will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture,
including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase; provided that if any Additional
Notes are not fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Additional Notes will
have a separate CUSIP number and ISIN from the Notes. Unless the context requires otherwise,
references to ‘‘Notes’’ for all purposes of the Indenture, the Note Guarantees and this ‘‘Description of
Unsecured Notes’’ include any Additional Notes that are actually issued.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable in cash
semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on, 2020, to the
Holders of record as of the close of business (if applicable) on the immediately preceding and
(whether or not a Business Day). Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to
which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for,
from and including the Issue Date. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day
year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of
the paying agent maintained for such purpose as described under ‘‘—Paying Agent and Registrar for
the Notes’’ or, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the
Holders at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders or by wire transfer; provided
that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by
one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be made in
accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures. Until otherwise designated by the Issuer, the Issuer’s
office or agency will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose. If any interest payment
date, the maturity date or any earlier required repurchase or Redemption Date falls on a day that is a
Legal Holiday, the required payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no interest
on such payment will accrue in respect of the delay.

The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000
in excess thereof.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Escrow Conditions**

Unless the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering,
concurrently with the closing of this offering, Merger Sub will enter into the Escrow Agreement with
the Trustee and U.S. Bank National Association, as escrow agent (in such capacity, together with its
successors, the ‘‘Escrow Agent’’). Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, Merger Sub will deposit (or cause
to be deposited) into the Escrow Account an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the offering of the
Notes sold on the Issue Date (collectively and, together with any other property from time to time held
by the Escrow Agent in the Escrow Account, the ‘‘Escrowed Property’’). The Escrow Account will not
include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the Notes which is required
to be paid upon a Special Mandatory Redemption. On the Issue Date, one or more of the Investors
will execute a commitment letter pursuant to which such Investor(s) will commit to fund, upon the
occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption, the amount by which the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds the amount of the
Escrowed Property in the Escrow Account on such date.

The Escrowed Property will be held in the Escrow Account until the earlier of (i) an Escrow
Release (as defined below) following the delivery by Merger Sub to the Escrow Agent of the Officer’s
Certificate referred to in the next succeeding paragraph and (ii) a Special Mandatory Redemption
Date. Merger Sub will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the Holders, subject to
certain liens of the Escrow Agent, a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account and all
Eligible Escrow Investments therein to secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price
(as defined below); provided, however, that such lien and security interest shall automatically be released
and terminated at such time as the Escrowed Property is released from the Escrow Account on the
Escrow Release Date (as defined below). The Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property in such
Eligible Escrow Investments, and liquidate such Eligible Escrow Investments, as Merger Sub will from
time to time direct in writing.

Subject to the provisions described below in ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ Merger Sub will
only be entitled to direct the Escrow Agent to release Escrowed Property (in which case the Escrowed
Property will be paid to or as directed by Merger Sub) (the ‘‘Escrow Release’’) upon delivery to the
Escrow Agent, on or prior to August 14, 2020 (the ‘‘Outside Date’’), of an Officer’s Certificate,
certifying that the following conditions (the ‘‘Escrow Release Conditions’’) have been or, substantially
concurrently with the release of the Escrowed Property, will be satisfied (the date of the Escrow
Release is hereinafter referred to as the ‘‘Escrow Release Date’’):

(1) the Merger will occur substantially concurrently with such release;

(2) all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of, and borrowings under, the Senior Credit
Facilities (other than the release of the Escrowed Property) have been satisfied or waived in all
material respects; and

(3) Zayo will substantially concurrently with such release, assume all of the obligations of
Merger Sub under the Notes and the Indenture, and the Guarantors will substantially concurrently
with such release, become, by supplemental indenture, party to the Indenture in the capacities
described herein.

The Escrow Release shall occur promptly upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of an Officer’s
Certificate certifying to the foregoing. Upon the occurrence of the Escrow Release, the Escrow
Account shall be reduced to zero and the Escrowed Property and interest thereon shall be paid out in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

If at any time the Escrow Account contains funds having an aggregate value in excess of the
Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below) in respect of the Notes as determined by the
Issuer, such excess cash shall be released to or at the direction of the Issuer.

244


-----

By its acceptance of a Note, each Holder shall be deemed to have authorized and directed the
Trustee and the Escrow Agent to enter into and perform its obligations, if any, under the Escrow
Agreement.

If the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering, the
foregoing provisions relating to the escrow of proceeds of the Notes shall not apply and shall have no
force or effect.

**Special Mandatory Redemption**

If (i) the Escrow Agent has not received the Officer’s Certificate described above under ‘‘Escrow
of Proceeds; Escrow Conditions’’ on or prior to the Outside Date, (ii) Merger Sub notifies the Escrow
Agent in writing that in its reasonable judgment the Merger will not be consummated on or prior to
the Outside Date or (iii) Merger Sub notifies the Escrow Agent in writing that the Transaction
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, then the Escrow Agent shall release the
Escrowed Property (including investment earnings thereon and proceeds thereof) to the Trustee, on the
third Business Day succeeding (a) the Outside Date (in the case of clause (i)) or (b) the date of such
notice (in the case of clause (ii) or (iii)), as the case may be (such third Business Day, the ‘‘Special
_Mandatory Redemption Date’’), and the Trustee shall pay the amounts to the paying agent for payment_
to the Holders of the Notes (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption’’) at a redemption price calculated by
Merger Sub (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption Price’’) equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the
Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date. On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Trustee will pay to Merger Sub
any Escrowed Property (including investment earnings thereon and proceeds thereof) in excess of the
amount necessary to effect the Special Mandatory Redemption on such Notes on the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date.

If the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of this offering, the
foregoing provisions relating to Special Mandatory Redemption of the Notes shall not apply and shall
have no force or effect.

**Activities Prior to Release**

Prior to the Escrow Release Date, the activities of Merger Sub will be restricted to issuing the
Notes, engaging in other financing activities related to the Transactions and performing its obligations
in connection with any documents relating thereto, issuing capital stock to, and receiving capital
contributions from, Holdings or any other Parent Company, performing its obligations in respect of the
Notes under the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement and the purchase agreement with the initial
purchasers, performing its obligations under the Transaction Agreement and consummating the
Transactions, redeeming the Notes and any other indebtedness issued by it in connection with the
Transactions, if applicable, and conducting such other activities as are necessary or appropriate in
connection with the Transactions or to carry out the activities described above.

Prior to the Escrow Release Date, none of Zayo or its Subsidiaries will be party to the Indenture
and will not be controlled by Merger Sub; accordingly, prior to the Escrow Release Date, none of Zayo
or its Subsidiaries will be subject to the restrictions, agreements or covenants set forth in the Indenture
and described herein.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes, other than as described above under ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ In
addition, other than as required under ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control’’
and ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,’’ the Issuer will not be required to offer to

245


-----

repurchase or redeem or otherwise modify the terms of any of the Notes upon a change in control of,
or other events involving, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries that may adversely affect the
creditworthiness of the Notes. We and our equity holders, including the Investors, their respective
Affiliates and members of our management, may, at their discretion, at any time and from time to time
purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Notes, in the open market, in privately
negotiated transactions, through tender offers or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations
contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, any purchases made
by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or
unsecured debt, including borrowing under the Senior Credit Facilities. The amounts involved in any
such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with
respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in
the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such purchases made at prices below the
‘‘adjusted issue price’’ (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable
cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which could be material, and in related adverse tax
consequences to us.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below or in the circumstances set forth in the tenth paragraph under
‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,’’ the Issuer will not be entitled to
redeem the Notes at its option prior to, 2023.

At any time prior to, 2023, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions,
redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon notice as described under the heading ‘‘—Repurchase at the
Option of Holders—Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but excluding the date of redemption (any applicable date of redemption, the ‘‘Redemption
_Date’’), subject to the right of Holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive_
interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date.

On and after, 2023, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem
the Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under the heading ‘‘—Repurchase at the
Option of Holders—Selection and Notice,’’ at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of
principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of
record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period
beginning on of each of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2023 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %
2024 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %
2025 and thereafter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100.000%

In addition, prior to, 2023, the Issuer may, at its option, upon notice as described under
the heading ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and Notice,’’ on one or more
occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional
Notes) issued and outstanding under the Indenture at a redemption price (as calculated by the Issuer)
equal to (i) % of the aggregate principal amount thereof, in an amount equal to or less than the
amount of net cash proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings to the extent such net cash proceeds
are received by or contributed to the Issuer, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to,
but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record of the Notes
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or

246


-----

prior to the Redemption Date; provided that (a) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes originally issued under the Indenture on the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately after
the occurrence of each such redemption (except to the extent otherwise repurchased or redeemed or to
be repurchased or redeemed and for which a notice of repurchase or redemption has been issued at or
about such time in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) and (b) each such redemption occurs
within 180 days of the date of closing of such Equity Offering.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, if Holders of not
less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party approved in writing by the
Issuer making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (except that such notice may be delivered or mailed more than
60 days prior to the Redemption Date or purchase date if the notice is subject to one or more
conditions precedent as described under ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and
Notice’’), given not more than 60 days following such purchase date, to redeem (with respect to the
Issuer) or purchase (with respect to a third party) all of the Notes that remain outstanding following
such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other Holder in such tender offer (which may
be less than par and shall exclude any early tender premium or similar premium and any accrued and
unpaid interest paid to any Holder in such tender offer) plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
thereon, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date or purchase date, subject to the right of Holders of
record of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date or purchase date. For the avoidance of doubt, in
determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer, Notes
owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer, by portfolio companies or funds controlled or managed by an
Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, or by Debt Fund Affiliates shall be deemed to be
outstanding.

The Notes to be redeemed shall be selected in the manner described under ‘‘—Repurchase at the
Option of Holders—Selection and Notice.’’

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Effective Date, unless,
prior to or concurrently with the time the Issuer is required to make a Change of Control Offer, the
Issuer or a third-party has mailed or delivered, or otherwise sent through electronic transmission, a
redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under ‘‘—Optional
Redemption’’ or ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge,’’ the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the
Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) at a price in cash equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof (or such higher amount as the Issuer may determine
(any Change of Control Offer at a higher amount, an ‘‘Alternate Offer’’)) (such price, the ‘‘Change of
_Control Payment’’) plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding the date of purchase,_
subject to the right of Holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date
(as defined below). Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such
Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the

247


-----

address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise deliver in accordance with the
procedures of DTC, with the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled
‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,’’ and that all Notes properly
tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 20 Business Days
nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment Date’’);
_provided, that the Change of Control Payment Date shall be delayed until such time (including_
more than 60 days after the date such notice is sent) as any or all such conditions referred to in
clause (8) below shall be satisfied or waived;

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue
interest;

(4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment plus
accrued and unpaid interest on all properly tendered Notes, all Notes accepted for payment
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control
Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer
will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled ‘‘Option of Holder to Elect
Purchase’’ on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures
of DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to
the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) until the close of business on the tenth Business Day after the date such notice is sent (or
such later time and date as the Issuer may decide in its sole discretion) (such time and date, the
‘‘withdrawal deadline’’), that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their
election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not
later than the withdrawal deadline, as electronic transmission (in PDF), a facsimile transmission or
letter or other communication in accordance with the procedures of DTC settling forth the name
of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement
that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased;

(7) that if less than all of such Holder’s Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be
issued new Notes (or, in the case of global notes, such Notes shall be reduced by such amount of
Notes that the Holder has tendered) and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the
unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered (the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be
equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof);

(8) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the
Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control or such other
conditions specified therein and shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state
that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such
time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered) as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may
be rescinded in the event that the Issuer reasonably believes that any or all such conditions
(including the occurrence of such Change of Control) will not be satisfied or waived by the Change
of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and

(9) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a
Holder must follow.

248


-----

If a notice relating to a Change of Control Offer that is subject to one or more conditions
precedent (other than the occurrence of a Change of Control) is later rescinded as described in
clause (8) above as a result of the failure of such condition(s) to be satisfied or waived (or as a result
of the Issuer reasonably believing that such will be the case), the offer described in such notice will not
be deemed a valid ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’ for purposes of this covenant.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of
the Notes through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer
will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have
breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer,

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control
Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted
together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof
have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer.

The Senior Credit Facilities will, and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to
Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or any of its Affiliates) becomes a party may, provide that certain
change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a
Change of Control under the Secured Notes Indenture or the Indenture). If the Issuer experiences a
change of control that triggers a default under the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other
agreements or results in a requirement to offer to repurchase the Indebtedness governed by such
agreement, including the Secured Notes Indenture, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to
refinance the Senior Credit Facilities and/or the Indebtedness governed by such other agreements. In
the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other
agreements or repurchase such Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under
the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements being declared due and payable.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control
may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
this Offering—We may not be able to finance an offer to purchase the Notes following a Change of
Control as required by the indenture because we may not have sufficient funds at the time of the
Change of Control or our Senior Credit Facilities may not allow the repurchases.’’

249


-----

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more
difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer, and, thus, the removal of incumbent
management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial
purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of
Control after the Merger is consummated, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the
future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the
ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in
the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.’’ Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived
with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not
contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a
highly leveraged transaction that does not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party approved in
writing by the Issuer makes the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an
Alternate Offer) in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an
Alternate Offer) may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of
Control and such other conditions specified therein, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change
of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party
approved in writing by the Issuer making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described
above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or
such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (except
that such notice may be delivered or mailed more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date or
purchase date if the notice is subject to one or more conditions precedent as described under
‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and Notice’’), given not more than 60 days
following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem (with
respect to the Issuer) or purchase (with respect to a third party) all of the Notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase on a date (the ‘‘Second Change of Control Payment Date’’) at a
price in cash equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of the Second Change of Control
Payment Date, including, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Second Change of Control Payment Date, subject
to the right of Holders of record of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Second Change of Control Payment Date. In
determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a Change of Control Offer,
Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer, by portfolio companies or funds controlled or managed by
any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, or by Debt Fund Affiliates shall be deemed to be
outstanding.

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than any Permitted Holder.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no

250


-----

precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances
there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition
of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it may
be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may
require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control
Offer upon a Change of Control may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. A Change of
Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made at the same
time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture,
the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees so long as the tender of Notes by a Holder is not conditioned
upon the delivery of consents by such Holder. In addition, the Issuer or any third party approved in
writing by the Issuer that is making the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, an Alternate Offer) may, subject to applicable law, increase or decrease the Change of Control
Payment (or decline to pay any early tender or similar premium) being offered to Holders at any time
in its sole discretion, so long as the Change of Control Payment is at least equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

**_Selection and Notice_**

With respect to any partial redemption or purchase of Notes made pursuant to the Indenture,
selection of the Notes for redemption or purchase will be made on a pro rata basis to the extent
applicable or by lot or by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate; provided that if
the Notes are represented by global notes, interests in the Notes shall be selected for redemption or
purchase by DTC in accordance with its standard procedures therefor; provided, further, that no Notes
of less than $2,000 can be redeemed or repurchased in part.

Notices of redemption or offers to purchase shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class
mail, postage prepaid, at least 10 days (or such shorter period as is specified solely in respect of a
Special Mandatory Redemption) and not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date or purchase
date to each Holder at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures
of DTC, except that notices of redemption may be delivered or mailed more than 60 days prior to a
Redemption Date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes, a satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture or as specified in the immediately succeeding paragraph. If any Note is
to be redeemed or purchased in part only, any notice of redemption or offer to purchase that relates to
such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be redeemed or
purchased.

Any redemption of, or offer to purchase, the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to
the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including the completion or occurrence of an
Equity Offering, other transaction (or series of related transactions) or an event that constitutes a
Change of Control. If a redemption or purchase is subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, notice of such redemption or purchase may be given in connection with the related Equity
Offering, transaction or event, as the case may be, and prior to the completion or the occurrence
thereof. Such notice shall describe each such condition and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s
discretion, the redemption or purchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than
60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was mailed or delivered, including
by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or such
redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all
such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived, or at any time in the Issuer’s discretion if the
Issuer reasonably believes that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived, in each case
by the redemption or purchase date or by the redemption or purchase date as so delayed. In addition,

251


-----

the Issuer may provide in any notice of redemption or offer to purchase the Notes that payment of the
redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such
redemption or offer to purchase may be performed by another Person.

The Issuer may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture,
and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to
different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different
provisions will have different redemption dates and, with respect to redemptions that occur on the
same date, may specify the order in which such redemptions are deemed to occur.

With respect to Notes represented by certificated notes, if any Notes are to be redeemed or
purchased in part only, the Issuer will issue a new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed
or unpurchased portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of
the original Note; _provided that the new Notes will be only issued in denominations of $2,000 and any_
integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Notes called for redemption or purchase become due on the date fixed for redemption or
purchase, unless such redemption or purchase is conditioned on the happening of a future event. On
and after the redemption or purchase date, unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption or
purchase price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption or
purchase, unless such redemption or purchase remains conditioned on the occurrence of a future event
that has not occurred.

**_Asset Sales_**

From and after the Effective Date, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale unless:

(1) other than in the case of the Specified Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any
other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in connection with
such Asset Sale) at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (measured
at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed
of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap or the Specified Asset Sale, in any such
Asset Sale with a purchase price in excess of the greater of (x) $200.0 million and (y) 15.0% of
Annualized EBITDA (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), at least
75% of the consideration (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) for
such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales completed or contractually agreed upon since
the Effective Date (on a cumulative basis), received (or to be received) by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents.

Within 18 months after the later of (A) the date of any Asset Sale and (B) receipt of any Net
Proceeds from any Asset Sale (the ‘‘Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period’’), the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount equal to the Applicable Percentage of the
Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale (excluding any Net Proceeds from the Specified Asset Sale that are
in excess of $715.0 million) (the ‘‘Applicable Proceeds’’),

(a) to repay (i) Obligations under the Notes, the Secured Notes or the Senior Credit
Facilities, (ii) Obligations under Secured Indebtedness incurred pursuant to a Credit Facility to the
extent such Obligations were incurred under clause (a) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock’’ and/or (iii) Obligations under any other Secured Indebtedness, and in each case,
in the case of revolving obligations (other than obligations in respect of any asset-based credit

252


-----

facility to the extent the assets sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant to such Asset Sale constitute
‘‘borrowing base assets’’ thereunder), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

(b) to repay Obligations under any Senior Indebtedness (other than any Senior Indebtedness
referred to in clause (a) above), and in the case of revolving obligations (other than obligations in
respect of any asset-based credit facility to the extent the assets sold or otherwise disposed of
pursuant to such Asset Sale constitute ‘‘borrowing base assets’’ thereunder), to correspondingly
reduce commitments with respect thereto; provided that the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
will either (A) reduce the aggregate principal amount of Obligations under the Notes on a ratable
basis with any Senior Indebtedness repaid pursuant to this clause (b) by, at its option,
(x) redeeming Notes as provided under ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’ and/or (y) purchasing Notes
through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions (which may be below par)
and/or (B) make an offer (in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Sale
Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes on a ratable basis with any Senior Indebtedness
repaid pursuant to this clause (b) for no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the
amount of accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon (which offer shall be deemed to be an
Asset Sale Offer for purposes hereof);

(c) to invest in the business of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, including (i) any investment in
Additional Assets, (ii) making capital expenditures in respect of assets used or useful in a Similar
Business and (iii) any investment in any property or other assets that replace the businesses,
properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; provided, that the Issuer may elect
to deem expenditures that otherwise would be permissible investments in Additional Assets, capital
expenditures or investments in property or other assets within the scope of the foregoing
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), as applicable, that occur prior to the receipt of the Net Proceeds from
such Asset Sale to have been invested in accordance with this clause (c) (it being agreed that such
deemed expenditure shall have been made no earlier than the earliest of (x) notice of such Asset
Sale, (y) execution of a definitive agreement for such Asset Sale, if applicable, and
(z) consummation of such Asset Sale);

(d) to repay Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Guarantor, and, in the case of revolving obligations (other
than obligations in respect of any asset-based credit facility to the extent the assets sold or
otherwise disposed of pursuant to such Asset Sale constitute ‘‘borrowing base assets’’ thereunder),
to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; or

(e) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, in the case of clause (c) above, a binding commitment or letter of intent shall be treated_
as a permitted application of the Applicable Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of
intent so long as the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of
intent with the good faith expectation that such Applicable Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such
commitment or letter of intent within 180 days of the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application
Period (an ‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’) and such Applicable Proceeds are actually applied in such
manner within 180 days of the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (the period
from the consummation of the Asset Sale to such date, the ‘‘Commitment Application Period’’), and, in
the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason after the
expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period and before the Applicable Proceeds are
applied in connection therewith, then such Applicable Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary reasonably expects to enter into another Acceptable
Commitment prior to the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period and such Applicable
Proceeds are actually applied in such manner prior to the expiration of the Commitment Application
Period. To the extent Applicable Proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed amounts that are invested or

253


-----

applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph, such excess
amount will be deemed to constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’; provided that any amount of Applicable
Proceeds offered to Holders of any Notes pursuant to clause (b) of the preceding paragraph shall not
be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to whether such offer is accepted by any Holders. If
at any time the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $150.0 million, then the Issuer shall
within 20 Business Days make an offer to all Holders and, if required or permitted by the terms of
other Indebtedness that is pari passu in right of payment with the Notes (‘‘Pari Passu Indebtedness’’), to
the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (an ‘‘Asset Sale Offer’’), to purchase the maximum
aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness out of the amount of the Excess Proceeds (which, (x) in the case of the Notes only, is
equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof and at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
date fixed for the repurchase of such Notes pursuant to such offer, in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the Indenture and (y) in the case of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, if applicable, is in
accordance with the documents governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness). The Issuer will commence an
Asset Sale Offer by sending the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to
the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to such Applicable Proceeds
from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer in advance of being required to do so by the
Indenture (an ‘‘Advance Offer’’) with respect to all or part of the available Applicable Proceeds (the
‘‘Advance Portion’’).

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable,
Pari Passu Indebtedness, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or,
in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess
Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in any manner not prohibited by
the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and Pari
Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds
(or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Notes shall be selected pro rata
(subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and the Issuer or the representative of such
Pari Passu Indebtedness shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased or repaid on a pro
rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness tendered, with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as
the case may be, will be repurchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such
Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are
any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion), and in the case of an Advance Offer, the
Advance Portion shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds.

Pending the final application of an amount equal to the Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this
covenant, the holder of such Applicable Proceeds may apply any Applicable Proceeds temporarily to
reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility (including under the Senior Credit
Facilities) or otherwise invest such Applicable Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.
The Issuer (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to invest in Additional Assets
prior to receiving the Applicable Proceeds attributable to any given Asset Sale (provided that such
investment shall be made no earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the relevant Asset
Sale, execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Sale and consummation of the relevant
Asset Sale) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with the
second paragraph of this covenant with respect to such Asset Sale. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Holder of any Retained Asset Sale Proceeds may apply any Retained Asset Sale Proceeds in any
manner not prohibited by the Indenture and such Retained Asset Sale Proceeds shall in no event and
under no circumstances constitute Excess Proceeds.

254


-----

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, for so long as the repatriation,
distribution or dividend to the Issuer of any Net Proceeds of an Asset Sale by a Restricted Subsidiary
that is not a Guarantor would (i) be prohibited, delayed or restricted under any Requirements of Law
or conflict with the fiduciary duties of the directors of the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor, or result in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a material risk of personal or
criminal liability for any officer, director, employee, manager, member of management, member,
partner, independent contractor or consultant of such Restricted Subsidiary (the Issuer hereby agreeing
to cause the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to promptly take all commercially
reasonable actions available under applicable Requirements of Law to permit such repatriation or to
remove such prohibition); (ii) be prohibited, delayed or restricted under the organizational documents
governing the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; or (iii) as determined in good
faith by the Issuer, result in a material adverse tax liability (including any tax dividend, deemed
dividend pursuant to Section 956 of the Code and withholding tax obligation) to the Issuer or its
Subsidiaries or any Parent Companies, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so
affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant and shall not constitute
Excess Proceeds and may be retained by the Issuer or the applicable Subsidiary; provided, that, if within
18 months following the date on which application of the portion of such Net Proceeds would
otherwise have been required pursuant to this covenant, such repatriation, distribution or dividend of
such Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable Requirements of Law, would no longer conflict
with the fiduciary duties of such director, or result in, or be reasonably expected to result in, a material
risk of personal or criminal liability for the Persons described above, would no longer be prohibited,
delayed or restricted under the applicable organizational documents and/or in the good faith
determination of the Issuer would no longer have a material adverse tax liability, then such portion of
the Net Proceeds shall be promptly applied (net of additional taxes that would be payable or reserved
against as a result of repatriating such amounts) in compliance with this covenant.

For purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant (and no other provision), the
following shall be deemed to be cash or Cash Equivalents:

(1) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected
on the most recent balance sheet of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or in the footnotes
thereto, or if incurred, accrued or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such
liabilities that would have been reflected on the balance sheet of the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence, accrual or increase had taken place on or
prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, that are assumed by the transferee of any such
assets (or are otherwise extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset
Sale) pursuant to a written agreement which releases or indemnifies the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such liabilities;

(2) the amount of any trade-in value applied to the purchase price of any replacement assets
acquired in connection with such Asset Sale;

(3) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by the Issuer
acting in good faith to be converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash or Cash Equivalents (to the
extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the
closing of such Asset Sale; and

(4) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received in respect of such Asset Sale having an
aggregate fair market value (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale and

255


-----

without giving effect to subsequent changes in value), taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (4) that is outstanding at such time, not
in excess of the greater of $300.0 million and 20.0% of Annualized EBITDA of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, shall be deemed to be cash.

To the extent that any portion of Applicable Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is
denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes
shall not exceed the net amount of funds in dollars that is actually received by the Issuer upon
converting such portion into U.S. dollars.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the asset sale provisions
of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not
be deemed to have breached its obligations under the asset sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of
such compliance.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent
of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. An Asset
Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an
amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees so long as
the tender of the Notes by a Holder is not conditioned upon the delivery of consents by such Holder.

The Senior Credit Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to
Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or any of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain
change of control events (including events constituting a Change of Control under the Indenture) with
respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder or result in a requirement to offer to
repurchase the Indebtedness governed by such agreement, including the Secured Notes Indenture. If
the Issuer experiences a change of control that triggers such a default or results in a requirement to
offer to repurchase the Indebtedness governed by such agreement, we may seek a waiver of such
default or seek to refinance the Indebtedness governed by such agreement. In the event we do not
obtain such a waiver or are unable to refinance or otherwise repurchase such indebtedness as required
by the applicable agreement, such default would result in all amounts outstanding under such
agreement being declared due and payable, which could in turn result in an Event of Default under the
Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Effectiveness of Covenants_**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants to be contained in the Indenture. If on any
date following the Effective Date, (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from two of three
Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the
occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as
a ‘‘Covenant Suspension Event’’), then beginning on such date and continuing until the Reversion Date
(as defined below), the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following
covenants (collectively, the ‘‘Suspended Covenants’’):

(1) ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales;’’

(2) ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments;’’

256


-----

(3) ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock;’’

(4) clause (d) of the first paragraph and the entire third paragraph of ‘‘—Merger,
Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets;’’

(5) ‘‘—Transactions with Affiliates;’’

(6) ‘‘—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries;’’ and

(7) ‘‘—Additional Note Guarantees.’’

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended
Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any
subsequent date (the ‘‘Reversion Date’’) the rating assigned to the Notes by two of three of the Rating
Agencies is below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will
thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future
events.

The period of time between (and including) the date of the Covenant Suspension Event and the
Reversion Date (but excluding the Reversion Date) is referred to in this description as the ‘‘Suspension
_Period.’’ The Note Guarantees of the Guarantors will be suspended and/or released during the_
Suspension Period. In the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by
the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or
Event of Default with respect to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture; provided that, (1) with
respect to Restricted Payments made on or after the Reversion Date and the capacity to make
Restricted Payments, the amount of Restricted Payments made and the capacity to make Restricted
Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Limitation on
Restricted Payments’’ had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with
respect to a Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) and accordingly,
Restricted Payments made or deemed to be made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the
amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation
on Restricted Payments’’, including clause (2) of the first paragraph thereof, (2) all Indebtedness
incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period (or deemed
incurred or issued in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the
Suspension Period) will be deemed to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (j) of the second
paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock,’’ (3) no Subsidiaries shall be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during any
Suspension Period, unless such designation would have complied with the covenant described under the
caption ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ as if such covenant was in effect for the purposes of
designating Unrestricted Subsidiaries from the Effective Date to the date of such designation, (4) any
Affiliate Transaction entered into on or after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered
into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (e) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Transactions with Affiliates,’’ (5) any
encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take
any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under
‘‘—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries’’ that becomes effective
during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (i) of the covenant
described under ‘‘—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ and
(6) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with a Limited
Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made
pursuant to clause (f) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investments.’’ On the Reversion Date, the amount
of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Upon any Reversion Date, the obligation to grant Note
Guarantees pursuant to the covenant described below under ‘‘—Additional Note Guarantees’’ will be

257


-----

reinstated and such Reversion Date will be deemed to be the date on which any guaranteed
Indebtedness was incurred for purposes of such covenant, such that a Restricted Subsidiary shall have
60 days from such Reversion Date to provide a Note Guarantee that would have been required to have
been provided during the Suspension Period had such covenant not been suspended.

During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur
Liens permitted under ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’ (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens). To the
extent such covenant and any Permitted Liens refer to one or more Suspended Covenants, such
covenant or definition shall be interpreted as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued
to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for purposes of the ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’
covenant and the ‘‘Permitted Liens’’ definition and for no other covenant).

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no
Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist or have occurred under the
Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Indenture with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of
the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring
during the Suspension Period (including any Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the
Suspension Period), or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation entered
into or arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the
Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or
after that time, as a result of any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period),
and (2) following a Reversion Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted,
without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any
contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby (including any Limited Condition Transaction entered into during
the Suspension Period).

We cannot assure you that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

If the Suspended Covenants are suspended for any period as described above, the Holders will be
entitled to substantially less covenant protection. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness
and the Notes—Many of the covenants in the indentures that will govern the notes will be suspended if
the notes have investment grade ratings from any two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch.’’

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor, inquire as to or ascertain compliance with the
covenants described below.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

From and after the Effective Date, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to:

(I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the Issuer’s or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (in each case, solely to a holder of Equity Interests
in such Person’s capacity as a holder of such Equity Interests), including any dividend or distribution
payable in connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation other than:

(a) dividends, payments or distributions by the Issuer payable solely in Qualified Capital
Stock of the Issuer or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase Qualified Capital Stock; or

(b) dividends, payments or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of
any dividend, payment or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities
issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend, payment or distribution in
accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities;

258


-----

(II) redeem, purchase, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity
Interests of the Issuer or any Parent Company, including in connection with any merger, amalgamation
or consolidation, in each case, held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

(III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, purchase, repurchase, defease, discharge or
otherwise acquire or retire for value, in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund
payment or maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness (such payment and other actions described in the
foregoing (subject to the exceptions in clauses (a) and (b) below), ‘‘Restricted Debt Payments’’), other
than:

(a) Indebtedness permitted to be incurred or issued under clause (c) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock;’’ or

(b) the prepayment, redemption, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, discharge or other
acquisition or retirement of Subordinated Indebtedness in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund
obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of
prepayment, redemption, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, discharge or acquisition or retirement;
or

(IV) make any Restricted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I)
through (IV) above (other than any exceptions thereto) being collectively referred to as ‘‘Restricted
_Payments’’), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment:_

(1) in the case of a Restricted Payment under any of clauses (I), (II) and (III) above (other
than with respect to amounts attributable to subclauses (a)(i) and (a)(iii) through (a)(x) of
clause (2) below), no Event of Default described under clause (1), (2) or (6) of the first paragraph
of ‘‘—Events of Default and Remedies’’ shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a
consequence thereof; and

(2) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted
Payments made by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Effective Date pursuant to
this clause (2), is less than the sum of (without duplication):

Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ (other than any such Subordinated Indebtedness incurred
(x) to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise
acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or (y) otherwise in connection with or in

contemporaneously with, or substantially simultaneously with, the closing of the transaction under
which such Subordinated Indebtedness is assumed; and

(xxxii) any mandatory redemption, repurchase, retirement, termination or cancellation of Disqualified

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the fair market value on the
relevant date of determination, in the case of a Subject Transaction, or the date of the Restricted
Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Issuer or any Restricted

As of the Effective Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The Issuer
will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the
second and third paragraphs of the definition of ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary.’’ Unrestricted Subsidiaries
will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture and will not guarantee

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
in a Permitted Investment to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Equity Interests of the
Issuer, any Parent Company or any of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the
holders of the Equity Interests of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Company or to
Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a ‘‘direct or
indirect’’ action by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

From and after the Effective Date, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become
directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise (collectively, ‘‘incur’’ and collectively, an
‘‘incurrence’’) with respect to any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer will
not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue any
shares of Disqualified Stock or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to issue Preferred
Stock; provided, however, that the Issuer may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and
issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness), and issue shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if either
(x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00 or (y) the
Consolidated Total Debt Ratio of the Issuer would have been equal to or less than 6.50 to 1.00, in each
case, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds
therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at
the beginning of the Test Period.

Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur or assume any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, a
‘‘Subject Lien’’) that secures Obligations under any Indebtedness on any asset or property of the Issuer

assets or property of a Subsidiary Guarantor) are equally and ratably secured with (or, at the Issuer’s
option or if such Subject Lien secures Subordinated Indebtedness, on a senior basis to) the Obligations
secured by such Subject Lien.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall provide
by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the
release and discharge of the Subject Lien that gave rise to the obligation to secure the Notes. In
addition, in the event that a Subject Lien is or becomes a Permitted Lien, the Issuer may, at its option
and without consent from any Holder, elect to release and discharge any Lien created for the benefit of
the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph in respect of such Subject Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at
the time of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any
Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The ‘‘Increased Amount’’ of any Indebtedness shall mean any

Persons under Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X or any schedules required by Regulation S-X or
contain separate financial statements for the Issuer, the Guarantors or other Affiliates the shares
of which are pledged to secure the Notes or any Note Guarantee that would be required under
Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC or comply
with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, (iii) in no event shall such information and reports be required
to comply with Regulation G under the Exchange Act or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K
promulgated by the SEC with respect to any non-GAAP financial measures contained therein,
(iv) in no event shall such information and reports be required to include any information that is
not otherwise similar to information included in the Offering Memorandum, other than
information specifically required under clause (2) above, or to contain any ‘‘segment reporting’’ or

285


-----

any earnings per share information, (v) no such information and reports referenced under
clause (2) above shall be required to be furnished if the Issuer determines in its good faith
judgment that the information or event is not material to the Holders or the business, assets,
operations or financial position of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
would otherwise cause competitive harm, or would otherwise constitute trade secrets, privileged or
confidential information obtained from another Person and other proprietary information, (vi) in
no event shall information and reports referenced in clause (2) above be required to include as an
exhibit copies of any agreements, financial statements or other items that would be required to be
filed as an exhibit to a current report on Form 8-K, an annual report on Form 10-K or a quarterly
report on Form 10-Q, including copies or a summary of the terms of any employment or
compensatory arrangement agreement, plan or understanding between the Issuer (or any of its
Subsidiaries) and any director, manager or executive officer, of the Issuer (or any of its
Subsidiaries) and (vii) no current report will be required to be provided in connection with the
Transactions; provided, further, that in the event that the Issuer elects to change its fiscal year end,
(w) the Issuer shall not be required to provide annual audited financial statements for the year
ended or ending on the date of its previous fiscal year end and shall only be required to furnish
quarterly financial statements and information for the quarter ended or ending on the date of its
previous fiscal year end, (x) the next period for which the Issuer shall be required to provide
annual audited financial statements and other information described in clause (1) above shall be
the twelve months ended on the date of its newly selected fiscal year end first occurring after such
election and, in connection therewith, the Issuer shall also be required to provide comparative
unaudited financial statements for the prior comparable twelve month period and a customary
‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’, (y) the
Issuer shall be required to provide quarterly financial statements and information described in
clause (1) above for the fiscal quarter(s) ended or ending (based on its newly selected fiscal year
end) during the period between the date of its previous fiscal year end and the date of its newly
selected fiscal year end first occurring after such election (such period, a ‘‘Transition Period’’) and
(z) other than as set forth in foregoing clause (y), the Issuer shall not be required to provide any
financial statements (whether audited or unaudited), information or reports for the Transition
Period (whether on Form 10-K/T, 10-Q/T or otherwise).

All such annual information and reports shall be furnished within 120 days after the end of the
fiscal year to which they relate (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business
Day), and all such quarterly information shall be furnished within 60 days after the end of the first
three fiscal quarters of the fiscal year to which they relate (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the
next succeeding Business Day); provided that the annual information and report for the first fiscal year
ending after the Effective Date shall be furnished within 150 days after the end of such fiscal year, and
_provided further that the quarterly information for first three fiscal quarters ending after, the Effective_
Date shall be furnished within 75 days after the end of such applicable fiscal quarter.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and if any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or if all Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information
required by the preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either (i) on the
face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, (ii) in ‘‘Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ or (iii) in any other comparable section, of
the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate
from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

The Issuer will make available such information and reports (as well as the details regarding the
conference call described below) to the Trustee under the Indenture, to any Holder of the Notes and,
upon request, to any beneficial owner of the Notes, in each case by posting such information and

286


-----

reports on its or any Parent Company’s website or a non-public password-protected website or online
data system maintained by the Issuer (or any Parent Company) or a third party which will require a
confidentiality acknowledgment, and will make such information and reports readily available to any
Holder of the Notes, any bona fide prospective investor in the Notes, any securities analyst (to the
extent providing analysis of investment in the Notes) or any market maker in the Notes, in each case,
who agrees to treat such information as confidential or accesses such information and reports on such
password-protected website or online data system which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment;
_provided that the Issuer shall post such information and reports thereon and make readily available any_
password or other login information to any such Holder of the Notes, bona fide prospective investor,
securities analyst or market maker; provided, further, that the Issuer may deny access to any
competitively-sensitive information or reports otherwise to be provided pursuant to this paragraph to
any such Holder, bona fide prospective investor, security analyst or market maker that is a competitor
of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries to the extent that the Issuer determines in good faith that the
provision of such information or reports to such Person would be competitively harmful to the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries; and provided, further, that such Holders, bona fide prospective investors, security
analysts or market makers shall agree to (i) treat all such reports (and the information contained
therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and the information contained
therein for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (iii) not
publicly disclose any such reports (and the information contained therein).

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will also:

(1) after:

(i) furnishing to the Holders the annual and quarterly information and reports required
by clause (1) of the first paragraph of this ‘‘Reports and Other Information’’ covenant or

(ii) furnishing to the Holders, at the option and in the sole discretion of the Issuer (who
shall not be obligated to so furnish), a summary condensed consolidated annual or quarterly
income statement and balance sheet, as applicable, without notes thereto, and a summary
discussion of the results of operations for the relevant reporting period,

promptly hold a conference call to discuss such information and reports or summary information
and the results of operations for the relevant reporting period (which conference call, for the
avoidance of doubt, may be held prior to such time that the annual or quarterly information and
reports required by clause (1) of the first paragraph of this ‘‘Reports and Other Information’’
covenant are furnished to Holders); and

(2) announce by press release to the appropriate nationally recognized wire services or post
to the website of the Issuer (or any Parent Company) or on a non-public, password-protected
website or online data system maintained by the Issuer (or any Parent Company) or a third party
prior to the date of the conference call required to be held in accordance with clause (1) of this
paragraph, the time and date of such conference call and either including all information necessary
to access the call or informing Holders, bona fide prospective investors, market makers and
securities analysts how they can obtain such information.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to prospective investors, upon their request, any information
required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so long as the Notes are
not freely transferable under the Securities Act.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the sole remedy for an Event of Default
relating to the failure to comply with the reporting obligations described under this covenant, will for
the 365 days after the occurrence of such Event of Default consist exclusively, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, of the right to receive additional interest on the principal amount of the Notes at a
rate equal to 0.50% per annum. This additional interest will be payable in the same manner and

287


-----

subject to the same terms as other interest payable under the Indenture. This additional interest will
accrue on all outstanding Notes from and including the date on which an Event of Default relating to a
failure to comply with the reporting obligations described above this covenant first occurs to, but
excluding the 365th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which the Event of Default relating to such
reporting obligations is cured or waived). If the Event of Default resulting from such failure to comply
with the reporting obligations is continuing on such 365th day, such additional interest will cease to
accrue and the Notes will be subject to the other remedies provided under the heading ‘‘—Events of
Default and Remedies.’’

Any Parent Company may satisfy the obligations of the Issuer set forth in this ‘‘Reports and Other
Information’’ covenant by providing the requisite financial and other information of such Parent
Company instead of the Issuer; provided that if such Parent Company is not a Guarantor, to the extent
such Parent Company holds assets (other than its direct or indirect interest in the Issuer) that exceeds
the lesser of (i) 1% of the Consolidated Total Assets of such Parent Company and (ii) 1% of the total
revenue for the preceding fiscal year of such Parent Company, then such information related to such
Parent Company shall be accompanied by consolidating information, which may be posted to the
website of the Issuer (or any Parent Company) or on a non-public, password-protected website or
online data system maintained by the Issuer (or any Parent Company) or a third party, that explains in
reasonable detail the differences between the information of such Parent Company, on the one hand,
and the information relating to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other
hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the
preceding sentence need not be audited or reviewed by the auditors.

The Issuer will be deemed to have furnished the financial statements and other information
referred to in the first paragraph of this covenant if the Issuer or any Parent Company has filed reports
containing such information (or any such information of a Parent Company in accordance with the
immediately preceding paragraph) with the SEC.

**_Additional Note Guarantees_**

From and after the Effective Date, the Issuer will not permit any of its Domestic Subsidiaries that
is a Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Guarantors and any Receivables Subsidiary)
to (i) borrow or guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities,
(ii) guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness under any Credit Facility incurred by the Issuer or any
Guarantor under clause (1) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ in an aggregate principal amount
in excess of $350.0 million, or (iii) guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness under any other capital
markets debt securities of the Issuer or any Guarantor in an aggregate principal amount in excess of
$350.0 million, unless such Subsidiary within 60 days executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to
the Indenture providing for a Note Guarantee by such Subsidiary; provided that this covenant shall not
be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such
Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary. The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any
Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, (and no 60-day
period described in the foregoing sentence shall apply to such Subsidiary).

Each Note Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture
described under ‘‘Note Guarantees.’’

288

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following events is an ‘‘Event of Default’’ under the Indenture:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of
principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the
Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after receipt of written
notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding (with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or
agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) or (2) above) contained in the
Indenture or the Notes; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture
provisions described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,’’ such period
of continuance of such default or breach shall be 180 days after written notice described in this
clause (3) has been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by
which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, any
Permitted Receivables Financing or, with respect to Indebtedness consisting of Hedging
Obligations, termination events or equivalent events pursuant to the terms of the relevant Hedge
Agreement which are not the result of any default thereunder by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of
the Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness
at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an
obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated
final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such
Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated final maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, is in the aggregate equal to $200.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent);

(5) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary (other
than any Receivables Subsidiary) (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as determined
as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end
provided as required under ‘‘—Reports and Other Information’’) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary, other than any Receivables Subsidiary) to pay final non-appealable judgments
aggregating in excess of $200.0 million (to the extent not covered by insurance as to which the
insurer has been notified of such judgment or order and has not denied its obligation), which final
non-appealable judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than
60 days after such judgment becomes final and non-appealable, and, in the event such judgment is
covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such
judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary (other than any Receivables Subsidiary) (or
group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as determined as of the most recent consolidated

289


-----

financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Reports and Other Information’’) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other than
any Receivables Subsidiary) (the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’);

(7) any Note Guarantee of Holdings or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant
Subsidiary (or group of Subsidiary Guarantors that together (as determined as of the most recent
consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information’’) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary) ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such
Note Guarantee) or Holdings or any such Subsidiary Guarantor or such group of Subsidiary
Guarantors denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee (other than by reason of
the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture and discharge of the Indenture or the
release of such Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture); or

(8) the failure by the Merger Sub to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption, to the
extent required, as described under ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above with respect to the
Issuer) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in
aggregate principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if
any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and
payable immediately. Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, a notice of Default
may not be given with respect to any action taken, any inaction that occurred or any event that took
place and, in each case, was either reported publicly or reported to Holders, more than two years prior
to such notice of Default.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable
immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6)
of the first paragraph of this section with respect to the Issuer, the principal of and interest on all
outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. If a Default occurs
and is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must send to each Holder notice of
the Default within 90 days after it becomes known to the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that the
Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to
the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it in good faith determines that withholding
notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in
the reasonable judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the interest of the Holders.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive
any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing
Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any
Note held by a non-consenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration and its consequences; provided
such rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all
consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of
the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee
or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been
discharged; or

(2) the requisite holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action
(as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

290


-----

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case
an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of
the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless the
Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against
any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if
any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Notes or the
Indenture unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Notes
have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy;

(3) Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof
and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the total then outstanding Notes
have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

These limitations do not apply, however, to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note for the
enforcement of payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Note on or after the
respective due date expressed in such Note.

Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of
Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a ‘‘Noteholder Direction’’) provided by any one
or more Holders (each a ‘‘Directing Holder’’) must be accompanied by a written representation from
each such Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is
DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net
Short (a ‘‘Position Representation’’), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating
to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is
cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder
must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other
information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of
such Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a ‘‘Verification
_Covenant’’). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or_
Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu
of DTC or its nominee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the
Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe that a Directing Holder was,
at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that the Issuer has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a
determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation,
and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction,
the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and
non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the
delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to
the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant,
the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with

291


-----

respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be
automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant.
Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such
Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the
percentage of the Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would
have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be
void _ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred,_
acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or
any notice of such Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder
Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a
bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraph.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder
Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or
investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification
Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make
calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long
Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability to
the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power
conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with
law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other
Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability.

The Issuer will be required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal
year (beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Effective Date and after giving effect to any
fiscal year end change effected on or after the Effective Date), an Officer’s Certificate indicating
whether the signer of the certificate knows of any failure by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to
comply with all conditions and covenants of the Indenture during such fiscal year. In addition, the
Issuer is required within 30 days of becoming aware of any Default to deliver to the Trustee a
statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or waived within such 30-day
time period).

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with another default (such other default, the ‘‘Initial Default’’) occurs,
then at the time such Initial Default is cured, the Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action
and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed
under ‘‘—Reports and Other Information’’ or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to
any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report
required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not
within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Any time period in the Indenture to cure any
actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Managers, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or
stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any of their parent companies or entities, as such, shall

292


-----

have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Note
Guarantees, the Indenture or the Escrow Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting Notes waives and releases all
such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such
waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the
SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture, the Notes and the Note
Guarantees, will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released upon payment in full of
all of the Notes issued under the Indenture. The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to
have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the Notes and have each Guarantor’s obligation
discharged with respect to its Note Guarantee (‘‘Legal Defeasance’’) and cure all then existing Events of
Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust
created pursuant to the Indenture;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an
office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s
obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of
each Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are set forth
in the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees, as the case may be (‘‘Covenant Defeasance’’), and
thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default or Event of
Default. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy,
receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Issuer) described under ‘‘Events of
Default and Remedies’’ will no longer constitute an Event of Default.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the
Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination
thereof, in such amounts (including scheduled payments thereon) as will be sufficient, in the
opinion of an Independent Financial Advisor, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest
due on the Notes on the stated maturity date or on the Redemption Date, as the case may be, of
such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes and the Issuer must specify whether
such Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular Redemption Date; provided that upon
any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall
be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the
Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium, calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption,
with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the ‘‘Applicable Premium Deficit’’)
only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee
simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

293


-----

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion
of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions
and exclusions,

(a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the United States
Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or

(b) since the issuance of the Notes, there has been a change in the applicable U.S.
federal income tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that,
subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders of the Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not
occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions, the Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be
applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other
Indebtedness, and, in each case the granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have occurred
and be continuing on the date of such deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation
of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or material instrument (other than the
Indenture) to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any
Guarantor is bound (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such
deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case,
the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(6) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the
deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding
any creditors of the Issuer or any Guarantor or others; and

(7) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each
stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the
Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes, when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except mutilated, destroyed, lost
or stolen Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has
theretofore been deposited in trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) (w) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise,

294


-----

(ii) will become due and payable within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption
within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of
notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer;

(x) the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited
with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes,
cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, in an
amount (including scheduled payments thereon) sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
Indebtedness on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for
principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of
Notes which have become due and payable) or to the date of maturity or redemption, as
the case may be; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the
Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the
Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the
Applicable Premium, calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any
Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to
the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable
Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied
toward such redemption;

(y) no Default or Event of Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds
to be applied to make such deposit or any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to
other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall
have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or shall occur as a result of
such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under any material agreement or material instrument (other than the Indenture)
to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor
is bound (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such
deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in
each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith); and

(z) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the
deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or the Redemption Date,
as the case may be.

(2) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable by it under the Indenture;
and

(3) the Issuer has delivered an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which
Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) to the Trustee
stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes, any Note
Guarantee and the Escrow Agreement may be amended or supplemented and any existing Default or
Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes, any Note Guarantee or
the Escrow Agreement may be waived, in each case, with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, other than Notes beneficially
owned by the Issuer or its Affiliates (excluding any Debt Fund Affiliate), including consents or waivers
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer (including a Change of Control Offer) or
exchange offer for, the Notes.

295


-----

The Indenture will provide that, without the consent of each affected Holder, an amendment or
waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such Note or reduce the
premium payable upon the redemption of such Notes or change the time at which such Notes may
be redeemed as described under ‘‘—Optional Redemption;’’ provided that any amendment to the
minimum notice requirement may be made with the consent of the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding;

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in (a) the payment of principal of or premium, if
any, or interest on the Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes and a waiver of the
payment default that resulted from such acceleration, or (b) in respect of a covenant or provision
contained in the Indenture or any Note Guarantee which cannot be amended or modified without
the consent of all affected Holders;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults
or the rights of Holders to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the
Notes;

(7) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions;

(8) amend the contractual right expressly set forth in the Indenture or any Note of any
Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and
interest on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(9) make any change to or modify the ranking of the Notes that would adversely affect the
Holders; or

(10) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Note Guarantees of any
Significant Subsidiary in any manner materially adverse to the Holders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, any Guarantor (only with respect to its Note Guarantee,
and excluding any amendment or supplement the sole purpose of which is to add an additional
Guarantor) and the Trustee, without the consent of any Holders, may amend the Notes, the Note
Guarantee, the Indenture and the Escrow Agreement for any of the following purposes:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(3) to comply with the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger,
Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets;’’

(4) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s obligations to the
Holders pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including an assumption of Merger Sub’s
obligations pursuant to the Escrow Agreement);

(5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of
Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder in
any material respect;

296


-----

(6) to add covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power
conferred upon the Issuer or any Guarantor;

(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture;

successor Trustee or a successor paying agent thereunder pursuant to the requirements thereof;

(10) to add a Guarantor, a guarantee of a Parent Company or a co-obligor of the Notes under
the Indenture;

(11) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees to any provision
of this ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes’’ to the extent that such provision in this ‘‘Description of
Unsecured Notes’’ was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the
Notes or the Note Guarantees;

(12) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and
legending of Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the
issuance and administration of the Notes; provided, however, that such amendment does not
materially and adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes;

(13) to secure the Notes and/or the related Note Guarantees;

(14) to release any Guarantor from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the Indenture when
permitted or required by the Indenture;

and including any release of any lien that is not then otherwise required by the Indenture to be
pledged as security for the Notes); or

(16) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, the Notes held by all Debt Fund
Affiliates shall not account for more than 49.9% of the principal amounts of outstanding Notes
included in determining whether the Holders have (A) consented to any amendment, modification,
waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of the Indenture therefrom,
(B) otherwise acted on any matter related to the Indenture or (C) directed or required the Trustee to
undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under the Indenture; it
being understood and agreed that the portion of the Notes that accounts for more than 49.9% of the
relevant requisite principal amount of outstanding Notes shall be deemed to be not outstanding for all
such purposes.

**Notices**

Notices given by publication (including posting of information as contemplated by the provisions
described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information’’) will be deemed given on the
first date on which publication is made and notices given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, will be
deemed given five calendar days after mailing or transmitting. Notices sent by overnight delivery service

297


-----

will be deemed given on the next Business Day after timely delivery to the courier and notices given
electronically will be deemed given when sent. Notice otherwise given in accordance with the
procedures of DTC will be deemed given on the date sent to DTC.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a
creditor of the Issuer or a Guarantor, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on
certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be
permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must
eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue or resign as Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The
Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default shall occur (which shall not be cured), the
Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person
under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. The Trustee will be under no obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless such
Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any
loss, liability or expense.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Escrow Agreement will be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

**Limited Condition Transactions**

In connection with any action being taken solely in connection with a Limited Condition
Transaction, for purposes of:

(a) determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture that requires the calculation
of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio or Consolidated Secured Debt
Ratio;

(b) determining whether a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
(or any subset of Defaults or Events of Default); or

(c) testing availability under baskets, ratios or financial metrics under the Indenture
(including those measured as a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA, Annualized EBITDA, Fixed
Charges or Consolidated Total Assets or by reference to clause (2)(a) of the first paragraph under
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’);

in each case, at the option of the Issuer, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, a Parent Company of the
Issuer, or any successor entity of any of the foregoing (including a third party) (the ‘‘Testing Party’’, and
the election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction, an ‘‘LCT
_Election’’), with such option to be exercised on or prior to the date of execution of the definitive_
agreements, submission of notice or the making of a definitive declaration, as applicable, with respect
to such Limited Condition Transaction, the date of determination of whether any such action is
permitted under the Indenture, shall be deemed to be (a) the date the definitive agreements (or, if
applicable, a binding offer or launch of a ‘‘certain funds’’ tender offer), notice (which may be
conditional) or declaration with respect to such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into,
provided or made, as applicable, or the date that an Officer’s Certificate is given with respect to the
designation of a Subsidiary as restricted or unrestricted, or (b) with respect to sales in connection with

298


-----

an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers applies (or similar
law or practice in other jurisdictions), the date on which a ‘‘Rule 2.7 announcement’’ of a firm intent to
make an offer or similar announcement or determination in another jurisdiction subject to laws similar
to the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (as applicable, the ‘‘LCT Test Date’’) is
made, and if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and the other
transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness or
Liens and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the most recent Test
Period ending prior to the LCT Test Date, the Issuer could have taken such action on the relevant LCT
Test Date in compliance with such ratio, basket or financial metric, such ratio, basket or financial
metric shall be deemed to have been complied with.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Testing Party has made an LCT Election and any of the ratios,
baskets or financial metrics for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date
are exceeded or not complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, basket or financial
metrics, including due to fluctuations in Fixed Charges, Consolidated Net Income or Annualized
EBITDA of the Issuer, the target company or the Person subject to such Limited Condition
Transaction, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such ratios, baskets
or financial metrics will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations and such
baskets, ratios or financial metrics shall not be tested at the consummation of the Limited Condition
Transaction except as contemplated in clause (a) of the immediately succeeding proviso; provided,
_however, that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become_
available, the Testing Party may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine all such baskets, ratios and
financial metrics on the basis of such financial statements, in which case such date of redetermination
shall thereafter be deemed to be the applicable LCT Test Date, (b) if any ratios or financial metrics
improve or baskets increase as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios, financial metrics or
baskets may be utilized and (c) Fixed Charges with respect to any Indebtedness expected to be incurred
in connection with such Limited Condition Transaction will, for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, be calculated using an assumed interest rate based on the available documentation therefor, as
determined by the Testing Party in good faith. If the Testing Party has made an LCT Election for any
Limited Condition Transaction, then, in connection with any subsequent calculation of the ratios,
baskets or financial metrics on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of
(i) the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or (ii) the date that the
definitive agreement, notice or declaration for such Limited Condition Transaction is abandoned,
terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio,
basket or financial metric shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming such Limited Condition
Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness
or Liens and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
Testing Party has exercised its option pursuant to the foregoing and any Default or Event of Default
occurs following the LCT Test Date (including any new LCT Test Date) for the applicable Limited
Condition Transaction and prior to or on the date of the consummation of such Limited Condition
Transaction, any such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be
continuing for purposes of determining whether any action being taken in connection with such Limited
Condition Transaction is permitted under the Indenture.

**Certain Compliance Determinations**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the succeeding two paragraphs in
this section and ‘‘Limited Condition Transactions’’ above, all financial ratios, tests, covenants,
calculations and measurements (including, without limitation, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Interest Expense, Fixed
Charges, Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated EBITDA, Annualized
EBITDA, any Fixed Amount (as defined below) or Incurrence-Based Amount (as defined below))

299


-----

contained in the Indenture that are calculated with respect to any period during which the Transactions
or any Subject Transaction occurs shall be calculated with respect to such period and the Transactions
and each such Subject Transaction on a pro forma basis and may be determined with reference to the
financial statements of a Parent Company of the Issuer instead, so long as such Parent Company does
not hold any material assets other than, directly or indirectly, the Equity Interests of the Issuer (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or senior management of the Issuer (or any Parent
Company of the Issuer)). Further, if, since the beginning of any such period and on or prior to the date
of any required calculation of any financial ratio, test, covenant, calculation or measurement (i) any
Subject Transaction has occurred or (ii) any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or
was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
or any joint venture since the beginning of such period has consummated any Subject Transaction, then,
in each case, any applicable financial ratio, test, covenant, calculation or measurement shall be
calculated on a pro forma basis for such period as if such Subject Transaction (including, without
duplication of any amounts otherwise reflected in Consolidated EBITDA for the applicable Test Period,
any Run Rate Benefits and the ‘‘run rate’’ income described, and calculated as set forth, in clause (e)(i)
of the definition of Consolidated EBITDA) had occurred at the beginning of the applicable period.

For purposes of determining the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event that
requires a calculation of any Fixed Amounts, Incurrence-Based Amounts or financial ratio, test
covenant, calculation or measurement (including, without limitation, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Interest Expense, Fixed
Charges, Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated EBITDA and Annualized
EBITDA), such Fixed Amounts, Incurrence-Based Amounts or financial ratio, test, covenant,
calculation or measurement shall be calculated at the time such action is taken (subject to ‘‘—Limited
Condition Transactions’’ above), such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event
occurs, as the case may be, and no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred
solely as a result of a change in such Fixed Amounts, Incurrence-Based Amounts or financial ratio,
test, covenant, calculation or measurement occurring after the time such action is taken, such change is
made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, with respect to any amounts incurred
or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Indenture (including
any covenant) that does not require compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, without
limitation, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and/or Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio) (any such amounts, the ‘‘Fixed Amounts’’) substantially concurrently with any amounts
incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Indenture that
requires compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, Consolidated Secured
Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and/or Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) (any such amounts,
the ‘‘Incurrence-Based Amounts’’), it is understood and agreed that the Fixed Amounts shall be
disregarded in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to the Incurrence-Based Amounts.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, in the event an item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is
incurred or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on an Incurrence-Based Amount, such
Incurrence-Based Amount shall be calculated without regard to the incurrence of any Indebtedness
under any revolving facility or letter of credit facility (i) immediately prior to or in connection
therewith or (ii) used to finance working capital needs of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as
reasonably determined by the Issuer).

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, so long as an action was taken (or not
taken) in reliance upon a basket, ratio or test under the Indenture that was calculated or determined in
good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer based upon financial
information available to such officer at such time and such action (or inaction) was permitted under

300


-----

the Indenture at the time of such calculation or determination, any subsequent restatement,
modification or adjustments made to such financial information (including any restatement,
modification or adjustment that would have caused such basket, ratio or test to be exceeded as a result
of such action or inaction) shall not result in any Default or Event of Default under the Indenture.

For purposes of determining compliance at any time with the covenants under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock,’’ ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted
Payments,’’ ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries,’’ ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,’’ ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Transactions with Affiliates’’ and the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investments,’’ in the event that any
Indebtedness, Permitted Lien, Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment, disposition or Affiliate
Transaction, as applicable, meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of transactions or
items permitted pursuant to the first paragraph or any clause of the second paragraph under
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock’’ (provided that all Indebtedness represented by term loans outstanding under the
Senior Credit Facilities on the Effective Date (after giving effect to the Transactions) will be treated as
incurred on the Effective Date under clause (a) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock’’), any clause of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens’’, clause (2) of the first paragraph or any
clause of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,’’ any
clause of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Dividend and Other Payment
Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ any clause of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investment’’,
any clause of the definition of ‘‘Asset Sale’’ and any dispositions constituting exceptions thereto and any
clause under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Transactions with Affiliates’’, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, may,
from time to time, classify or reclassify such transaction or item (or portion thereof) and will only be
required to include the amount and type of such transaction (or portion thereof) in any one category;
_provided that the reclassification described in this sentence shall be deemed to have occurred_
automatically with respect to any such transaction or item incurred or made pursuant to a Fixed
Amount that later would be permitted on a pro forma basis to be incurred or made pursuant to an
Incurrence-Based Amount. It is understood and agreed that any Indebtedness, Permitted Lien,
Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment, disposition and/or Affiliate Transaction need not be
permitted solely by reference to one category of permitted Indebtedness, Permitted Lien, Restricted
Payment, Permitted Investment, disposition and/or Affiliate Transaction under such sections,
respectively, but may instead be permitted in part under any combination thereof.

For purposes of any determination under the Indenture (other than the calculation of compliance
with any financial ratio for purposes of taking any action under the Indenture) with respect to the
amount of any Indebtedness, Lien, Restricted Payment, Restricted Debt Payment, Investment, Asset
Sale, Sale and Lease-Back Transaction, Affiliate transaction or other transaction, event or circumstance,
or any determination under any other provision of the Indenture (any of the foregoing, a ‘‘specified
_transaction’’) requiring the use of a current exchange rate, (i) the equivalent amount in U.S. dollars of_
a specified transaction in a currency other than U.S. dollars shall be calculated based on the rate of
exchange quoted by the Bloomberg Foreign Exchange Rates & World Currencies Page (or any
successor page thereto, or in the event such rate does not appear on any Bloomberg Page, by reference
to such other publicly available service for displaying exchange rates as may be determined by the
Issuer in good faith) for such foreign currency (the ‘‘Exchange Rate’’), as in effect at 11:00 a.m.
(London time) on the date of such determination (which, in the case of any Restricted Payment, shall
be deemed to be the date of the declaration thereof and, in the case of the incurrence of Indebtedness,
shall be deemed to be on the date first committed); _provided, that if any Indebtedness is incurred (and,_
if applicable, associated Lien granted) to refinance or replace other Indebtedness denominated in a
currency other than U.S. dollars, and the relevant refinancing or replacement would cause the

301


-----

applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency
Exchange Rate in effect on the date of such refinancing or replacement, such U.S. dollar-denominated
restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such
refinancing or replacement Indebtedness (and, if applicable, associated Lien granted) does not exceed
an amount sufficient to repay the principal amount of the Refinanced Indebtedness, except by an
amount equal to (x) unpaid accrued interest and premiums (including premiums) thereon plus other
reasonable and customary fees and expenses (including upfront fees and original issue discount)
incurred in connection with such refinancing or replacement, (y) any existing unutilized commitments
and letters of credit undrawn thereunder and (z) additional amounts permitted to be incurred under
the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ and (i) for the avoidance of doubt, no Default or
Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in the Exchange Rate
occurring after the time of any specified transaction so long as such specified transaction was permitted
at the time incurred, made, acquired, committed, entered or declared as set forth in clause (i). For
purposes of the calculation of compliance with any financial ratio for purposes of taking any action
under the Indenture, on any relevant date of determination, amounts denominated in currencies other
than U.S. dollars shall be translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable Exchange Rate used in
preparing the financial statements delivered pursuant to the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Reports and Other Information’’ (or, prior to the first such delivery, the most recent
internally available financial statements), as applicable, for the relevant Test Period and will, with
respect to any Indebtedness, reflect the currency translation effects, determined in accordance with
GAAP, of any Hedge Agreement permitted under the Indenture in respect of currency exchange risks
with respect to the applicable currency in effect on the date of determination for the U.S. dollar
equivalent amount of such Indebtedness.

For purposes of the calculation of the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt
Ratio and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, in connection with the incurrence of any Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,’’ such Person may elect, pursuant to an
Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee, to treat all or any portion of the commitment (such
amount elected until revoked as described below, the ‘‘Elected Amount’’) under any Indebtedness which
is to be incurred (or any commitment in respect thereof) or secured by such Lien (whether by the
Issuer, its Restricted Subsidiaries or any third party), as the case may be, as being incurred or secured,
as the case may be, as of the date of determination and (i) any subsequent incurrence of such
Indebtedness under such commitment that was so treated (so long as the total amount under such
Indebtedness does not exceed the Elected Amount) shall not be deemed, for purposes of this
calculation, to be an incurrence of additional Indebtedness or an additional Lien at such subsequent
time, (ii) such Person may revoke an election of an Elected Amount pursuant to an Officer’s
Certificate delivered to the Trustee and (iii) for subsequent calculations of the Consolidated Secured
Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Elected Amount (if
any) shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually outstanding.

For all purposes under the Indenture, in connection with any division or plan of division under
Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction’s laws): (a) if any asset, right,
obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person,
then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person,
and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been
organized on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Capital Stock at such time.

-----

**Certain Definitions**

Set forth below are certain defined terms to be used in the Indenture. For purposes of the
Indenture, unless otherwise specifically indicated, the term ‘‘consolidated’’ with respect to any Person
refers to such Person on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, but excluding from such
consolidation any Unrestricted Subsidiary as if such Unrestricted Subsidiary were not an Affiliate of
such Person.

‘‘Acquired Indebtedness’’ means, with respect to any specified Person,

(1) Indebtedness of any other Person existing at the time such other Person is merged,
consolidated or amalgamated with or into or became a Restricted Subsidiary of such specified
Person, including Indebtedness incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such other
Person merging, consolidating or amalgamating with or into or becoming a Restricted Subsidiary of
such specified Person, and

(2) Indebtedness secured by a Lien encumbering any asset acquired by such specified Person.

‘‘Additional Assets’’ means (1) any property or other assets used or useful in a Similar Business,
(2) the Capital Stock of a Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as a result of the
acquisition of such Capital Stock by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary or (3) Capital Stock
constituting a minority interest in any Person that at such time is a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer;
_provided, however, that any Restricted Subsidiary described in clause (2) or (3) above is engaged in a_
Similar Business.

‘‘Affiliate’’ means, as applied to any Person, any other Person directly or indirectly Controlling,

(collectively, the ‘‘Participants’’) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those
securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants.
The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers or affiliates
thereof), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to
DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that
clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly
(collectively, the ‘‘Indirect Participants’’). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own
securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The
ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of
DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

  - upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of the Participants designated by
the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and

   - ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership
of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the
Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of
beneficial interests in the Global Notes).

Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein
directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold
their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg) that are Participants. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their
interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg if they are participants in such
systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Restricted
Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through
Participants in DTC other than Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants
through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective
depositories, which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’
names on the books of DTC. Citibank, N.A. acts as depositary for Clearstream, Luxembourg, and
Euroclear S.A./N.V. acts as depositary for Euroclear. All interests in a Global Note, including those
held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, may be subject to the procedures and
requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg may also
be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that
certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons will be limited to that extent.
Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect
Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests
to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such
interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.

357


-----

**Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in**
**their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered**
**the registered owners or ‘‘holders’’ thereof under the indentures governing the notes for any purpose.**

Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on a Global Note
registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered
holder under the indentures that will govern the notes. Under the terms of the indentures that will
govern the notes, we and the trustee thereunder will treat the persons in whose names the notes,
including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving
payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither we nor any agent of ours or either trustee
has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

   - any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to, or
payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect
Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or

   - any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or
Indirect Participants.

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities
such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants
with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive
payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to
its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the
records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of
notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of
the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be our responsibility or the responsibility of
DTC or either trustee. Neither we nor the trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of the
Participants or the Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and we and
the trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its
nominee for all purposes.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions,’’ transfers between the
Participants will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures and will be settled in same-day
funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will be effected in
accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, crossmarket transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream,
Luxembourg participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s
rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, by its respective
depositary. However, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or
Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with
the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear
or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement
requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on
its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or
receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to
DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream, Luxembourg participants may not deliver instructions
directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at
the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the
Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to

358


-----

which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of
default under any of the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes in respect of such
notes for legended notes in certificated form and to distribute such notes to its Participants.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg have agreed to the foregoing procedures
to facilitate transfers of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes
among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, they are under no obligation to
perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time.
Neither we nor the trustee nor any of our or its agents will have any responsibility for the performance
by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or their respective participants or indirect participants
of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Notes if:

   - DTC (1) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes
or (2) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case,
we fail to appoint a successor depositary; or

   - there has occurred and is continuing an event of default with respect to such notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon
prior written notice given to the trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indentures that
will govern the notes. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or
beneficial interests in Global Notes will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved
denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary
procedures) and will bear a restrictive legend referred to in ‘‘Transfer Restrictions,’’ unless that legend
is not required by applicable law.

**Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes**

Certificated Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless the
transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indentures that
will govern the notes) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer
restrictions applicable to such notes.

**Exchanges Between Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global
Notes may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes only if:

  - such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

   - the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the
indentures that will govern the notes) to the effect that the notes are being transferred to a
person:

(i) who the transferor reasonably believes to be a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A;

(ii) purchasing for its own account or the account of a QIB in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A; and

(iii) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other
jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Notes, whether before or after the expiration of
the Restricted Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form

359


-----

provided in the indentures that will govern the notes) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) and that, if such transfer
occurs prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, the interest transferred will be held immediately
thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and
the Rule 144A Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the
indenture trustee through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection
with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal
amount of the Regulation S Global Notes and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the
Rule 144A Global Notes or vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes
that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note
will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other
Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures
applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.
The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S
Global Notes prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period.

**Certifications by Holders of the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes**

A holder of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes must provide
Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, with a certificate in the form required by
the indentures that will govern the notes certifying that the beneficial owner of the interest in the
Regulation S Temporary Global Notes is either a non-U.S. person or a U.S. person that has purchased
such interest in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act
and Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, must deliver to the trustee (or the
paying agent if other than such trustee) a certificate in the form required by the indentures that will
govern the notes, prior to any exchange of such beneficial interest for a beneficial interest in the
Regulation S Permanent Global Notes.

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

We will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes (including
principal, premium, if any, and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
specified by DTC or its nominee. We will make all payments of principal, interest and premium, if any,
with respect to Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
specified by the holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check
to each such holder’s registered address. The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be
eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market
trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available
funds. We expect that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately
available funds.

Because of time-zone differences, credits of interests in the Global Notes received in Clearstream,
Luxembourg or Euroclear as a result of a transaction with a DTC Participant will be made during
subsequent securities settlement processing and dated the business day following the DTC settlement
date. Such credits or any transactions involving interests in such Global Notes settled during such
processing will be reported to the relevant Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear participants on such
business day. Cash received in Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear as a result of sales of interests in
the Global Notes by or through a Clearstream, Luxembourg participant or a Euroclear Participant to a
DTC Participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the
relevant Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear cash account only as of the business day following
settlement in DTC.

-----

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The issuance and sale of the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any other
applicable securities laws (and we are under no obligation to so register the notes), and may not be
offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred within the United States or to, or for the account or
benefit of, any U.S. person, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to,
the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws.
Accordingly, each series of notes are being offered, sold and issued only (i) to persons reasonably
believed to be ‘‘qualified institutional buyers’’ (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act,
‘‘QIBs’’), in a private transaction in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A and any other applicable securities laws, and (ii) outside the
United States to persons other than U.S. persons who will be required to make certain representations
to us and others prior to the investment in such series of notes in reliance upon Regulation S under
the Securities Act.

Each purchaser of notes is subject to restrictions on transfer as summarized below. By purchasing
notes, each purchaser (and in the case of clause (7), each transferee of the notes) will be deemed to
represent, warrant, acknowledge and agree as follows (terms used in this paragraph that are defined in
Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act are used herein as defined therein):

(1) It is not an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Company or any
of the guarantors, that the purchaser is not acting on its behalf and that it either (A) (i) is a
QIB, (ii) is acquiring the notes for its own account or for the account of a QIB and (iii) is
aware that the initial purchasers are selling the notes to it in reliance on Rule 144A or (B) is
not a U.S. person and is acquiring the notes in an offshore transaction pursuant to
Regulation S.

(2) It understands that the notes are being offered in a transaction not involving any public
offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act, that the notes have not
been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and that (A) if in the future it
decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any of the notes, such notes may be
offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred only (i) for so long as the notes are eligible
for resale under Rule 144A, to a person whom the seller reasonably believes is a QIB that is
purchasing for its own account or for the account of another QIB in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A, (ii) outside the United States in a transaction complying with the
provisions of Rule 904 under the Securities Act, (iii) pursuant to an exemption from
registration under the Securities Act, (iv) pursuant to an effective registration statement under
the Securities Act or (v) to us or any of our subsidiaries, in each of cases (i) through (v) in
accordance with any applicable securities laws of any State of the United States, and that
(B) it will, and each subsequent holder is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser of the
notes from it of the resale restrictions referred to in clause (A) above.

The purchaser also acknowledges that we and the Trustee reserve the right to require in
connection with any offer, sale or other transfer of notes under clauses (A)(ii) and (iii) above
the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certifications and/or other information satisfactory to us
and the Trustee.

(3) It understands that the notes will, unless otherwise agreed by the issuer and the holder
thereof, bear a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT

ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR ANY
INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE REOFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED,

361


-----

TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE
ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT
FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECURITIES ACT. THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY, BY ITS ACCEPTANCE
HEREOF, AGREES ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ANY INVESTOR
ACCOUNT FOR WHICH IT HAS PURCHASED SECURITIES, TO OFFER, SELL OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFER SUCH SECURITY, ONLY (A) TO THE ISSUER OR ANY
SUBSIDIARY THEREOF, (B) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT
HAS BECOME OR BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT,
(C) FOR SO LONG AS THE SECURITIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE PURSUANT
TO RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, TO A PERSON IT REASONABLY
BELIEVES IS A ‘‘QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER’’ AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT THAT PURCHASES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR
FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER TO WHOM
NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON
RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (D) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND
SALES THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH
REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, OR (E) PURSUANT TO ANOTHER
AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECURITIES ACT, SUBJECT TO THE ISSUER’S AND THE TRUSTEE’S RIGHT PRIOR
TO ANY SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER PURSUANT TO CLAUSES (D) OR
(E) TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION
AND/ OR OTHER INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO EACH OF THEM.

Each note being sold pursuant to Regulation S will bear an additional legend substantially to
the following effect unless otherwise agreed by the issuer and the holder thereof:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ‘‘SECURITIES ACT’’), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF
ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION, AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR
DELIVERED IN THE UNITED STATES OR TO, OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OR
BENEFIT OF, ANY U.S. PERSON, UNLESS SUCH NOTES ARE REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OR AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS THEREOF IS AVAILABLE. THIS LEGEND WILL BE REMOVED
AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF FORTY DAYS FROM THE LATER OF (i) THE DATE
ON WHICH THESE NOTES WERE FIRST OFFERED AND (ii) THE DATE OF ISSUE
OF THESE NOTES.

(4) If such purchaser is an acquirer in a transaction that occurs outside the United States within
the meaning of Regulation S, you acknowledge that until the expiration of the ‘‘40-day
distribution compliance period’’ within the meaning of Rule 903 of Regulation S under the
Securities Act, any offer or sale of these notes shall not be made by such purchaser to a U.S.
person or for the account or benefit of a U.S. person within the meaning of Rule 902 under
the Securities Act, except in compliance with applicable securities laws.

(5) It (a) is able to act on its own behalf in the transactions contemplated by this offering
memorandum, (b) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to

prospective investment in the notes and can afford the complete loss of such investment.

(6) It acknowledges that (a) none of us, the initial purchasers or any person acting on behalf of
any of the foregoing has made any statement, representation, or warranty, express or implied,

362

to it with respect to the issuer or the offer or sale of any notes, other than the information we
have included in this offering memorandum, and (b) any information it desires concerning the
issuer, the notes or any other matter relevant to its decision to acquire the notes (including a
copy of the offering memorandum) is or has been made available to it.

(7) Either (i) it is not acquiring or holding such note (or any interest therein) with the assets of
any (a) employee benefit plan that is subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’), (b) plan, individual retirement account
or other arrangement that is subject to Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’) or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or
other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code
(collectively, ‘‘Similar Laws’’), or (c) entity whose underlying assets are considered to include
assets of any such plan, account or arrangement described in clause (a) or (b) pursuant to
ERISA or otherwise, or (ii) (A) the acquisition and holding of such note and any interest
therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar
Laws and (B) it acknowledges and agrees that none of the Issuer, the initial purchasers, nor

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income and, in the case of non-U.S.
holders (as defined below), estate tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the
notes as of the date of this offering memorandum. This summary deals only with notes held as capital
assets (generally, assets held for investment) by holders who purchase the notes for cash pursuant to
this offering at their initial ‘‘issue price’’ (the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is
sold to investors for cash (excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations
acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler)).

As used herein, a ‘‘U.S. holder’’ means a beneficial owner of the notes that is for United States
federal income tax purposes any of the following:

   - an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

   - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

   - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of
its source; or

   - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one
or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust
or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be
treated as a United States person.

Except as modified for estate tax purposes (as discussed below), as used herein, the term
‘‘non-U.S. holder’’ means a beneficial owner of the notes (other than an entity treated as a partnership
for United States federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. holder.

If any entity classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds the
notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an
investment in the notes, you should consult your own tax advisors.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax
consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal
income tax laws, including if you are:

   - a dealer in securities or currencies;

   - a financial institution;

  - a regulated investment company;

   - a real estate investment trust;

  - a tax-exempt organization;

  - an insurance company;

   - a person holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale
transaction or a straddle;

   - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your
securities;

   - a person liable for alternative minimum tax;

364


-----

   - a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes (or a
person who is an investor in such an entity);

   - a U.S. holder whose ‘‘functional currency’’ is not the U.S. dollar;

   - a ‘‘controlled foreign corporation’’;

   - a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the
notes as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement;

   - a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’; or

   - a United States expatriate.

This summary is based on the Code, United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and
judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a retroactive
basis, so as to result in United States federal income and estate tax consequences different from those
summarized below.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income and
estate tax consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the
Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the effects of any state, local or non-United
States tax laws. It is not intended to be, and should not be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any
particular purchaser of notes. If you are considering purchasing notes, you should consult your own tax
**advisors concerning the particular United States federal income and estate tax consequences to you of**
**the purchase, ownership or disposition of the notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under**
**any other federal tax laws and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**Merger Considerations**

We intend to take the position that the merger of Merger Sub with and into Zayo, with Zayo
continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings, and the related
assumption by Zayo of the obligations of Merger Sub under the notes, as described above under
‘‘Description of Secured Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of Unsecured Notes’’ (the ‘‘Merger’’) will not be a
taxable event to holders of the notes for United States federal income tax purposes. Our position,
however, is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS were to successfully challenge this position, the Merger
may be treated as a taxable event to holders of the notes in which holders recognize taxable gain or
loss for United States federal income tax purposes, and such taxable event could cause the amount and
timing of a holder’s income or gain with respect to the notes to differ from that otherwise described
herein. This discussion assumes that the Merger will not be treated as a taxable event for United States
federal income tax purposes for holders of the notes. Prospective holders should consult with their own
tax advisors regarding the possible United States federal income tax consequences of the Merger to
them.

**U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will
apply to you if you are a U.S. holder of the notes.

**_Stated Interest_**

Stated interest on the notes will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is
received or accrued, depending on your regular method of accounting for United States federal income
tax purposes.

365


-----

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note, you
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the
disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as
interest income as discussed above) and the adjusted tax basis of the note. Your adjusted tax basis in a
note will, in general, be your cost for that note. Any gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss.
Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets
held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations.

**Non-U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income and estate tax consequences
that will apply to non-U.S. holders of the notes.

**_United States Federal Withholding Tax_**

United States federal withholding tax will not apply to any payment of interest on the notes under
the ‘‘portfolio interest rule,’’ provided that:

   - interest paid on the notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business
in the United States;

  - you do not actually (or constructively) own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of
all classes of voting stock of the Issuer within the meaning of the Code and applicable United
States Treasury regulations;

   - you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to the Issuer through stock
ownership;

   - you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of
the Code; and

  - either (a) you provide your name and address on an applicable Internal Revenue Service
(‘‘IRS’’) Form W-8, and certify, under penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States
person as defined under the Code or (b) you hold your notes through certain foreign
intermediaries and satisfy the certification requirements of applicable United States Treasury
regulations. Special certification rules apply to non-U.S. holders that are pass-through entities
rather than corporations or individuals.

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be
subject to a 30% United States federal withholding tax, unless you provide the applicable withholding
agent with a properly executed:

  - IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8 BEN-E (or other applicable form) certifying an exemption from or
reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty; or

  - IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) certifying that interest paid on the notes is not
subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or
business in the United States (as discussed below under ‘‘—United States Federal Income Tax’’).

The 30% United States federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any payment of principal
or gain that you realize on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
note.

366


-----

**_United States Federal Income Tax_**

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the notes is
effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment or fixed base), then you
will be subject to United States federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis (although you
will be exempt from the 30% United States federal withholding tax, provided the certification
requirements discussed above in ‘‘—United States Federal Withholding Tax’’ are satisfied) in generally
the same manner as if you were a United States person as defined under the Code. In addition, if you
are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable
income tax treaty rate) of your effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to certain
adjustments.

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, any gain realized on the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note generally will not be subject to United
States federal income tax unless:

   - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent
establishment or fixed base), in which case you will be subject to United States federal income
tax on such gain in the same manner as described above with respect to effectively connected
interest; or

   - you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable
year of that disposition, and certain other conditions are met, in which case you will be subject
to United States federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable
income tax treaty) on such gain (net of certain United States source losses).

**_United States Federal Estate Tax_**

If you are an individual who is neither a citizen nor a resident (as specifically defined for United
States federal estate tax purposes) of the United States at the time of your death, your estate will not
be subject to United States federal estate tax on notes beneficially owned (or deemed to be beneficially
owned) by you at the time of your death, provided that any interest payment to you on the notes would
be eligible for exemption from United States federal withholding tax under the ‘‘portfolio interest rule,’’
described above under ‘‘—United States Federal Withholding Tax,’’ without regard to the statement
requirement described in the fifth bullet point of that section.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

**_U.S. Holders_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest on the
notes and the proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption)
of a note paid to you (unless you are an exempt recipient). Backup withholding may apply to such
payments if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number or a certification of exempt status,
or if you have failed to report in full interest and dividend income.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax
liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

367


-----

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Interest paid to you and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments
generally will be reported to the IRS. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest
payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which
you reside under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. In general, you will not be subject
to backup withholding with respect to payments of interest on the notes that we make to you provided
that the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a
United States person as defined under the Code, and such withholding agent has received from you the
required certification that you are a non-U.S. holder described above in the fifth bullet point under
‘‘Non-U.S. Holders—United States Federal Withholding Tax.’’

Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the
proceeds of a sale or other disposition of notes within the United States or conducted through certain
United States-related financial intermediaries, unless you certify to the payor under penalties of perjury
that you are a non-U.S. holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that
you are a United States person as defined under the Code), or you otherwise establish an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax
liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Additional Withholding Requirements**

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as ‘‘FATCA’’),
a 30% United States federal withholding tax may apply to any interest income paid on the notes to
(i) a ‘‘foreign financial institution’’ (as specifically defined in the Code) which does not provide
sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from
FATCA, or (y) its compliance (or deemed compliance) with FATCA (which may alternatively be in the
form of compliance with an intergovernmental agreement with the United States) in a manner which
avoids withholding, or (ii) a ‘‘non-financial foreign entity’’ (as specifically defined in the Code) which
does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an
exemption from FATCA, or (y) adequate information regarding certain substantial United States
beneficial owners of such entity (if any). If an interest payment is both subject to withholding under
FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under ‘‘Non-U.S. Holders—United States
Federal Withholding Tax,’’ the withholding under FATCA may be credited against, and therefore
reduce, such other withholding tax. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding these rules and
whether they may be relevant to your ownership and disposition of the notes.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of
the notes by (i) employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’), (ii) plans, individual retirement accounts and
other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any other federal,
state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of the Code or
ERISA (collectively, ‘‘Similar Laws’’), and (iii) entities which are deemed to hold the assets of any of
the foregoing types of plans, accounts or arrangements (each of the foregoing described in clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) being referred to herein as a ‘‘Plan’’).

**_General Fiduciary Matters_**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to
Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (a ‘‘Covered Plan’’) and prohibit certain transactions
involving the assets of a Covered Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and
the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of
such a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such a Covered Plan, or who
renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Covered Plan, is generally
considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan.

In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the
Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s
duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.
Furthermore, each Plan should consider that none of us, the initial purchasers, nor any of our or their
respective affiliates will act as a fiduciary and is not undertaking to provide investment advice, or to
give advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to any investment in the notes.

Government plans, non-U.S. plans and certain U.S. church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of such Plans
should consult with their counsel before acquiring notes or any interest in a note to determine the
suitability of the notes for such plan and the need for, and the availability of, if necessary, any
exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations.

**_Prohibited Transaction Issues_**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Covered Plans from engaging in
specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are ‘‘parties in interest,’’ within
the meaning of ERISA, or ‘‘disqualified persons,’’ within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code,
unless an exemption is available. The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any notes
should consider, among other things, whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or
indirect extension of credit between a Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale
or exchange of any property between a Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the
transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person, of any Plan assets.
Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the Issuer, the initial
purchasers or their affiliates.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may
be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition,
the fiduciary of the Covered Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be
subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

369


-----

The acquisition and/or holding of notes, including any interest in a note, by a Covered Plan with
respect to which the Issuer, a guarantor or an initial purchaser is considered a party in interest or a
disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held
in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this
regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or ‘‘PTCEs,’’
that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes (or interest therein). These class exemptions
include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified
professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts,
PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance
company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset
managers. In addition, the statutory exemption under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provides relief from certain prohibited transaction provisions of
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions between a Covered Plan
and a person who is a party in interest or a disqualified person solely as a result of providing services
to such Covered Plan or a relationship to such a service provider, provided that neither the person
transacting with the Covered Plan nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any
discretionary authority or control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any
Covered Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the Covered Plan receives no less,
nor pays no more, than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. These exemptions
do not, however, provide relief from the self-dealing prohibitions under ERISA and the Code. Each of
the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of
Covered Plans considering acquiring and/or holdings the notes (or interest therein) in reliance on these
or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption in consultation with counsel to assure it
is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any of the foregoing exemptions
or any other exemptions will be satisfied.

Because of the foregoing, the notes (including any interest in a note) may not be purchased or
held by any person investing assets of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute or
result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar
violation of any applicable Similar Laws, and none of us, the initial purchasers, nor any of our or their
respective affiliates is, or is undertaking to be, a fiduciary with respect to any Plan in connection with
the Plan’s purchase or holding of the notes.

**_Representation_**

Accordingly, by its acceptance of a note (including any interest in a note), each purchaser and
subsequent transferee of a note will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no
portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the notes (or any interest
therein) constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) (1) the acquisition and holding of the notes (or any
interest therein) by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation
under any applicable Similar Laws, and (2) each acknowledges and agrees that none of the Issuer, the
initial purchasers, nor any of our or their respective affiliates is, or is undertaking to be, a fiduciary
with respect to any Plan in connection with the Plan’s purchase or holding of the notes and, in the case
of a Covered Plan, that a fiduciary independent of the Issuer, the initial purchasers and their affiliates
acting on the Covered Plan’s behalf is and at all times will be responsible for its decision to invest in
and hold the notes as contemplated hereby.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive nor should it
be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be
imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that

370


-----

fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing or holding the notes (or any interest in a note) on
behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability
of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an
exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes. Neither this discussion nor
anything provided in this offering memorandum is, or is intended to be, investment advice directed at
any potential Plan purchasers, or at Plan purchasers generally, and such purchasers of any notes should
consult and rely on their own counsel and advisers as to whether an investment in notes is suitable for
the Plan. Purchasers have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the
notes do not violate the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code, or
any applicable Similar Laws. Except as otherwise stated herein, the sale of any notes to a Plan is in no
respect a representation by the Issuer, an initial purchaser, or any of their respective affiliates or
representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to such
investments by any such Plan generally or any particular Plan, or that such investment is prudent or
appropriate for such Plans generally or any particular Plan.

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to purchase the
notes are subject to various conditions. The initial purchasers propose to resell the respective notes at
the offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum to persons reasonably
believed to be QIBs (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States
in reliance on Regulation S. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ Certain of the initial purchasers may offer and
sell the notes through one or more of their respective affiliates or selling agents.

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may
not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as
defined in Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ The price at which the notes are
offered may be changed at any time without notice.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within
the United States by a dealer that is not participating in this offering may violate the registration
requirements of the Securities Act if that offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with
Rule 144A.

Each series of notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. We
do not intend to list the notes on any national securities exchange. However, we cannot assure you that
the prices at which the notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial
offering price or that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue after this
offering. The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the
notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue any market-making activities
with respect to the respective notes at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to
the liquidity of, or the trading market for, the notes.

372


-----

We have agreed to pay the initial purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection
with the offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open
market. Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short
positions and stabilizing purchases.

   - Short sales involve secondary market sales by the initial purchasers of a greater number of notes
than they are required to purchase in the offering.

   - Covering transactions involve purchases of notes in the open market after the distribution has
been completed in order to cover short positions.

   - Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not
exceed a specified maximum.

The initial purchasers also may impose a penalty bid. Penalty bids permit the initial purchasers to
reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the initial purchasers, in covering short
positions or making stabilizing purchases, repurchase notes originally sold by that syndicate member.

Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the
initial purchasers for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the
market price of the notes. They may also cause the price of the notes to be higher than the price that
would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers
may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the initial purchasers
commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

We expect to deliver the notes against payment for the notes on or about the date specified in the
last paragraph of the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the business
day following the date of the pricing of the notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as ‘‘T+ ’’).
Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally settle in two business
days, purchasers who wish to trade notes on the date of pricing prior to the delivery of the notes may
be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+, to specify alternative
settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.

The initial purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which
include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the initial
purchasers and their respective affiliates have in the past performed commercial banking, investment
banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they have received customary fees and
reimbursement of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform
services for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive customary fees and
reimbursement of expenses. Certain of the initial purchasers (or affiliates thereof) are acting as joint
lead arrangers, joint bookrunners, syndication agents, adjustment agents, co-managers or lenders for
our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In particular, an affiliate of (i) Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC is
acting as a joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner in respect of the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, a lender in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility and a joint lead dealer manager in
respect of the Tender Offers and (ii) Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC is acting as a joint lead
arranger, joint bookrunner, administrative agent and collateral agent in respect of the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, a lender in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility and a joint lead
dealer manager in respect of the Tender Offers. In addition, the initial purchasers (or affiliates thereof)
also have outstanding lending commitments to finance the Merger under a bridge facility. These
commitments will be reduced by the amount of the gross cash proceeds of this offering. Furthermore,
in the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities

373


-----

(or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit
default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold
long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investments and securities activities
may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates.

To the extent any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates are holders of indebtedness under our
Existing Credit Facilities, such initial purchasers or affiliates would receive a portion of the net
proceeds of this offering.

If the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of those
initial purchasers of their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers of their
affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management
policies. A typical such hedging strategy would include these initial purchasers or their affiliates
hedging such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit
default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered
hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of
the notes. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and
may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and
instruments.

We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to
make because of any of those liabilities.

**_Notice to Prospective Investors in Canada_**

The notes may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal
that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or
subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National
Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any
resale of the notes must be made in accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject
to, the prospectus requirements of applicable securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with
remedies for rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto)
contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the
purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or
territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the
purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 (or, in the case of securities issued or guaranteed by the government of a
non-Canadian jurisdiction, section 3A.4) of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts
(NI 33-105), the initial purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of
NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this offering.

**_Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom_**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area
(‘‘EEA’’) and the United Kingdom (‘‘UK’’). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of:

(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended,
‘‘MiFID II’’); or

374


-----

(ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the ‘‘Insurance Distribution
Directive’’), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the ‘‘Prospectus
Regulation’’).

Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended, the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA or the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the UK may be
unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes in any
Member State of the EEA or the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus
Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the notes. This offering
memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

This EEA and UK selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out in this
offering memorandum.

**_Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom_**

Each initial purchaser has represented and agreed that:

(a) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause
to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA)) received by it
in connection with the issue or sale of the notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of
the FSMA does not apply to us or the guarantors, and

(b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the notes in, from or otherwise involving the United
Kingdom.

**_Notice to Prospective Investors in Hong Kong_**

The notes have not been offered or sold and may not and will not be offered or sold in Hong
Kong, by means of any document, other than (i) to ‘‘professional investors’’ as defined in the Securities
and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder; or (ii) in other
circumstances which do not result in the document being a ‘‘prospectus’’ as defined in the Companies
(Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32, Laws of Hong Kong) and which do
not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of the Companies (Winding Up and
Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32, Laws of Hong Kong). No document, invitation or
advertisement relating to the notes has been issued, may be or will be issued or has been, may be or
will be in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue (in each case whether in Hong Kong or
elsewhere), which is directed at, or the contents of which are likely to be accessed or read by, the
public of Hong Kong (except if permitted under the securities laws of Hong Kong) other than with
respect to securities which are or are intended to be disposed of only to persons outside Hong Kong or
only to ‘‘professional investors’’ as defined in the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571, Laws of
Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder.

Warning: This offering memorandum has not been reviewed or approved by any regulatory
authorities, including the Securities and Future Commission of Hong Kong and the Companies Registry
of Hong Kong and neither has it been registered with the Registrar of Companies in Hong Kong.

part) in Hong Kong, and the notes may not be offered for subscription to members of the public in

Monetary Authority of Singapore. Accordingly, this offering memorandum and any other document or
material in connection with the offer or sale, or invitation for subscription or purchase, of the notes
may not be circulated or distributed, nor may the notes be offered or sold, or be made the subject of
an invitation for subscription or purchase, whether directly or indirectly, to persons in Singapore other
