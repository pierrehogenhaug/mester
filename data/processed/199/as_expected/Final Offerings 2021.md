-----

(3) if you are a resident in a Member State, you are a qualified investor (within the meaning of Article 2(e)

Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities offered under the
Offering Memorandum will be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act
pursuant to Rule 144A.

You are reminded that the Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a
person into whose possession the Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws
of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the Offering
Memorandum to any other person.

Under no circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an
offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or
sale would be unlawful.

The materials relating to the Offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or
solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the
Offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and any of the Initial Purchasers of the securities offered under
the Offering Memorandum or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that
jurisdiction, the Offering shall be deemed to be made by such Initial Purchaser or affiliate thereof on behalf of
the issuer in such jurisdiction.

The Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom and is
only being distributed to and is only directed at persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating
to investments and are investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Order”), (ii) are high net worth
companies, and other persons to whom it may lawfully be communicated, falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of
the Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to
engage in investment activity within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
(the “FSMA”) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or
caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). The Offering
Memorandum must not be acted upon by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment
activity to which the Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in
only with relevant persons. No part of the Offering Memorandum should be published, reproduced, distributed or
otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or
sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us.

References to Regulations or Directives include, in relation to the UK, those Regulations or Directives as
they form part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 or have been
implemented in UK domestic law, as appropriate.

The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and
consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls any Initial Purchaser, the Issuer, the
Guarantors (each as defined in the Offering Memorandum) or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents or affiliates, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference
between the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic form and any version that will be provided to
you at a later date upon your request from any Initial Purchaser.

**Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of each**
manufacturer’s approval process of the Notes, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described
in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible
counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended,
“MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to ECPs and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should
take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to the
Issuer’s obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking
its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) retail investors: The securities**
described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and


-----

should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution
Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended or superseded,
the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities in any Member
State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement
to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes
has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the
FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018
(“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the
FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance
Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**Prohibition Of Sales To UK Retail Investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise**
made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU)
2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified
investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part
of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the
UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be
made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes.
This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

**The Offering Memorandum is being distributed for information purposes only and is subject to**
**completion and amendment (which may be material) without notice. The definitive terms of the**
**transaction will be described in the final version of the Offering Memorandum. The Offering**
**Memorandum shall not, and is not intended to, constitute or contain any offer or invitation to sell or the**
**solicitation of any offer to buy and may not be used as, or in connection with, any offer or invitation to sell**
**or a solicitation of any offer to buy any of the securities described therein.**

**OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL** **IN THE UNITED STATES**

# PCF GmbH

**€750,000,000 Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Notes due 2026**
**(in a combination of fixed and floating rate notes)**

**€400,000,000 4** **[3]⁄4% Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Notes due 2026**

**€350,000,000 Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2026**

PCF GmbH, a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) organized under the laws of Germany (the “Issuer”), is hereby offering €400 million
in aggregate principal amount of its 4 [3]⁄4% Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the “Fixed Rate Notes”) and €350 million in aggregate principal amount
of its Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2026 (the “Floating Rate Notes” and, together with the Fixed Rate Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes will
be issued pursuant to an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated on or around April 22, 2021 (the “Issue Date”). The offering of the Notes is referred to herein as the
“Offering.”

The Fixed Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.750% per annum. The Fixed Rate Notes will mature on April 15, 2026. The Issuer will pay interest on the Fixed
Rate Notes semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on October 15, 2021. The interest rate on the Fixed Rate Notes will increase by
up to 0.2500% on the Step-up Date (as defined herein), unless the Issuer has notified the Trustee (as defined herein) in writing on or prior to the Certification Date (as
defined herein) that it has achieved certain sustainability performance targets, which are described in more detail in this offering memorandum. Prior to April 15, 2023, the
Issuer may redeem, at its option, all or a portion of the Fixed Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, plus the applicable “make-whole” premium, as described in this offering memorandum.
Prior to April 15, 2023, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes originally issued (including the aggregate principal
amount of any additional Fixed Rate Notes issued) in each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103.00% of the principal amount thereof. Prior to April 15, 2023,
the Issuer may redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the
redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum, provided that, inter alia, at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes remains
outstanding. At any time on or after April 15, 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Fixed Rate Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this offering
memorandum.

The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate equal to three-month EURIBOR (subject to a 0% floor) plus 4.750% per annum (the “FRN Margin”), reset
quarterly. The Floating Rate Notes will mature on April 15, 2026. The Issuer will pay interest on the Floating Rate Notes quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15,
July 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2021. The FRN Margin will increase by up to 0.2500% on the Step-up Date, unless the Issuer has notified
the Trustee in writing on or prior to the Certification Date that it has achieved certain sustainability performance targets, which are described in more detail in this offering
memorandum. Prior to April 15, 2022, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, all or a portion of the Floating Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, plus the applicable “make-whole” premium, as
described in this offering memorandum. At any time on or after April 15, 2022, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Floating Rate Notes at the redemption prices set
forth in this offering memorandum.

In addition, all, but not less than all, of the applicable series of Notes may also be redeemed upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the
occurrence of certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase all of the outstanding Notes at a purchase
price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. However, a change of control will not be deemed to
have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event.

The Notes will (i) be general senior obligations of the Issuer, (ii) rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the obligations of the Issuer under the New Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) and certain hedging
obligations, (iii) rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes (if any), (iv) be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness, and (v) be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the subsidiaries of the
Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes, including obligations to trade creditors.

On the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis (the “Notes Guarantees” and, each, a “Notes
Guarantee”) by the Guarantors (as defined herein). The Issuer and the Guarantors will also guarantee, on a senior secured basis, the New Revolving Credit Facility. The
Notes Guarantee of each Guarantor will (i) be a general senior obligation of such Guarantor, (ii) rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future
indebtedness of such Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes Guarantees, including obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and
certain hedging obligations, (iii) rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes Guarantees, (iv) be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do
not secure the Notes Guarantees, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness (if any), and (v) be structurally subordinated to any
existing or future obligations of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors.

On the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured by the Collateral (as defined herein). The Collateral
will also secure the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other future indebtedness permitted under the Indenture on a first-priority basis.
Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, liabilities in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other future
indebtedness permitted under the Indenture that are secured by the Collateral will be repaid with the proceeds from a distressed disposal of, or the enforcement of, the
Collateral in priority to the Notes. The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to
the limitations described in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The Collateral and the Notes Guarantees may
be released in certain circumstances.

The Notes will initially be issued in the form of global notes in registered form. The Notes will be in registered form in minimum denominations of €100,000 and
integral multiples of €1,000 above €100,000. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.” We expect the Notes to be delivered to investors in book-entry form through
Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”), on or about the Issue Date.

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing
of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed
on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained.

**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 34.**

**Issue Price of the Fixed Rate Notes: 100.000% plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date.**

**Issue Price of the Floating Rate Notes: 100.000% plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date.**

**The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the laws of any other**
**jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the**
**Securities Act. In the United States, the Offering is being made only to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) within the meaning of Rule 144A (“Rule 144A”) under the Securities Act in**
**compliance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act. You are hereby notified that the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) of the Notes may be relying on the exemption from certain**
**provisions of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A thereunder. Outside the United States, the Offering is being made in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation**
**S”) under the Securities Act. For additional information about eligible offerees and transfer restrictions, see “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions.**

requirements applicable in such jurisdiction.

We reserve the right to withdraw this offering at any time. We are making this offering subject to the terms
described in this offering memorandum and the purchase agreement relating to the Notes entered into between us
and the Initial Purchasers. We and the Initial Purchasers may reject any offer to purchase the Notes in whole or in

may acquire, for their own accounts, a portion of the Notes.

This offering memorandum contains summaries of various documents governing the Notes, believed to be
accurate, of some of the terms of specific documents, but reference is made to the actual documents for the
complete information contained in those documents. You should contact the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers with
any questions about this Offering. All summaries contained herein are qualified in their entirety by this reference.

The Initial Purchasers, the Trustee and the Security Agent make no representation or warranty, express or
implied, as to, and assume no responsibility for, the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in

Interests in the Notes will be available initially in book-entry form. We expect that the Notes sold will be
issued in the form of one or more global notes. The global notes will be deposited and registered in the name of a
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream. Transfers of interests in the global notes will be effected
through records maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream, respectively, and their respective participants. The

nor any non-U.S. securities authority or other authority has approved or disapproved of the Notes or determined
whether this offering memorandum is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal
offense in the United States.

In connection with the offering of the notes, the initial purchasers are acting exclusively for the Issuer and
no one else. Accordingly, in connection with the offering of the Notes, the initial purchasers will not be
responsible to anyone other than the Issuer for providing the protections (regulatory or otherwise) afforded to
their clients or for the giving of advice in relation to the offering of the Notes.

The Issuer, having made all reasonable enquiries, confirms that, to the best of its knowledge and belief

information contained in this offering memorandum.

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**European Economic Area**

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Notes will be made pursuant
to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the
Notes. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended or superseded),
and includes any relevant implementing measure in each member state (“EU Member State”) of the European
Economic Area (the “EEA”).

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do
so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such
offer. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do authorize, the making of any offer of Notes
through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final
placement of the Notes contemplated in this offering memorandum.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU
(as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the
“Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the
“PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in
the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any
retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

For the purposes of this section, the expression an “offer of notes to the public” in relation to any Notes in
any EU Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the
terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the
Notes, as the same may be varied in that EU Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus
Regulation in that EU Member State.

Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of each
manufacturer’s approval process of the Notes, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients
only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to ECPs and professional

iv


-----

clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to
our obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Germany**

The Offering is not a public offering in the Federal Republic of Germany. The Notes may not be offered and
sold in the Federal Republic of Germany except in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Prospectus
Act of the Federal Republic of Germany (Wertpapierprospektgesetz) (as amended, the “German Securities
Prospectus Act”), the Prospectus Regulation and any other laws applicable in Germany. No application will be
made under German law to permit a public offer of the Notes in the Federal Republic of Germany. This offering
memorandum has not been and will not be submitted to, nor has it been nor will it be approved by, the German
Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) (“BaFin”). BaFin has
not obtained and will not obtain a notification from another competent authority of a member state of the
European Union (each, a “Member State”), with which a securities prospectus may have been filed, pursuant to
Article 25 of the Prospectus Regulation. The Notes must not be distributed within Germany by way of a public
offer, public advertisement or in any similar manner, and this offering memorandum and any other document
relating to the Notes, as well as information contained therein, may not be supplied to the public in Germany or
used in connection with any offer for subscription of Notes to the public in Germany. Consequently, in Germany
the Notes will only be available to, and this offering memorandum and any other offering material in relation to
the Notes is directed only at, persons who are qualified investors (qualifizierte Anleger) within the meaning of
Section 2 No. 3 of the German Securities Prospectus Act in connection with Article 2 lit. e of the Prospectus
Regulation or who are subject of another exemption in accordance with Article 1 of the Prospectus Regulation.
Any resale of the Notes in Germany may only be made in accordance with the German Securities Prospectus Act,
the Prospectus Regulation and other applicable laws.

**Poland**

This offering memorandum is not a prospectus or information memorandum and, as such, has not been and
will not be approved by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego) (the
“KNF”) nor has any competent authority of another Relevant Member State notified, nor will any competent
authority of another Relevant Member State notify the KNF of its approval. Accordingly, this offering
memorandum may not be made available to the public, nor may the Notes otherwise be offered for sale in Poland
other than in circumstances that constitute an exemption from the requirement to prepare a prospectus or
information memorandum under the Prospectus Regulation and/or the Act on Public Offering, Conditions
Governing the Introduction of Financial Instruments to Organized Trading and Public Companies of July 29,
2005, as amended (the “Public Offering Act”).

regulatory authority in Canada in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes. No securities commission or
similar regulatory authority in Canada has reviewed or in any way passed upon this document or on the merits of
the Notes and any representation to the contrary is an offence. The Notes may be sold only to Canadian
purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are “accredited investors”, as such term is
defined in Section 1.1 of National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or, in Ontario, as such term is
defined in Section 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are “permitted clients”, as such term is defined in
section 1.1 of National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant
Obligations. Each Canadian purchaser who purchases the Notes will be deemed to have represented to the
Issuers, the Initial Purchasers and to each dealer from whom a purchase confirmation is received, as applicable,
that the purchaser (i) is purchasing as principal, or is deemed to be purchasing as principal in accordance with
applicable Canadian securities laws, for investment only and not with a view to resale or redistribution; (ii) is an
“accredited investor”; and (iii) is a “permitted client”. Any resale of Notes acquired by a Canadian purchaser in
the Offering (as defined below) must be made in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws, which
may vary depending on the relevant jurisdiction, and which may require resales to be made in accordance with
Canadian prospectus requirements, a statutory exemption from the prospectus requirements, in a transaction

v

exempt from the prospectus requirements or otherwise under a discretionary exemption from the prospectus
requirements granted by the applicable local Canadian securities regulatory authority. These resale restrictions
may under certain circumstances apply to resales of the Notes outside of Canada. Securities legislation in certain
provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for rescission or damages if this
offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation, provided that the
remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the
securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable
provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights, or
consult with a legal advisor. Canadian purchasers are advised that this document has been prepared in reliance on
Section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (“NI 33-105”). Pursuant to section 3A.3 of
NI 33-105, this document is exempt from the requirement that the Issuers and the Initial Purchasers in the
Offering provide Canadian purchasers with certain conflicts of interest disclosure pertaining to “connected
issuer” and/or “related issuer” relationships as would otherwise be required pursuant to subsection 2.1(1) of NI
33-105. Upon receipt of this offering memorandum, each Canadian purchaser hereby confirms that it has
expressly requested that all documents evidencing or relating in any way to the sale of the Notes described herein
(including for greater certainty any purchase confirmation or any notice) be drawn up in the English language
only. Par la réception de ce document, chaque investisseur Canadien confirme par les présentes qu’il a
_expressément exigé que tous les documents faisant foi ou se rapportant de quelque manière que ce soit à la vente_

being referred to as “relevant persons”). This offering memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must

made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes.
This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal)
Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or
regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify
as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK
PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the
UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any
retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum includes forward-looking statements, which are based on our assumptions,
opinions, estimates, projections and forecasts which involve known and unknown operational, business,
economic, regulatory and other risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results, performance
or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied
by such estimated financial information. These forward-looking have been made in good faith, based on
numerous assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the Issuer at the time of preparation, may or may not
prove to be correct or necessarily take place. In particular, all statements other than statements of historical facts
included in this offering memorandum including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial
position, risks and uncertainties related to our business, strategy, capital expenditures, projected costs and our
plans and objectives for future operations, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as
“believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “may,” “assume,” “plan,” “intend,” “will,” “should,” “estimate,” “risk” and
similar expressions or the negatives of these expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. By
their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate
to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking statements are
not guarantees of future performance. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

In addition, any forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this offering memorandum and
we do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set forth in this
offering memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements
attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this
offering memorandum. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the
industry in which we compete to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements contained in this offering memorandum. Factors that could cause such differences in actual results
include, in particular:

   - the cyclicality of our main end-markets and demand fluctuations for our products based on global or
regional economic or political conditions;

   - the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;

   - competition in our industry;

   - overcapacity in our markets;

potential further consolidation and internal growth among our customer base;

   - our inability to retain or replace our key suppliers;

   - the availability of, or any significant increase in the cost of, transportation;

   - uncertainties and variability in demand by customers;

   - our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our capital expenditure requirements;

European Union;

We disclose important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations
in “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations.” Other sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect_
our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a competitive and constantly
changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such
risk factors. We cannot assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements as a prediction of actual results.

**PRESENTATION OF INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

This offering memorandum contains statistics, data, estimates and other information relating to markets,
market sizes, market shares, market positions and other industry data pertaining to our business and end-markets.
Unless otherwise indicated, such information is based on our analysis of multiple sources, including industry
publications, surveys and industry reports prepared by consultants, internal surveys and customer feedback.
These third-party sources include a market study dated February 25, 2021 (the “Market Study”) that Pfleiderer
commissioned from a leading international third-party consultancy firm and certain other statistical and industry
information. The Market Study is based on primary interviews conducted with customers, industry experts and
other market participants, secondary market research and internal financial and operational information supplied
by, or on behalf of, Pfleiderer.

To the extent that information presented in this offering memorandum was taken from third-party sources,
such information has been accurately reproduced by us in this offering memorandum, and, as far as we are aware
and are able to ascertain from information published by relevant third parties, no material facts have been omitted
which would render the information provided inaccurate or misleading. Market studies, statistics, estimates and
analyses are, however, inherently predictive and subject to uncertainty and not necessarily reflective of actual
market conditions, are frequently based on information and assumptions that may not be accurate or technically
correct, and their methodology may be forward-looking and speculative. In particular, market studies, statistics,
estimates and analyses are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments
by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions
should be included in the relevant market. Industry publications or reports generally state that the information
they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy and completeness of such
information is not guaranteed. We have not independently verified the figures, market data and other information
used by third parties in the studies, publications and financial information reproduced herein, or the external
sources on which our estimates are based, including the Market Study. We therefore assume no liability for and
offer no guarantee of the accuracy of the data from studies and third party sources contained in this offering
memorandum or for the accuracy of third party data on which our estimates are based.

In addition, this offering memorandum includes estimates on the share of gross sales generated in the
DACH region by our Engineered Wood Products division that is represented by the renovation and replacement
segment and the new construction costumer segment. Such information is based on third-party industry sources
as well as our internal assessments, observations and estimates. We believe that our estimates of market and
industry data and the information we have derived from such data, as well as our estimates on the share of net
sales represented by the renovation and replacement segment and the new construction costumer segment help
investors to better understand the industry and markets in which we operate and our position within them. Our
own estimates have not been independently verified. While we assume that our own market and industry
observations are reliable, we give no warranty for the accuracy of our own estimates and the information derived
from them. They may differ from estimates made by our competitors or from other independent sources. While
we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented herein, such data involves
risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under “Risk
_Factors” in this offering memorandum._

The market projections and other forward-looking statements in this offering memorandum are not
guarantees of future performance. Actual events and circumstances could differ materially from current
expectations and numerous factors could cause or contribute to such differences. See “Risk Factors” and
“Forward-Looking Statements.”

**SUSTAINABILITY-LINKED FINANCING FRAMEWORK**

In connection with the Offering, we adopted a framework relating to our sustainability strategy and targets
to foster best market practices and present a unified and coherent suite of sustainability linked financing
instruments (the “Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework”) in accordance with the Sustainability-Linked
Bonds Principles (the “SLBP”) administered by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) and the
Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles (the “SLLP”) administered by the Loan Market Association (LMA). We
have developed the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework together with ISS Corporate Solutions. The
Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework was reviewed by ISS Corporate Solutions, which provided the
Second Party Opinion, and was published on our website at www.pfleiderer.com. The Second Party Opinion is
not incorporated into and does not form part of this offering memorandum. While we believe that the Second
Party Opinion is reasonable, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation about the suitability of
the Second Party Opinion or the Notes to fulfill any environmental and sustainability criteria. Investors should
conduct their own assessment of the Notes from a sustainability perspective. The contents of our website,
including any references made to information accessible therein, do not form part of, and are not incorporated by
reference into, this offering memorandum.

We will report annually on our performance with respect to the Sustainability Key Performance Indicators
for the preceding calendar year. This report will be separate from, and in addition to, the reporting required under
the Indenture.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**Historical Financial Information**

The financial information included in this offering memorandum has been extracted from the audited
consolidated financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020,
including the related notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS (the “Consolidated
Financial Statements”), and from internal and external accounting records of the Issuer or its subsidiaries, or has
been calculated on the basis of figures from the above-mentioned sources. The Consolidated Financial
Statements have been audited by Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft. See “Independent Auditors”
for a description of the report of our independent auditors on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are the first financial statements of the Issuer and accordingly the
adoption of IFRS has been undertaken in accordance with IFRS 1 and Pfleiderer’s transition date to IFRS was
January 1, 2018. On March 6, 2020, we completed the Silekol Transfer. See “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—The_
_Optimization of Our Corporate Structure—The Silekol Transfer.” Since the Silekol Transfer constituted a_
common control transaction, the Issuer has elected to apply carryover basis accounting rules. Consequently, for
all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements, all assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the
Issuer from the Silekol Transfer have been accounted for by using the historical book values of Silekol’s assets
and liabilities previously recognized by Pfleiderer Polska Sp Z.o.o, Silekol’s former direct parent entity as of
January 1, 2018, which is the start of the earliest reporting period presented in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. As a result, the Consolidated Financial Statements represent for all periods the corporate structure of
Pfleiderer as if the Silekol Transfer had been completed on January 1, 2018. In addition, the Issuer has adopted
IFRS 16 (Leases) as of January 1, 2018. Historically, the financial results of (i) the Issuer and its subsidiaries
(excluding Silekol), were presented as a separate reportable segment, the “Core West” segment, in the Parent’s
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and in the Parent’s accounting records
for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and (ii) Silekol division was (a) presented as a separate
reportable segment, the “Silekol” segment, in the Parent’s consolidated financial statements and accounting
records for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and (b) part of the “Core East” segment in the Parent’s
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. This offering memorandum only
includes the Consolidated Financial Statements and does not include the consolidated historical financial
statements or accounting records of the Parent. The Consolidated Financial Statements are not directly
comparable to the consolidated historical financial statements of the Parent for any period.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates and judgments in addition to those involved in preparing the Consolidated Financial
Statements. IFRS requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are
significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are disclosed in the notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this offering memorandum and in the section “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_

The financial information included in this offering memorandum was not prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). There could be significant
differences between IFRS, as applied by us, and U.S. GAAP. We neither describe the differences between IFRS
and U.S. GAAP nor reconcile our IFRS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, such information is not
available to investors, and investors should consider this in making their investment decision. The financial
information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with SEC reporting requirements.
Compliance with such requirements would require the modification, reformulation or exclusion of certain
financial measures. In addition, changes would be required in the presentation of certain other information.

**Unaudited As Adjusted Financial Information**

We also present in this offering memorandum certain unaudited historical financial information for the two
months ended February 28, 2020 and 2021, for the years ended December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2017, as
well as for the rolling twelve months ended March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019, September 30 2019, March 31, 2020,
June 30 2020 and September 30, 2020. In addition, in this offering memorandum we also present certain as
adjusted financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, including as adjusted senior
secured net debt, as adjusted total net debt and as adjusted cash interest expense, which has been prepared to
illustrate the effect of the Transactions on the Issuer’s debt position and cash interest expense as if the

xvii


-----

Transactions had occurred (i) on December 31 2020, in the case of as adjusted financial information derived from
information included on our statement of financial position, and (ii) on January 1, 2020, in the case of as adjusted
financial information derived from information included on our statement of profit or loss and statement of other
comprehensive income. See also “Summary—Summary Financial and Other Data.” The unaudited as adjusted
financial data presented herein does not purport to project our results as of any future date or for any future
period. The unaudited historical financial information, the adjustments to the Issuer’s unaudited as well as
audited historical financial information as well as the unaudited as adjusted financial data set forth in this
offering memorandum are based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe
are reasonable and may differ materially from the actual adjusted amounts. These as adjusted measures are not
financial measures defined in accordance with IFRS and, as such, may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies.

The unaudited as adjusted financial information included herein should be read in conjunction with
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Neither the unaudited historical financial information nor the adjustments to the historical financial
information nor the resulting as adjusted financial information has been audited or reviewed in accordance with
applicable auditing standards, and this financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act or the Prospectus Regulation. The unaudited as adjusted financial
information is not directly comparable to the historical consolidated financial information of Pfleiderer presented
in this offering memorandum.

**Our Divisions**

Our operations are organized into two divisions: Engineered Wood Products and Silekol. Through our
Engineered Wood Products division, we offer our customers an extensive range of high value-added, valueadded, basic and ancillary engineered wood- and wood products in a variety of finishes, functionalities and
designs. Through our Silekol division, we offer a broad range of specialty and industrial resins and other
chemicals to external customers, our Engineered Wood Products Division and Panel East. We present our two
divisions in the Consolidated Financial Statements for each of the reporting periods ended December 31, 2018,
2019 and 2020.

In this offering memorandum, references to total consolidated net sales are to total net sales generated from
our Engineered Wood Products division and our Silekol division, excluding inter-division sales but including
sales to Panel East. References to inter-division sales are to sales between the Engineered Wood Products and the
Silekol divisions. References to external net sales are to sales of products from the Engineered Wood Products
and Silekol divisions to external customers (not including Panel East), net of sales reductions (such as bonuses
for customers, cash discounts and refunds). References to sale of products (gross) are to sales of products from
the Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions to external customers (not including Panel East) excluding
the impact of sales reductions (such as bonuses for customers, cash discounts and refunds). References to sales to
Panel East are to sales from our Engineered Wood Products and Silekol division to Panel East.

**Non-IFRS Measures**

This offering memorandum contains certain non-IFRS measures and ratios, including Gross Profit
(excluding D&A, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin, capital expenditures, Adjusted EBITDA less
maintenance capital expenditure, Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure margin, Adjusted Free
Cash Flow and other measures and ratios that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS
(collectively, the “Non-IFRS Measures”). In addition, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum differ from the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” that
will be contained in the Indenture. Such Non-IFRS Measures are presented based on information derived from
the Consolidated Financial Statements, our historical accounting records and our internal accounting system.

We believe the Non-IFRS Measures provide supplemental information which may be useful in the review of
the Issuer’s financial performance described in this offering memorandum and are useful metrics for investors to
understand our results of operations and profitability because they permit investors to evaluate our profitability
from underlying operating activities. We also use these measures internally to establish forecasts, budgets and
operational goals to manage and monitor our business, as well as to evaluate our underlying historical
performance. For a description of how the Non-IFRS Measures are calculated from our consolidated results of

xviii


-----

operations and a reconciliation of the Non-IFRS Measures to our results of operations for the periods presented
in this offering memorandum, see “Summary—Summary Financial and Other Data.”

We believe the Non-IFRS Measures facilitate operating performance comparisons between periods and
among other companies in industries similar to ours because they remove the effect of variation in capital
structures, taxation, and non-cash depreciation, amortization and impairment charges, which may be unrelated to
operating performance. We believe the Non-IFRS Measures better reflect our underlying operating performance
because they exclude the impact of items which are not related to our core results of operations, including certain
one-off or non-recurring items. The Non-IFRS Measures or comparable measures are frequently used by
securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to us, many
of which present EBITDA-related performance measures when reporting their results.

The Non-IFRS Measures presented in this offering memorandum are based on assumptions, opinions,
estimates, projections and forecasts which involve known and unknown operational, business, economic,
regulatory and other risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results, performance or
achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied
by such Non-IFRS financial measures. These Non-IFRS measures have been prepared, in good faith, based on
numerous assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the Issuer at the time of preparation, may or may not
prove to be correct or necessarily take place.

In addition, the Non-IFRS Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them
in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any directly comparable financial measures prepared in
accordance with IFRS as set forth in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these limitations are:

   - not all of them reflect our cash expenditures and they do not reflect our future requirements for capital
expenditures on contractual commitments;

   - they may include cost savings which are based on various assumptions that we consider reasonable, but
these cost savings may not be achieved in the expected timeframe, or at all, as a result of future
unexpected changes in our business or other factors;

   - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced
in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;

   - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

   - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments on our debt;

   - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

   - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated
statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income;

   - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to
be indicative of our ongoing operations;

   - some of the non-recurring items that we eliminate in calculating certain EBITDA-based measures
reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made; and

   - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their
usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, the Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary
cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to
meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and
using the Non-IFRS Measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance. See “Summary—Summary
_Financial and Other Data,” “Selected Consolidated Financial Information,” “Management’s Discussion and_
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the_
notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Exchange Rate Information**

Although most of our net sales and costs base are denominated in euro, a portion of our net sales are
denominated in other currencies. The individual financial statements of each subsidiary of Pfleiderer are

xix


-----

presented in its functional currency. For the purposes of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the results and
financial position of Pfleiderer are expressed in euro, the presentational currency for Pfleiderer. For more
information on our currency exchange rate exposure, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Currency_
_Exchange Rate Exposure.”_

The results of operations and cash flows of subsidiaries which have non-euro functional currencies are
translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. The statement of financial position of each
subsidiary which has a non-euro functional currency is translated at year-end exchange rates, with the exception
of equity balances which are translated at historic rates. The resulting exchange differences are recognized in a
separate currency translation reserve within equity and are reported in other comprehensive income.

As of the end of the reporting period, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into the
functional currency at the exchange rate as of the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations
are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates as of the dates of the transactions. Foreign
currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income accumulated in reserve. At the time of
disposal of a foreign operation, any accumulated currency-translation differences are transferred to profit or loss
as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial data presented in
millions or in thousands, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this
offering memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. Percentages and
amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data set forth in “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are calculated using the numerical_
data in the Consolidated Financial Statements or the tabular presentation of other data (subject to rounding)
contained in this offering memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative
description thereof.

**EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION**

The following table presents, for the periods set forth below, the high, low, average and period end
Bloomberg Composite Rate (London) expressed as U.S. dollars per €1.00. The Bloomberg Composite Rate
(London) is a “best market” calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate
of all contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The
Bloomberg Composite Rate (London) is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask
rate. The rates presented herein may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of the Consolidated
Financial Statements and the operating and financial information appearing in this offering memorandum. None
of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers represent that the U.S. dollars amounts referred to below
could be or could have been converted into euro at any particular rate indicated or any other rate. The average
rate for a year means the average of the Bloomberg Composite Rates (London) on the last day of each month
during a year. The average rate for a month, or for any shorter period, means the average of the daily Bloomberg
Composite Rates (London) during that month, or shorter period, as the case may be. The Bloomberg Composite
Rate of the U.S. dollar on April 9, 2021 was $1.1900 per €1.00.

_Panel East. See also “—The Optimization of Our Corporate Structure.”_

**Overview**

With an operating history of over 125 years, Pfleiderer is a leading manufacturer of premium engineered
wood products and laminates for fast-growing, high-end applications in the Western European kitchen, furniture
and construction end-markets. Pfleiderer is also a leading producer of industrial and specialty resins for sales to
Central and Eastern European customers and for internal use in our panel production.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated €776.7 million in net sales and €152.0 million in Pro
_Forma Adjusted EBITDA (19.3% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin) as well as €71.0 million in Adjusted_
Free Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 2,200 people, serving a loyal and
diversified customer base of over 1,700 customers.

Our business comprises two divisions, Engineered Wood Products and Silekol, which represented 89% and
11%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales in 2020. With a market share of 14% by net sales in 2020, our
Engineered Wood Products division is the second largest manufacturer of premium engineered wood products
and laminates in the DACH region, which comprises Germany, Europe’s largest wood panel market, as well as
Austria and Switzerland. Our Silekol division is the third largest resin manufacturer by volume in Central and
Eastern Europe.

We primarily produce value-added and high value-added engineered wood products, which accounted for
78% of gross sales from our Engineered Wood Products division in the year ended December 31, 2020. We sell
our premium engineered wood products predominantly to customers in the fast-growing premium kitchen and the
robust and growing furniture end-markets, which together generated approximately 60% of our Engineered
Wood Products division’s gross sales in the year ended December 31, 2020. In the year ended
December 31, 2020, 91% of the external gross sales of our Engineered Wood Products division were to
customers located in Western Europe, which has allowed us to benefit from stable and growing market
environments. We estimate that in the same year we generated approximately 75% of gross sales in our
Engineered Wood Products division from the renovation and replacement segment. The renovation and
replacement segment has historically been resilient to cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions and has
contributed to our stable revenue generation and gross margins.

(6) Rest of World (“RoW”) comprises the remaining jurisdictions in which our customers are located.

Our leading market position and strong focus on attractive end-markets is supported by our efficient and
well-invested production facilities. Our Engineered Wood Products division operates five highly automated
manufacturing plants, which are strategically located across Germany in close proximity to our customers in our
key market, the DACH region. We believe that the close proximity of our plants to key customers in Germany
provides us with an important competitive advantage due to the limited ability to profitably transport engineered
wood products over long distances. Silekol’s resin production plant is located in Poland, which provides costefficient access to both Western and Central and Eastern European markets.

Our operations have historically generated industry-leading margins and free cash flow conversion and
benefit from a lean and flexible cost structure. The success of our business is underpinned by, among others, a
high share of higher-margin value- and high-value added products, economies of scale, a high degree of
automation, backward integration within both chemicals and electricity, as well as our as high share of recycled
wood usage, which helps reduce our raw material procurement costs.

We continuously strive to operate our business with a view to sustainability and protecting the environment,
which is well-aligned with our focus on high product quality, superior customer service, and staying at the
forefront of product innovation. In connection with the Offering, we adopted the Sustainability-Linked Financing
Framework, pursuant to which we have committed to increasing the Percentage of Recycled Wood Used in our
operations to at least 44% by the end of 2022 and 50% by the end of 2025, in each case from approximately 40%
in 2020. We have also committed to reduce our Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions to 201.7 kT by the end
of 2022 and to 173.9 kT by the end of 2025, in each case from 220.2 kT in 2020. Adopting the SustainabilityLinked Financing Framework will allow us to leverage our existing sustainability expertise to meet ambitious
timelines and targets to further improve our sustainability performance in a way that is relevant, core and
material to our business.

Historically, our Parent operated our business through three divisions: Engineered Wood Products, Silekol
and Panel East. Following the take-private of our Parent by SVPGlobal in September 2019, we have optimized
our corporate structure to focus on our core divisions, Engineered Wood Products and Silekol, which we are now
operating together through the Issuer. Panel East is being managed independently by our Parent. We believe that
these changes in our corporate structure have enabled us to focus on the core strengths of the Engineered Wood
Products and Silekol divisions and position us well for the next phase of our growth. In 2019 and 2020, our

management team also implemented a comprehensive series of cost savings and efficiency initiatives. These
initiatives, together with the optimization of our corporate structure, have allowed us to benefit from more
efficient operations, a highly flexible cost base and a stronger competitive profile in our premium end-markets.
All of this has strongly enhanced our credit profile as demonstrated by our resilient performance during the
recent COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Our Engineered Wood Products division is a leading wood panel and laminate producer in Western Europe.
Through this division, we focus on producing a broad range of value-added and high-value added engineered
wood products. We sell these products under the Pfleiderer, Duropal and Thermopal brands. We serve customers
primarily in the kitchen, furniture and construction end-markets. We focus primarily on the residential sector,
with a focus on the renovation and replacement segment, including shops, hotels, hospitals, nursing homes and
restaurants. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our Engineered Wood Products division generated net sales
of €687.9 million (including inter-division sales to our Silekol division). In the same year, our Engineered Wood
Products division generated Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €133.3 million, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
margin of 19.0% and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure margin of 14.6%.

Our Silekol division manufactures a full spectrum of resins, with a focus on specialty resins, which have
higher margins compared to industrial resins. In 2020, we sold our resins to over 200 external customers,
primarily in the German and Polish wood-based panel production, packaging, construction and building materials
industries. We also sell our resins to Panel East on an arm’s length basis. In addition, our Silekol division
operates as a vertically integrated in-house resins manufacturer and supplies resins to our Engineered Wood
Products division for use in manufacturing our engineered wood products, including on an exclusive basis for
certain products. We believe this gives us a competitive advantage in supply sourcing. For the year ended
December 31, 2020, our Silekol division generated net sales of €121.1 million (including inter-division sales to
our Engineered Wood Products division). In the same year, our Silekol division generated Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA of €18.7 million, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4% and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
_less capital expenditure margin of 14.4%._

**Our Strengths**

**_Well-positioned in attractive Western European markets with exposure to structurally growing and resilient_**
**_end-markets with high barriers to entry_**

Following the optimization of our corporate structure in 2020, we are well-positioned as a leading supplier
of premium engineered wood products and laminates in attractive and growing end-markets in Western Europe.
This enables us to focus on achieving growth in our core business and benefit from more efficient operations. We
demonstrated this in 2020 when we meaningfully increased our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
margins despite the COVID-19 pandemic. We have grown our Adjusted EBITDA in every year since 2012, and
have achieved a 9.8% compound annualized growth rate during this period.

_Our core geographical markets have a strong and sustainable growth outlook driven by exposure to attractive_
_and resilient end-markets_

We primarily sell our premium engineered wood products and laminates into the DACH region, the United
Kingdom and France, which are our key addressable markets. According to third party reports, including a report
prepared for us by a leading international consulting firm, these markets had a total size of €4.6 billion in 2020,
of which the DACH region accounts for €2.9 billion. These markets are expected to grow at a CAGR of 4% to
5% to reach approximately €5.7 billion in 2025. This growth is expected to be driven primarily by strong growth
in the DACH region, supported by the fast-growing export markets in the United Kingdom and France. In the
year ended December 31, 2020, the DACH region, United Kingdom and France together accounted for
€486.3 million, or 75%, of our Engineered Wood Products division’s gross sales.

Growth in our core addressable markets in Western Europe is primarily driven by the exposure to the
kitchen, furniture, construction (residential and non-residential) and specialized application industries, which
represented 33%, 27%, 37% and 2%, respectively, of gross sales generated by our Engineered Wood Products
division in the year ended December 31, 2020. Growth in the resilient kitchen and furniture end-markets is
primarily driven by robust Western European demand, an increasing shift towards higher-value premium
products, as well as an increase in export of high-end kitchens produced in Germany. Growth in the welldiversified construction industry is primarily driven by robust domestic German demand as well as increased
usage of sustainable materials, including wood.

_Our primary exposure is to the renovation and replacement segment, which is more resilient to macroeconomic_
_fluctuations_

Our business further benefits from the significant exposure to the renovation and replacement segment. This
segment has historically been more resilient and less volatile than new construction activity in periods of
economic recession and reduced investments. We estimate that in 2020 the renovation and replacement segment
accounted for over 75% of gross sales from our Engineered Wood Products division compared to 70% in the
2019. We estimate that in 2020 the new construction segment accounted for approximately 22% of gross sales
from our Engineered Wood Products division, compared to approximately 30% in 2019. As a result, we have
benefitted from stable, through-the-cycle revenue generation and gross margins. We also see a secular trend of
energy saving and sustainability enhancing renovations which further drives growth in the renovation and
replacement segment.

The following graphs illustrate the breakdown by segment of gross sales generated in our Engineered Wood
Products division from the sale of products to external customers in the year ended December 31, 2020, based on
management estimates.

(1) Based on management estimates derived from the analysis of the segment exposure as prepared by a leading consulting firm for the gross
sales (excluding the impact of sales reductions, such as bonuses for customers, cash discounts and refunds) generated in the DACH
region by our Engineered Wood Products divisions from the sale of products to external customers excluding (i) inter-division sales from
our Engineered Wood Products division to our Silekol division and (ii) sales to Panel East.

_Our Western European markets are stable growing and benefit from structural growth that is underpinned by_
_long term trends._

We believe there are three structural drivers that have driven growth in our end-markets in recent years.
These are home improvement, premiumization (i.e., the integration of the kitchen into the living space) and the
trend towards more sustainable, environment friendly buildings. These trends have been visible for years and
have been further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect that once COVID-19-related restrictions
are lifted, these trends will be reinforced and continue to drive growth in our end-markets in the coming years. In
particular, we believe that employers will continue to adopt, and employees will continue to support, flexible
work models, leading to an increase in remote working. We believe premiumization to continue as a trend and
believe we are well positioned given our focus on innovative, high value added products. We expect this will
mainly benefit the kitchen and furniture end-markets.

In addition, government subsidy programs for the use of sustainable materials in buildings have increased,
and are expected to continue to increase, demand for wood and wood-based products. Steady increase of usage of
wood as environmentally friendly and renewable material accelerated by heightened focus on sustainability is a
long term trend that is here to stay. We expect this will primarily benefit the construction end-markets. This is
further reinforced by recent trends, where we estimate that the share of wooden houses out of total pre-fabricated
houses in Germany increased from approximately 13.5% in 2000 to approximately 15% in 2010 and
approximately 20% in 2020, and is expected to reach approximately 25% in 2025. Similarly, we estimate that the
share of energy efficient renovations out of total renovations in Germany increased from approximately 9% in
2015 to approximately 10% in 2020, and is expected to reach approximately 15% in 2025.

_Favorable industry dynamics in our core markets_

We estimate that in 2020 the top three and five manufacturers in the DACH region, including us, had a
combined market share of approximately 50% and 70%, respectively. We believe that the structural reduction in


5


-----

engineered wood production capacity over the last ten years has contributed to a healthy and disciplined market.
In particular, we estimate that total engineered wood production capacity in Western Europe has been reduced
significantly since 2005. This was primarily due to the financial crisis in the late 2000s, which rendered some
production facilities uneconomical. Given such reduced capacity, utilization rates among engineered wood
manufacturing facilities in the DACH region have been stable since 2012 at well over 90% compared to
approximately 80% in 2009. Furthermore, market participants have increasingly focused on premium products,
which, in combination with the disciplined capacity development, have led to higher EBITDA margins among
the top tier producers in our markets.

We benefit from several industry dynamics which limit the ability of new competitors to enter our core
DACH market. Building new engineered wood manufacturing plants in Western Europe and installing
state-of-the-art equipment for value-added and highly-automated basic products requires significant initial capital
investments. For example, we estimate that the construction of a new particleboard manufacturing plant in the
DACH region would require an investment of approximately €300 million to €500 million, given the high
minimum scale and level of automation required to compete effectively. Furthermore, high regulatory and
environmental permit costs and requirements, including lengthy lead times for certain regulatory approvals,
significantly reduce the likelihood of meaningful capacity additions in the DACH region. According to a report
prepared for us by a leading international consulting firm, capacity additions in both RCB and MFB are unlikely
to exceed projected demand growth, which suggests stable utilization rates.

Our recurring customer survey feedback has demonstrated that customers value the long-standing
relationships, reliable supply and consistent quality among products and geographies, which are difficult to
replicate for new market entrants. Our customers associate the Pfleiderer brands with high product quality,
excellent customer service and reliability. In particular, in 2020, our Engineered Wood Products division
achieved a “net promoter score” of 29% in an NPS survey prepared for us by a leading international consulting
firm, which demonstrates the strength of the Pfleiderer’s brand and customers’ satisfaction with our delivery. We
are among the few large scale suppliers capable of servicing the industry’s leading customers and pride ourselves
on being able to address their needs across leveraging our basic, value-added and high value-added products. Our
combination of scale and focus on industry-leading value-added and high-value added products provides us with
a strong relative cost position, while at the same time providing value through our strong portfolio of premium
products.

Due to the limited ability to profitably transport engineered wood products and key raw materials, such as
resins, over long distances, production facilities need to be located in close proximity to customers to compete in
a cost-effective manner. As a result, competition in our markets from lower-production cost geographies, such as
Eastern Europe, is limited. The production of engineered wood products requires market expertise and
established relationships with raw material suppliers, as the availability of raw materials, particularly wood and
high quality sawdust for thin surfaces, is limited and regionally fragmented, which increases sourcing
complexity. The ability of manufacturers to hedge raw material risk through the the mix of wood and wood
substitutes used is limited.

**_We are a leading producer of premium products with a loyal, diversified customer base_**

Through our Engineered Wood Products division, we focus on providing a broad range of value-added and
high value-added products generating high and resilient contribution margins to a large, diversified and loyal
customer base.

_Strong focus on value-added and high value-added products generating high and resilient contribution margins_

We are a leading producer of high-quality premium engineered wood-based products focused on providing
our customers with value-added and high value-added products. These premium products require increased levels
of customization compared to basic products and therefore generate higher and more resilient margins. In the
year ended December 31, 2020, our value-added and high value-added products accounted for 23% and 55%,
respectively, of our Engineered Wood Products division’s gross sales. We are currently one of only two scale
manufacturers of engineered wood products and laminates in the DACH region (Egger being the other) focused
on value-added and high-value added products instead of the volume-driven market basic products, which
companies such as Kronospan, Sonoe Arauco and Swiss Krono produce.

We typically work closely with our customers, particularly in the kitchen, furniture and construction
end-markets, to provide products that meet their requirements for specific applications, such as consistent color
and haptic qualities, durability, thickness, scratch resistance, waterproofing or fire-resistance. As a result, our
value-added products are more difficult to substitute than basic products, and price and demand for our valueadded products have historically been higher and more stable.

Furthermore, our high share of value-added and high value-added products gives us high and relatively
stable contribution margins. While we consider the average contribution margin for our basic products as very
attractive, our value-added and high-value added products have contribution margins which are on average
around five and more than ten percentage points, respectively, higher than the contribution margin of our basic
products. Our value-added and high value-added products also drive customer retention and are subject to less
pricing pressure than basic products. This is due to the limited number of value-added product manufacturers in
our markets and because customers of value-added products tend to value product customization, quality, design,
customer service levels and just-in-time delivery over price. In addition, our products generally represent a small
portion of their total costs incurred in manufacturing their finished products. According to management data and
third party reports, basic products typically make up approximately 30-40% of our individual end-customer’s
total cost base, while value-added products typically make up approximately 10-20% and high value-added
products typically make up less than 10%. To maintain our competitive position, we continuously develop new
value-added products, which we often develop in close cooperation with our customers to meet their required
specifications.

_Diversified and loyal customer base with low customer concentration and long standing relationships_

In our Engineered Wood Products division, we sell engineered wood products and laminates to a diversified
and loyal customer base comprising more than 1,500 active customers as of December 31, 2020. Our
end-markets are primarily the kitchen and furniture industries and, to a lesser degree, the construction industry.
We sell to wholesalers, retailers and other distributors, who in turn sell to smaller manufacturers and carpenters.
Our customers value us for our high quality products, consistent on-time delivery performance and wide range of
décors and textures that help differentiate their end products. For example, according to our NPS surveys, which
measures the propensity for our customers to recommend our products, our Engineered Wood Products division
achieved a “net promoter score” of 29% in 2020. This compares to an average of negative 3% for our key
competitors in the same year. We believe that our consistently high levels of customer satisfaction are driven by
our strong track record of launching new and innovative products, our ability to supply them continuously with


7


-----

matching components for repair and replacement over the useful life of their products. In addition, there is a
limited number of competitors that can offer a breadth and scope of products similar to ours.

Our business also benefits from the longevity of our customer relationships and a significant number of our
customers have purchased from us for more than thirty years. In particular, all of our top ten customers in our
Engineered Wood Products division have been our customers for ten or more years, with our relationships with
each of our top four customers spanning more than 20 years. In turn, long-standing customer relationships
improve product planning, financial forecasting and stability. We also benefit from low customer concentration.
The top ten and top 50 external customers of our Engineered Wood Products division represented 18% and 41%
of the division’s external net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. No single external
customer represented more than 5% of our Engineered Wood Products division’s external net sales in the same
period.

**_We have a long-standing and market leading focus on ESG trends with a sustainable manufacturing_**
**_approach_**

Wood, an inherently sustainable resource, has been at the core of our focus for more than 125 years. The
renewable nature of wood, our single most important raw material, has historically played a major role in shaping
our corporate culture. Over the last several decades, we have established a strong focus on ESG and sustainability
trends in our key end-markets. This is supported by our sustainable manufacturing process focused on protecting
the environment, while not compromising the high quality of our products. In 1987, we introduced to the market
our LivingBoard panels, which are made with formaldehyde-free glue and have been are certified as a “green”
building product. In addition, we started using recycled wood at our plants in 1993. In 1997, we also established
our first CHP (combined heat power plant) plant to produce electricity from carbon-neutral biomass.

We focus on the sustainable sourcing of wood and constantly endeavor to increase the share of recycled
wood used in our products. By increasing the amount of recycled wood used in our products, we are able to
decrease our use of fresh wood and lower our overall raw material costs and increase our margins. At the same
time, utilizing recycled wood in our manufacturing processes allows us to meet the increasing demand for
sustainable products in our end-markets. This is coupled with the growing willingness by our end-customers to
pay higher prices for environmentally friendly products.

We are among the first in the industry to use closed-loop recycling of wood waste and cascading utilization
of wood, which consists of the efficient utilization of wood as a resource through multiple processing stages,
from harvesting to recycling and energy recovery. We believe that the cascading utilization of wood is the only
wood utilization model that can guarantee sustainable production of high quality, innovative wood products,
while relieving the burden on forestry and reducing our overall environmental footprint. We will continue to
strengthen partnerships with external stakeholders, including innovative and certified recycling companies,
furniture manufacturers, suppliers and customers to promote the cascading utilization of wood and closed-loop
recycling to increase the supply of recycled wood in our production process.

We have made dedicated and meaningful capital investments in order to increase the share of recycled wood
used in our products. We estimate that in the year ended December 31, 2020, recycled wood represented
approximately 40% of total wood used in 2020, compared to approximately 38% in 2018. Pursuant to the
Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework that we adopted in connection with the Offering, we have
committed to increase the Percentage of Recycled Wood Used to at least 44% by the end of 2022 and 50% by the
end of 2025, in each case from our 2020 baseline. Based on management data and a report prepared for us by a
leading international consulting firm, the share of recycled wood we use in our products is significantly higher
than those of one of our key competitors, one of the few to make such information public, which was
approximately 21% in 2020. In addition, we estimate that in the year ended December 31, 2020, industrial wood,
which is used as pre-consumer recycling material, represented approximately 45% of total wood used, increasing
the share of overall recycled materials used in our products to approximately 84%.

All of the fresh wood we process at our plants is sourced from sustainably managed forests that are largely
certified by well-recognized industry organizations such as FSC[®] and PEFC, which ensure that wood is sourced
in a sustainable way and that biodiversity as well as existing fauna and flora is safeguarded. We estimate that in
the the year ended December 31, 2020, fresh, sustainably sourced wood represented approximately 14% of total
wood used. Our strong commitment to sustainability and environmental protection is also testified by the


8


-----

recognition of an increasing number of our engineered wood products as Cradle to Cradle Certified[™], a globally
accepted measure of safer, more sustainable products made for the circular economy.

In order to protect the environment, meet sustainability needs and contribute to the mitigation of the effects
of climate change, we also focus on minimizing environmental pollution and, in particular, on reducing our
Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions. We estimate that in 2020 we generated approximately 220.2 kT of
Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions compared to approximately 238.5 kT and approximately 270.6 kT in
2019 and 2018, respectively. Overall, we estimate that we reduced Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions by
approximately 26% from 2013 to 2020. Pursuant to the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework that we
adopted in connection with the Offering, we have committed to reduce our Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas
Emissions to 201.7 kT by the end of 2022 and to 173.9 kT by the end of 2025, in each case from 220.2 kT in
2020. We also estimate that approximately 95% of the electricity we used in 2020 came from carbon-neutral
biomass produced at our CHP plants.

In addition to benefitting the environment, our meaningful investment in our recycled wood capacity also
meaningfully enhances our relative cost position as recycled wood is cheaper to source than fresh wood.
Furthermore, our commitment to reducing our Scope 1 & Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions, which we have
focused on since the introduction of our emission-free LivingBoard in 1987, meaningfully enhances the
attractiveness of our products to our sustainability-conscious end customers.

**_We have a solid and resilient financial profile supported by high Adjusted EBITDA margins and strong free_**
**_cash flow generation_**

_Resilient, through-the-cycle financial performance_

During the past ten years, we have transformed our company into a stable and resilient business with a
strong focus on premium products and a highly variable cost base. As a result, our Adjusted EBITDA grew at a
CAGR of 9.8% between 2012 and 2020 and our Adjusted EBITDA margins increased from 10.1% in 2012 to
16.9% in 2020, and in the year ended December 31, 2020, our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.3%.
Adjusted EBITDA has grown every year since 2012 in spite of varied macroeconomic environments, including
but not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In addition, the order book in our Engineered Wood
Products division increased from a monthly average of approximately €69 million in the the year ended
December 31, 2020 to approximately €120 million in January 2021, approximately €131 million in February
2021 and approximately €137 million in March 2021, which we believe provides us with good visibility on our
sales performance in the second quarter of 2021. The following graph provides an overview of the development
of our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from 2012 to 2020:

(1) Adjusted EBITDA gives effect to IFRS 16 from January 1, 2018, which was the date of the Issuer’s transition to IFRS. Adjusted
EBITDA for the periods from 2018 to 2020 is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 is a pro
forma amount, which includes an estimated adjustment to give effect to the impact of IFRS 16 had we adopted it during this period,
based on the impact of IFRS 16 on our Adjusted EBITDA for 2018. Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 has been derived from the combined
financial statements for the Issuer and may not be presented on the same basis as Adjusted EBITDA for the periods after December 31,
2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the periods from 2012 to 2016 is based on the business unit reporting in our unaudited management
accounts, which do not give effect to the optimization of our corporate structure in 2020 and are not directly comparable to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2) Refers to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA with Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures
based on Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma adjusted net sales, which includes an estimated net sales contribution of
€11.6 million from our pricing initiatives.

(3) Based on Adjusted EBITDA of approximately €76 million generated in the second half of 2020.

We believe that the pricing of premium products has historically been less impacted by the underlying raw
materials price developments as compared to basic products and we have been able to maintain high price levels
even when raw material prices decreased. In addition, our focus on value-added and high value-added products
has historically allowed us to actively pass through raw material price increases to our customers due to
relatively stable customer demand for these products and low price elasticity. In the year ended December 31,
2020, we achieved a net pass-through of approximately €13.4 million. At the same time, we were able to increase
the contribution margin of our high value-added products by approximately four percentage points from 2018 to
2020.

Over the past ten years, we have also implemented a number of initiatives to make our operations more
stable and resilient and increase the share of variable costs in our cost structure. Between 2017 and 2020, we
have made significant capital expenditures to modernize our facilities and increase automation, digitalization and
efficiency. We have also rationalized our fixed cost structure by reducing our full-time employees from 2,338 as
of December 31, 2016 to 2,227 as of December 31, 2020. Starting in the year ended December 31, 2019, we
implemented a number of cost saving and efficiency initiatives aimed at streamlining our cost base by optimizing
our headcount, obtain logistics, administrative and indirect procurement cost savings, and achieve raw material
efficiencies. These cost initiatives resulted in savings of €20.5 million reflected in our results for the year ended
December 31, 2020. In addition to our cost saving initiatives, in 2020 we began implementing certain price
improvement initiatives aimed at further improving our product margins. As a result of our cost saving
initiatives, we decreased our fixed costs to 13% of our total cost base in the year ended December 31, 2020.

We believe that our focus on making our business more resilient and sustainable has allowed us to soften the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is reflected in our performance in 2020. This has also allowed us to
benefit from the strong economic recovery starting in the third quarter of 2020. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA of
our Engineered Wood Products division increased by 3% and 26%, respectively, in the third and fourth quarters
of 2020 compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2019. This performance highlighted the success of our
strategy of focusing on the value-added segment in the resilient kitchen and furniture end markets. Overall, in the
year ended December 2020, our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by over 7% and 2%,
respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Industry-leading Adjusted EBITDA margins and strong Adjusted Free Cash Flow generation_

We benefit from industry-leading Adjusted EBITDA margins and strong cash flow generation relative to
our peers. We achieve this through our higher margin products in our product portfolio, our strong relative cost
position which is the result of our scale and high levels of automation, our strong pricing discipline, supported by
efficient raw material sourcing (including the use of recycled wood) and active management of raw material cost
pass-through. We have also successfully implemented several structural cost saving initiatives during both years
ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 (described elsewhere in this offering memorandum).

Between 2018 and 2020, our Adjusted Free Cash Flow increased from €18.6 in the year ended
December 31, 2018 to €71.0 in the year ended December 31, 2020. In the same year, our Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure margin was 80%. In 2020, based on public-available information,
we have among the highest Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures
margins within the industry, including among our direct competitors and a broader selection of listed building

**_Highly experienced management team with a strong track record_**

Our business benefits from the industry expertise and know-how of our experienced senior management
team, which has long-standing experience in building materials manufacturing and distribution, and a strong
track record of financial and operational success in both favorable and challenging market conditions. Our senior
management includes Miguel Kohlmann, who is the Chairperson of the Parent’s Advisory board since September
2020, having previously served as an advisor to the board since May 2018, and has more than 30 years of
experience in management positions; Dr. Frank Herrmann, who has been our Chief Operating Officer since May
2019 and has more than ten years of experience in operational management roles; and Stefan Zinn, who has been
our Chief Commercial Officer since January 2019 and has more than 25 years of experience in sales positions. In
addition, in connection with the completion of the Restructuring and in preparation for a renewed phase of
growth, in January 2021, we welcomed our new Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Mani Herold, who has over 20 years
of experience in finance positions at global companies, including more than nine years as CFO, and in February
2021, we welcomed our new Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson in respect of our Engineered Wood
Products division, Dr. Boris Gorella, who has over 30 years of experience in leadership positions, including more
than ten years as CEO, with industrial coatings, chemical and consulting companies. Since February 2021, our
former CEO, Zbigniew Prokopowicz, is a member of the Advisory board of the Parent and is responsible for the
Silekol division and Panel East, providing us with continued expertise, particularly from the leadership roles he
has held in our business since 2016.

**Our Strategies**

**_Continue to focus on value-added and high value-added premium products_**

We will continue to focus on product innovation and research and development to increase the share of our
value-added and high-value add engineered wood products in our portfolio. We will focus on expanding the


11


-----

characteristics of the finishes of our HPL products, such as HPL products with special coating for outdoor use.
We believe such products are less price elastic and will further help us penetrate the outdoor furniture market.
We plan to increase our output of value-added and high-value added products by selectively reducing our
end-market sale of of basic raw particleboards, and plan to use this particleboard capacity to produce higher
value laminated and coated products (such as MFB and coated HPL).

We sell our products to a variety of niche markets, such as hospitals, hotels, elevator interiors, playground,
garden furniture and caravan and mobile home interiors. We will continue to focus on identifying additional
attractive niche markets for value-added and high-value add products in order to increase customer
diversification. As transportation cost is less relevant for high-value add products, we also plan to expand our
exporting activities of such products to other regions, including China and Taiwan.

Lastly, we will continue to actively manage the pricing of our premium products by analyzing our markets,
enhancing the distinguishing features of our products, achieving greater pass-through of raw material costs to our
customers. We will also continue to actively monitor our portfolio of basic products with a view to shifting into
HPL products. We believe this strategy will result in a continued augmentation in the average price and
contribution margin of our product portfolio.

**_Continue to increase our focus on ESG trends and sustainable manufacturing_**

We will continue to focus on the sustainable sourcing of wood and on making our manufacturing processes
and product portfolio more sustainable. This is part of our ongoing environmental and sustainability strategy and
supports key trends in the kitchen, furniture and construction industries. We believe we can establish a leading
market position in products that have been certified as sustainable, such as “Blue Angel” certified products,
which have been certified by the German government as environmentally friendly. For example, in 1987, we
were among the first wood panel manufacturers to introduce engineered wood panels made with formaldehydefree glue, our LivingBoard panels, which obtained the prestigious “Blue Angel” certification. We are also the
first panel manufacturer that has obtained the renowned “Cradle to Cradle” certification on several products. In
the construction markets, there is a growing demand for environmentally sustainable products, such as woodbased products for pre-fabricated houses. We believe we will be able to meet this demand through our
specialized product lines.

Pursuant to the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework that we adopted in connection with the
Offering, we have committed to increase the share of the recycled wood used in our products from 40% in the
year ended December 31, 2020, to at least 44% by the end of 2022 and at least 50% by the end of 2025. In order
to do this, we will continue focus on closed-loop recycling of wood waste and cascading utilization of wood. In
addition, starting from 2021 we plan to invest further in debottlenecking actions to unlock our capacity to
produce higher quantities of recycled wood at our Neumarkt and Leutkirch facilities. We believe that the use of
recycled wood not only drives sustainability, but also reduces our costs. These materials tend to be cheaper and
have lower energy costs than non-sustainable products since they use a lower amount of water, requiring less
drying.

Additionally, we are aiming to increase the number of environmentally-friendly adhesives in our productportfolio. We currently offer certified particleboards with formaldehyde-reduced glues for construction
applications, which have lower emission applications. We will also support sustainability in our processes by
continuing to generate green electricity with our own power plants and heat from wood that can no longer be
used as a material for our products, making us climate-neutral, and by feeding surplus electricity into the public
power network.

Finally, we will continue to focus on avoiding any form of environmental pollution and, pursuant to the
Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework that we adopted in connection with the Offering, we have
committed to reduce our Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions to 201.7 kT by the end of 2022 and to 173.9 kT
by the end of 2025, in each case from our baseline of 220.2 kT in 2020.

We believe that these investments and activities are not only good for the environment, but also positively
impact our Adjusted EBITDA growth due to the associated reduction in input costs per unit, and they increase
the perceived value of our products, enabling us to meet the increasing demand for sustainable products in our
end-markets.

**_Maintaining a focus on cost reduction and efficiency and pricing improvements to further increase our_**
**_margins_**

We intend to continue to focus on operational efficiencies, which we believe result in cost reductions,
ultimately allowing us to further improve margins and cash flow generation and contributing to the overall
resilience of our business. In line with these objectives, we are aiming to complete the implementation of the cost
saving initiatives that our management team actioned in 2019 and 2020. Going forward, we also plan to increase
our focus on improving raw material mix and consumption, further optimizing our headcount, decreasing indirect
costs and logistics costs, and implementing a new procurement program. Overall, we are targeting to realize
more than €25 million of cost savings through these initiatives over the next three years.

Our raw material mix and consumption improvements focus primarily on improving wood consumption,
particularly by increasing the share of recycled wood and chemicals within our total raw materials consumption,
further reducing our SKUs and increasingly adopting data-driven processes to improve raw materials yield.

We also intend to continue taking advantage of opportunities to reduce our headcount at our production
facilities and administrative functions, through a combination of redundancies, early retirement arrangements and
other FTE rationalization measures. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have negotiated the
necessary framework agreements with the worker’s council, which provide us with the necessary flexibility to
implement these plans quickly. We believe these measures, coupled with the implementation of process
optimization and further technology investments, will drive significant headcount savings. We aim at further
optimizing indirect costs that are non-labor related, such as those relating to repair, maintenance and waste
disposal services. We intend to do so by continuing to consolidate our supplier base through our re-tendering
process and focusing on tighter procurement controls. In addition, we intend to continue focusing on further
reducing our logistics costs by utilizing a centralized IT platform for logistics tenders in order to take advantage
of spot pricing conditions as opposed to contracted rates.

We expect to further benefit from the strategic price improvement measures that we initiated in 2020 and
which we intend to expand upon going forward. In particular, we will complete the strategic review of our
product pricing across our product portfolio and across all sales channels and sales regions. We also intend to
apply various price quality management actions, including price differentiation on product value, clear pricing
escalation procedures, price quality reporting and upgraded information technology systems.

**_Continuing to implement our strategic pricing initiatives_**

We continuously strive to optimize the prices for our products. In the second quarter of 2020, we engaged a
leading global consultancy firm to conduct a strategic review of pricing across our product portfolio aimed at
fixing certain structural gaps and systems and implementing new pricing rules into our ERP systems to improve
pricing discipline and invoicing. Following this strategic pricing review, we implemented a number of structural
pricing initiatives to improve pricing accuracy across all our products and customers as well as our invoicing
process. These structural pricing initiatives included (i) the automatic application of contractually agreed
surcharges to low volume orders, (ii) list price optimizations, (iii) the reduction of the number of small,
unprofitable orders and (iv) the implementation of certain other price quality management actions, including
price differentiation on product value, clear pricing escalation procedures, price quality reporting and upgraded
information technology systems. We estimate that these initiatives will have a total impact on our Adjusted
EBITDA of approximately €5.3 million by the end of 2021, of which we have included €3.0 million in our Pro
_Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020, and of approximately €15 million by the end of_
2023.

In connection with the launch of our new 2021-2024 product collection in 2021, we increased the price of
certain value-added and high value-added products of our Engineered Wood Products division. Our new
four-year year collection of value-added and high value-added products replaced our existing collection on
January 1, 2021. We estimate that these price increases will contribute €8.6 million to our Adjusted EBITDA for
the year ending December 31, 2021, which is less than 40% of agreed price increases with certain customers as
of December 31, 2020.

**_Prudent management of capital expenditure to deliver growth and maintain strong free cash flow conversion_**

Commencing in 2019, we conducted a review of our resource allocation and capital expenditure
management. Historically, our capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales has been more than 7%, primarily


13


-----

due to our significant investments into new production lines, additional capacity and debottlenecking projects.
Examples of recent investments include the installation of a lacquering line in our Leutkirch facility, the
expansion of drying capacity at our Leutkirch facility and capacity for phenolic resins, formaldehyde and
melamine in our Silekol division, and the installation of sanding lines at our Neumarkt and Baruth plants.

In addition, our high level of capital expenditure in recent years has been due to required investments into
environmental and occupational health initiatives and certain inefficient repair and maintenance investments.
These investments were essential for us to operate a stable and environmentally friendly production base. We
review investment projects both during and after implementation to check success and learn in case of deviation
from our targets, and have new procedures in place that entail reviewing capital expenditures monthly in order to
avoid budget overruns and ensure timing compliance. As a result, our capital expenditures to net sales ratio
decreased to 5.5% in 2020. We are targeting to further decrease our capital expenditures to net sales ratio to 4.5%
in the medium term. We currently have no plans to invest in new production lines and all necessary investments
required to comply with current environmental, health and safety regulations have been implemented.

We have revised our repair and maintenance approach towards condition based maintenance, which allows
for better planning and ultimately lower capital expenditures. Our maintenance capital expenditure requirements
are now relatively limited and include expenditures related to periodic plants shutdowns, replacement of
equipment, maintenance of our information technology systems and regulatory-driven expenditures. Between
2018 and 2020, maintenance capital expenditures represented approximately 3.5% of our net sales. In addition,
we plan to focus our capital expenditures into targeted projects that we believe will help us achieve our return on
investment requirements, which we have set at two years, except for a small number of strategic investments. For
example, we are currently implementing a pilot project for the installation of a scanner solution in two lines at
our Gütersloh plant which we expect to be completed at the end of 2020 and will then be rolled out to our other
plants. We expect it will take over three years to achieve returns for this project. In addition, we intend to
continue investing in debottlenecking actions in our Engineered Wood Products divisions. These actions include
the expansion of silo capacity for wood at our plant in Neumarkt and the installation of short-cycle presses at our
plant in Leutkirch, which we expect will result in additional recycling capacity during 2021. We also intend to
expand storage capacities in our Silekol division. We will continue to make selected strategic investments in
efficiency-driven projects to achieve further cost savings and increase the share of recycled wood used in our
products.

In the second half of 2019, we launched a centralized project aiming at organizing the management of our
working capital, pursuant to which we monitor all functions, such as supply chain management, procurement,
sales, controlling, treasury and accounting, in order to improve key performance indicators. We have identified
the main drivers that will help us optimize our working capital, including inventories and semi-finished and
finished-goods, in particular the composition of trade payables and trade receivables. We have also established a
new reporting standard for working capital in order to monitor working capital and target achievements. For
example, we have set clear reporting dates for balance sheet items or ratios targets, such as days payable
outstanding and days sales outstanding. We have also agreed and executed measures to adjust stocks and
decrease working capital in a sustainable manner. As a result, our net cash position has improved significantly.
Going forward, we will continue to focus on tight trade working capital management to further improve our cash
flow generation.

**The Optimization of Our Corporate Structure**

Historically, our Parent operated our business through three divisions, Engineered Wood Products, Silekol
and Panel East. Following the take private of our Parent in September 2019, to focus our operations on our core
divisions, our Sponsor separated our Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions from Panel East. We now
operate our Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions together through the Issuer, while Panel East
operates independently and on an arm’s-length basis. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Position and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—The Optimization_
_of Our Corporate Structure.”_

As a result of the optimization of our corporate structure, we believe we benefit from a strongly enhanced
credit profile due to (i) an improved business mix with strong market position in the more stable and attractive
Western European market, (ii) greater focus on value-add products with a more diversified customer base and
(iii) a higher and more resilient margin and cash flow profile. As a result, we have been able to achieve higher


14


-----

Adjusted EBITDA margins, which increased from 14.6% in 2018 to 16.9% in 2020, and in the year ended
December 31, 2020, our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.3%. In addition, our Adjusted EBITDA
_less maintenance capital expenditures increased from approximately €95 million in the year ended December 31,_
2018 to a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures of approximately €122 million in
the year ended December 31, 2020. By comparison, based on unaudited management accounts, we estimate that
Panel East’s Adjusted EBITDA margin was approximately 6% in the year ended December 31, 2018 and
approximately 12% in the year ended December 31, 2020 and that Panel East’s Adjusted EBITDA less capital
expenditure margin was approximately 4% in the year ended December 31, 2018 and approximately 10% in the
year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, based on unaudited management accounts, we estimate that Panel
East’s Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures was approximately €19 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018 and approximately €25 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

In this offering memorandum, unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Pfleiderer,” the “Group,”
“we,” “us” and “our” are to the Issuer and its Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions and exclude the
Parent and Panel East.

**The Restricted Group for the Notes**

The Restricted Group will only comprise Pfleiderer, which is made up of the Issuer and its subsidiaries and
comprises the Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions. Only Pfleiderer will provide credit support for
the Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility. The Parent and the Panel East division will be outside of the
Restricted Group and neither the assets of the Panel East division nor cash generated by the Panel East division,
including any proceeds received from the potential sale of the Panel East division by the Parent, will be available
to service or otherwise provide credit support for the Notes or the New Revolving Credit Facility.

**Recent Developments**

**_Current Trading_**

Based on preliminary results derived from our unaudited management accounts and other information
available to us, we estimate that our net sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 were
approximately €225.4 million compared to net sales of €212.3 million in the corresponding period in 2020, which
was still mostly unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic as last year’s lockdowns started to impact us only from
March 2020. We estimate that our Adjusted EBITDA for the three-month period from January 1, 2021 through
March 31, 2021 increased by approximately €7 million, or over 20%, year-on-year to approximately €41.5
million compared to €34.5 million in the corresponding period in 2020. We estimate that our Adjusted EBITDA
margin increased by more than 200 basis points from 16.3% to approximately 18.4% during the same period.

We estimate that the net sales generated in our Engineered Wood Products and our Silekol divisions in the
three-month period ended March 31, 2021 were approximately €199.1 million and approximately €39.9 million,
respectively, compared to €188.9 million and €32.0 million, respectively, in the corresponding period in 2020.
We estimate that the Adjusted EBITDA generated in our Engineered Wood Products and in our Silekol division
in the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 was approximately €35.4 million and approximately €6.2
million, respectively, compared to €30.4 million and €4.2 million, respectively, in the corresponding period in
2020. Net sales and Adjusted EBITDA of our Silekol division include, in each case, sales to our Engineered
Wood Products division.

As of April 4, 2021, the order backlog in our Engineered Wood Products division amounted to
€145.4 million, which is more than twice the historical average recorded in 2018 and 2019, and which we believe
provides us with good visibility on our sales performance in the second quarter of 2021.

_Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations” in this offering memorandum for a more complete discussion of certain of_
_the factors that could affect our future performance and results of operations._

**_Impact of COVID-19_**

Our flexible cost structure, underpinned by our relatively high share of variable and semi-variable costs, as
well as the cost savings and efficiency initiatives implemented in 2019 and 2020 enabled our solid performance
during the year 2020 which was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, in the year ended December 31,
2020, our Adjusted EBITDA increased by €8.3 million, or more than 7%, year-on-year and our Adjusted
EBITDA margin increased by 2% points compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 despite a decrease in
our sales volumes due to the Europe-wide lockdowns in the second quarter of 2020. Our Adjusted EBITDA less
maintenance capital expenditures also increased from €94.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 to
€100.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Our diversified end-market exposure has also allowed us to
benefit from a fast recovery in the general economy starting in the third quarter of 2020 further accelerated by the
growing demand for our value-added and high value-added products for the renovation and replacement segment.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting
_Our Results of Operations—COVID-19 Impact on Our Business.”_

In the first three months of 2021, many governments across the world have re-introduced restrictive
measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions and bans and mandatory social
distancing for both individuals and businesses, as well as required closures of non-essential businesses. Although
we and our suppliers and customers have implemented appropriate measures under these restrictions, we believe
that the restrictions currently in place have not had the same impact on our business as those restrictions
implemented in connection with the first wave of the pandemic in the first and second quarter of 2020. As a
result, in the first two months of 2021, we have continued to benefit from the rise in the residential renovation
and replacement segments and the recovery in the new construction segments, which has resulted in a recordhigh order backlog as of March 21, 2021.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, our plants in Germany and Poland are running at full capacity and
we believe that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations in 2021. However, COVID-19 has been evolving rapidly and we are unable to predict how
the outbreak and related government responses may affect our business in the future. We continue to monitor the
situation to ensure the safety of our employees, react to any operational developments, logistics disruptions and
macroeconomic fluctuations and assess the ongoing impact of developments on our financial condition, results of
operations, cash flows and liquidity. We expect our operations to continue to be affected by the COVID-19
pandemic for the foreseeable future and will continue to take the necessary steps to protect our employees and
mitigate the risk to our business. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Market and Our Business—The
_COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity,_
_and results of operations, which may be material.”_

- With effect from January 1, 2020, the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries located in Germany (other than Heller Holz GmbH)
became part of the Parent’s tax group for income tax purposes. For more information, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party
_Transactions—The Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement.”_

(1) Following the completion of the optimization of our corporate structure in 2020, the Panel East division is operated separately by the
Parent through Pfleiderer Polska sp.z o.o. The Parent and the Panel East division are outside of the Restricted Group and neither the
assets of the Panel East division nor cash generated by the Panel East division, including any proceeds received from the potential sale of
the Panel East division by the Parent, will be available to service or otherwise provide credit support for the Notes or the New Revolving
Credit Facility.

(2) The Issuer is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other than investments in its subsidiaries.
As a result, the Issuer depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the Notes and the
New Revolving Credit Facility.

(3) The Issuer is offering €750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured by a
first-priority security interest in the Collateral. The Collateral will also secure the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging
obligations and certain other future indebtedness permitted under the Indenture on a first-priority basis. Pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, liabilities in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other future
indebtedness permitted under the Indenture that are secured by the Collateral will be repaid with the proceeds from a distressed disposal
of, or the enforcement of, the Collateral in priority to the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

(4) On the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. Each Notes Guarantee will
be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, including the Agreed Security Principles, and certain contractual and legal
limitations. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.” By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its_
Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Guarantee.

(5) In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will provide for a
€65.0 million New Revolving Credit Facility. Initially, the Issuer, Pfleiderer Deutschland GmbH and Silekol s.p. z.o.o. will be
borrowers, but certain subsidiaries of the Issuer in Germany or Poland may accede as borrowers in the future. The New Revolving Credit
Facility is expected to be undrawn on the Issue Date. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Revolving Credit
_Facility Agreement” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

(6) The Issuer and its subsidiaries that are Guarantors held 99% of the total unconsolidated assets of Pfleiderer as of December 31, 2020, and
generated 80% of the total unconsolidated net sales and 94% of the total unconsolidated EBITDA of Pfleiderer for the year ended
December 31, 2020, in each case, before intercompany eliminations.

(7) Certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries in Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Switzerland and the United Kingdom will
not guarantee the Notes. As of December 31, 2020, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not guarantee the Notes had no outstanding
third-party debt. Any future third-party debt will rank structurally senior to the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the
Notes and the Notes Guarantees.

(8) Following the completion of the optimization of our corporate structure, Panel East operates separately from the Issuer and its
subsidiaries. Panel East will not be part of the Restricted Group and will not provide any credit support for the Notes. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of
_Operations—The Optimization of Our Corporate Structure.”_

holders of Notes, such relevant Issuer or Guarantor will,
subject to certain exceptions, pay the additional amounts

tender and do not validly withdraw such Fixed Rate Notes
or Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, in such tender offer or
offer to purchase, the Issuer will have the right to redeem all
of the Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as
applicable, that remain outstanding at a price equivalent to
the price offered to each holder of the Fixed Rate Notes or
Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, in such tender offer or

-----

Indenture, among other things, will restrict the ability of the
Issuer and each restricted subsidiary to:

                               - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue
certain preferred stock;

                               - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain
other restricted payments;

                               - make certain investments;

                               - create, incur or permit to exist certain liens;

                               - impose restrictions on the ability of the restricted
subsidiaries to pay dividends;

                               - transfer, lease or sell certain assets;

                               - impair the security interests benefiting the holders of
the Notes.

Each of these covenants is subject to significant exceptions
and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants.”_

**Original Issue Discount . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes may be issued with original issue discount
(“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the stated
redemption price at maturity of the Notes exceeds their issue
price by an amount greater than or equal to a statutorily
defined de minimis amount. If so, in addition to the stated
interest on the Notes, a U.S. Holder (as defined in “Tax
_Considerations—Certain_ _U.S._ _Federal_ _Income_ _Tax_
_Considerations”) would be required to include amounts_
representing OID in gross income on a constant yield to
maturity basis as it accrues in advance of the receipt of cash
payments attributable to such income regardless of such
holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. See “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal
_Income Tax Considerations—Original Issue Discount.”_

**Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Application will be made to The International Stock
Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing

- Our historical summary consolidated statement of cash flows reflects the effects on our cash flows from historical cash pooling
arrangements with our Parent and Panel East by way, amongst others, of intercompany loans, affecting in particular our net cash (used
in)/provided by investing activities as well as our net cash (used in)/provided financing activities, including payments made in the
context of the financing of the take private of our Parent by the Sponsor and the optimization of our corporate structure. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash
_Flows—Reported Cash Flows.” In this offering memorandum, we also present and discuss our Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the years_
ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, which excludes the effects of such intercompany transactions, which we consider to be
largely exceptional, on our cash flows. We believe Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a useful metric for investors to understand our cash flows
resulting from our operating activities. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash Flows—Adjusted Free Cash Flow.”_

(a) Includes extraordinary and non-recurring expenses relating to (i) severance payments, recruitment activities and damage to a
transformer in our Engineered Wood Products division in the year ended December 31, 2018, (ii) damage to our Baruth plant
following a fire, severance payments and recruitment activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 and (iii) damage to our Baruth
plant caused by water damage following a fire and recruitment activities in the year ended December 31, 2020.

(2) Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA (which represents our net profit for the reporting period before result of income tax, financial
income and costs, and depreciation and amortization) adjusted for certain income and expenses that we consider extraordinary,

exceptional, non-recurring or unusual in nature. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to
include certain adjustments for (a) cost savings implied by the annualized impact of cost and efficiency improvement initiatives that were
implemented in the year ended December 31, 2020 and that generated benefits only in a portion of the year (“run rate cost savings”), (b)
estimated future cost savings from cost and efficiency improvement initiatives that were partially initiated, but not fully implemented, in
the year ended December 31, 2020 and that we plan to implement in the year ending December 31, 2021, (c) estimated future cost
savings from additional cost and efficiency improvement initiatives that we plan to implement in the year ending December 31, 2021, (d)
the expected future impact of certain product pricing initiatives of the Engineered Wood Products division (such as minimum volume
surcharges on low volume orders and further differentiated price lists for different customer groups) that were implemented in our ERP
systems as of December 31, 2020 and that have been applied to new customer purchases since January 1, 2021 as if these product pricing
initiatives has been implemented in our ERP systems on January 1, 2020, and (e) the estimated impact of structural product price
increases for the value-added and high value-added products of our Engineered Wood Products division that we had agreed with certain
customers as of December 31, 2020 in the supply agreements and/or price lists applicable to future purchases by such customers as if
such price increases had been agreed on January 1, 2020. Our cost savings and efficiency improvement initiatives as well as our product
price initiatives are described in further detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Cost and Efficiency Improvement Initiatives” and “Management’s Discussion_
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Engineered Wood_
_Products Price Improvement Initiatives.” While based on current customer behavior and order backlog as well as our assumption of a_
continued and gradual recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic over the calendar year 2021, we currently expect to meet the timeframe
and amount of such cost savings initiatives, structural price improvements and price increases, we cannot guarantee that we will be able
to do so, either in the amount or within the timeframe we currently anticipate, in particular as the amount of the pricing related
adjustments may fluctuate as a result of (a) actual sales volumes achieved during the year ending December 31, 2021, (b) our actually
achieved product and customer mix in the year ending December 31, 2021 and (c) actually achieved order and shipment times during the
year ending December 31, 2021. In addition, the costs required to implement these cost savings initiatives, structural price improvements
and price increases may be higher than expected.

EBITDA-related measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measures which we
consider useful supplemental information in order to evaluate our performance. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro
_Forma Adjusted EBITDA provide investors with a useful tool for assessing our performance as they permit investors to evaluate our_
profitability from underlying operating activities. For a description of the limitations of the EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA as analytical tools, see “Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Measures.”

The following table reconciles our net profit for the reporting period, our most directly comparable measure under IFRS, to EBITDA,

€0.2 million and €0.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

(b) Represents the estimated impact of our manufacturing headcount optimization program in the amount of €1.9 million, consisting of
(i) €1.3 million in run-rate cost savings that we would have realized if we had fully implemented the redundancy measures that we
undertook during the year ended December 31, 2020 on January 1, 2020, and (ii) €0.6 million in additional cost savings that we
expect to realize in the year ending December 31, 2021 from further redundancy measures that we identified in the year ended
December 31, 2020 and that we started implementing on January 1, 2021 as if these measures had been fully implemented on
January 1, 2020. The key actions taken included a combination of redundancies, early retirement arrangements and other
rationalization measures to reduce headcount at our production facilities as well as our logistics subsidiary. For a detailed discussion
of our headcount optimization programs, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of
_Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Cost and Efficiency Improvement Initiatives—Headcount Reduction_
_Program—Manufacturing Labor.”_

(c) Represents the estimated impact of certain headcount optimization programs in our administrative functions in the amount of
€2.3 million, consisting of (i) €1.4 million in run-rate cost savings that we would have realized if we had fully implemented the
employee headcount reductions that we undertook during the year ended December 31, 2020 on January 1, 2020, and of (ii)
€0.9 million in additional expected cost savings from further employee headcount reductions that we identified in the year ended
December 31, 2020 and that we intend to implement in the year ending December 31, 2021 as if these further headcount reductions
had been fully implemented on January 1, 2020. The key actions taken included a combination of redundancies, early retirement
arrangements and other rationalization measures to reduce headcount across our sales back-office as well as supply chain and other
administrative functions. We intend to implement these actions by optimizing our processes and implementing information
technology systems to drive automation across these functions. For a detailed discussion on our SG&A cost savings initiatives, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of
_Operations—Cost and Efficiency Improvement Initiatives—Headcount Reduction Program—SG&A.”_

(d) Represents the estimated future impact of certain procurement cost savings initiatives in the amount of €1.8 million that we expect
to realize in the year ending December 31, 2021 by using the new processes and systems, which we implemented in 2019 and 2020,
when renegotiating new service and supply agreements for certain spend categories with our suppliers and vendors during 2021. For
a detailed discussion on our procurement cost savings initiatives, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position
_and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Cost and Efficiency Improvement Initiatives—_
_Procurement Cost Reduction Initiatives.” In connection with these initiatives, we incurred expenses of €1.5 million and €0.2 million_
in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, mainly relating to consulting fees and external support for the new
integrated facility management system implemented as part of this program.

(e) Represents the estimated future impact of certain material efficiency initiatives in our Engineered Wood Products division in the
amount of €4.0 million that we expect to realize from actions that we have initiated in the year ended December 31, 2020 and that
we intend to fully implement in the year ending December 31, 2021, and/or are in the process of implementing, in each case, as if
these initiatives had been fully implemented on January 1, 2020. Key actions include (i) a further increase of the percentage of
recycled wood used in our wood-based products, (ii) streamlining the number of SKUs produced from 45,000 to 30,000 in order to
reduce production complexity (implemented during 2020) and (iii) adopting data-driven processes to improve raw material yields.
Note that in particular initiatives (i) and (iii) are similar in nature to initiatives we have successfully implemented in prior years. For
a detailed discussion of our material efficiency initiatives, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and
_Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Cost Savings Measures and Efficiency Gains—Material_
_Efficiency.”_

(f) Represents the impact of certain logistics cost saving measures in the amount of €0.6 million, consisting of (i) €0.3 million in
run-rate cost savings that we would have realized if we had fully implemented the logistics cost savings that we undertook during
the year ended December 31, 2020 on January 1, 2020, and (ii) €0.3 million in additional expected cost savings from further
logistics cost saving measures that we identified in the year ended December 31, 2020 and that we intend to implement in the year
ending December 31, 2021 as if these additional measures had been fully implemented on January 1, 2020. These cost savings
initiatives mainly relate to re-tendering of certain of our logistics contracts in 2019, 2020 and 2021 In prior years, these initiatives
also resulted in the successful execution of new agreements with logistics companies in September 2019, as well as the outsourcing
of certain standard certain standard transportation services, previously performed by our in-house trucking fleet, to lower cost,
external freight forwarding companies. At the same time, our JURA logistics subsidiary started to focus on specialized
transportation services, such as round-trips completed by our walking-floor trucks. This resulted in a reduction of our in-house
trucking fleet by approximately 32% and a decrease in headcount at our JURA logistics subsidiary by 18 FTEs. For a detailed
discussion on our logistic cost savings initiatives, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of
_Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Cost and Efficiency Improvement Initiatives—Logistics Cost Reduction_
_Initiatives.”_

(g) Represents the estimated impact of cost savings from our Silekol cost saving initiatives in the amount of €1.2 million, including
(a) our Silekol energy initiative relating to the installation of a steam expander unit at our Silekol production facility, which allows
us to generate our own electricity, and (b) certain initiatives aimed at achieving raw material cost savings and adopting data-driven
processes to improve raw materials yield, consisting of (i) €0.2 million in run-rate cost savings that we would have realized if we

had implemented such energy and material efficiency initiatives that we undertook during the year ended December 31, 2020 on
January 1, 2020, and (ii) €1.0 million in additional expected cost savings from further material efficiency measures that we
identified in the year ended December 31, 2020 and that we intend to implement in the year ending December 31, 2021, in each
case, as if these additional measures had been fully implemented on January 1, 2020. For a detailed discussion on our cost savings
from our Silekol cost and efficiency improvement initiatives, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position
_and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Cost and Efficiency Improvement Initiatives—Silekol_
_Division Cost Savings._

(h) Represents the estimated future impact on our results from certain product pricing initiatives of the Engineered Wood Products
division, such as minimum volume surcharges on low volume orders, list price optimizations, the reduction in the number of small,
unprofitable orders and the implementation of certain other price quality management actions (including price differentiation on
product value, clear pricing escalation procedures, price quality reporting and upgraded information technology systems), that were
implemented in our ERP systems in the year ended December 31, 2020 and that we have applied to new customer purchases since
January 1, 2021, as if such structural pricing initiatives had been agreed on January 1, 2020 and assuming that our sales volumes
actually achieved during the year ended December 31, 2020 would have remained unchanged from sales volumes of corresponding
products to such customers during the year ending December 31, 2021. Our sales staff are unable to manually override these new
pricing rules unless such action has been approved by our Chief Operating Officer. We estimate that these new pricing rules have
positively contributed to new customer purchases since January 2021 and will further benefit our results as volumes for 2021 exceed
our 2020 volumes. Management has developed a detailed implementation together with a leading international strategic pricing
consulting firm with a proven track record in defining and implementing such measures. We intend to implement certain price
quality initiatives in the year ending December 31, 2021, which we believe will result in an additional contribution to our Adjusted
EBITDA in the amount of approximately €2.3 million in the year ending December 31, 2021. We expect the total contribution to
our Adjusted EBITDA from these initiatives to amount to approximately €15 million by the end of 2023. See also “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—_
_Engineered Wood Products Price Improvement Initiatives—Implementation of New Pricing Rules.”_

(i) Represents the estimated future impact on our results from structural product price increases across all sales channels and all sales
territories included in our new four-year collection of certain value-added and high value-added products that we had agreed with
certain customers as of December 31, 2020 in the supply agreements and/or price lists applicable to future expected purchases by
such customers, as if such price increases had been agreed on January 1, 2020 and assuming that our sales volumes of these valueadded and high value-added products with such customers actually achieved during the year ended December 31, 2020 would have
remained unchanged from sales volumes of corresponding products to such customers during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Our new four-year collection of value-added and high value-added products replaced our existing collection on January 1, 2021.
Our new collection is released once every four years. Given the high value-added nature of these products, we have historically
observed that the purchasing behavior of our customers is based on product quality and service rather than price. Preliminary results
for the two months ended February 20, 2021 have not shown an adverse volume impact of these price increases. See also,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of
_Operations—Engineered Wood Products Price Improvement Initiatives—Structural Price Increases.”_

(j) Represents certain indirect central and overhead costs, mainly related to IT, tax, accounting and legal costs, which are currently
charged to our Parent, that we expect to be charged to the Issuer following the completion of the optimization of our corporate
structure and the separation of our Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions from Panel East.

(k) _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for our Engineered Wood Products division for the year ended December 31, 2020 was_
€133.3 million and is calculated by adding the aggregate amount of estimated Engineered Wood Products division cost savings and
the aggregate estimated contribution of the Engineered Wood Products price improvement initiatives to the Adjusted EBITDA of
our Engineered Products division for the year ended December 31, 2020 and subtracting the amount of certain central and other
Parent costs. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for our Silekol division for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €18.7 million and is
calculated by adding the aggregate amount of estimated Silekol division cost savings to the Adjusted EBITDA of our Silekol
division for the year ended December 31, 2020.

(3) We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.

(4) We define “capital expenditures” as (a) additions to property, plant and equipment plus (b) additions to intangible assets excluding
emission rights plus (c) change in advances paid on fixed assets.

(a) We define maintenance capital expenditures as (a) capital expenditures used primarily for maintenance, replacement and overhaul
of plant and equipment, which is predominantly intended to maintain plant and equipment in good working order and conditions but
not to increase production capacity or optimize productivity, (b) capitalized expenditures relating to our information technology
systems, and (c) capital expenditures incurred to comply with applicable rules, laws and regulations, whether environmental or
otherwise, including but not limited to capitalized expenditures associated with the application for environmental permits and
licenses and the use, handling, disposal of or exposure to chemicals and hazardous substances (including waste and waste water)
and the control of atmospheric and water pollution (“regulatory capital expenditures”).

(b) Growth & efficiency capital expenditures primarily comprise (a) capital expenditures made in connection with maximizing the
productivity of existing production capacities and reducing manufacturing or other costs through efficiency improvement programs
(“efficiency capital expenditures”), (b) capital expenditures made in connection with expanding production capacities (“growth
capital expenditures”), and (c) capital expenditures used to reduce carbon emissions, increase the share of recycled wood used in our
manufacturing processes or otherwise reduce the impact of our activities on the environment above and beyond the requirements of
applicable rules, laws and regulations (“environmental capital expenditures”).

(5) We defined Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure margin as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure
expressed as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA.

expressed as a percentage. We have committed to increase the overall Percentage of Recycled Wood Used in our products to at least (i)
669.3 kT, or 44%, by the end of 2022 based on total wood used of 1,533.6 kT in the year ending December 31, 2022, and (ii) 772.8 kT,
or 50%, by the end of 2025 based on total wood used of 1,545.6 kT in the year ending December 31, 2025, in each case from our 2020
baseline of 545.5 kT, or 40.3%, based on total wood used of 1,354.6 kT in the year ended December 31, 2020.

(2) Represents the amount of Scope 1 & 2 CO2 Emissions generated from our operations, expressed in tons. See “Certain Definitions” for a
definition of Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions. We have committed to reduce our Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions by at
least (i) 18,493 tons, or 8.4%, to 201,670 tons by the end of 2022 and (ii) 46,234 tons, or 21.0%, to at least 173,930 tons by the end of
2025, in each case from our 2020 baseline of 220,164 tons.

_“Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Related to the Market and Our Business**

**_Our main end-markets, the kitchen, furniture and construction industries, are cyclical in nature, and demand_**
**_fluctuates based on global or regional economic and political conditions._**

We operate five wood panel manufacturing plants in Germany and one resin production plant in Poland, and
gross sales generated from the sale of products to external customers located in the DACH region represented
€421.2 million, or 60% of our consolidated gross sales, in the year ended December 31, 2020. The overall level
of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute, and consequently our financial results, are affected by
macroeconomic conditions and economic conditions in the regions in which we operate, particularly the DACH
region. Beginning in early 2020, global market and economic conditions have been negatively impacted by the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in economic downturns in most of our markets of operation. These
adverse economic conditions have reduced commercial activity, caused disruption and volatility in global
financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy which have led and may continue to lead to,
among other things, lower sales volumes from reduced demand for our products and services, deferred purchases,
price pressures and the inability of our customers to pay their obligations to us in a timely manner. In the year
ended December 31, 2020, our high margin value-added and high value-added products accounted for 78% of
gross sales from our Engineered Wood Products division and our lower margin basic products accounted for 21%
of our gross sales from our Engineered Wood Products division. If we sell fewer value-added products during an
economic downturn, particularly if we do not compensate by selling significantly more basic products, our
profitability may decline. Any major negative economic developments, including as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

Demand for our products is also impacted by economic conditions in the industries and end-markets to
which we sell our products, including the construction industry and, in particular, the kitchen and furniture
end-markets. Within the construction industry, demand for our products is primarily driven by the level of
activity in the renovation and replacement segment. In the year ended December 31, 2020, our Engineered Wood
Products division generated approximately 60% of its gross sales to customers in the kitchen and furniture
end-markets. In addition, we estimate that the renovation and replacement segment accounted for over 75% of
gross sales of the Engineered Wood Products division in the year ended December 31, 2020, while we estimate
that the new construction segment accounted for approximately 22% of gross sales generated by our Engineered
Wood Products division. Historically, the kitchen and home furnishings industries have been subject to cyclical
variations in economic activity. The level of activity in the new construction and the replacement and renovation
segments are affected by factors such as unemployment levels, household income, consumer confidence, home
equity values, home equity loan withdrawals, consumer spending habits, reasonably attainable consumer
financing, disposable household income levels as well as interest rates. The renovation and replacement segment
generally tends to be more resilient when market conditions fluctuate compared to the new construction segment
and is driven by the need to modernize existing property stock. The renovation and replacement segment is also
affected by shifting consumer preferences as well as home interior and exterior design trends.

Demand for products manufactured by our Silekol division primarily depends on the level of activity in the
German and Polish wood-based panel production industries as well as in the packaging, construction and
building materials sectors, which contributed 81.7%, 7.7%, 6.5% and 4.1%, respectively, to our Silekol

34


-----

division’s net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020. These industries are generally impacted by GDP
growth, consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit.

Further, in periods of economic uncertainty, as our production and sales decrease, our margins may decline
if we are unable to decrease our fixed costs. In the year ended December 31, 2020, our cost of sales amounted to
€554.1 million (71% of our net sales), of which 9.4% constituted fixed costs. We may be unable to reduce our
cost of sales in a timely manner, or at all in the case of some fixed costs, which may adversely affect our
business, operating results and financial condition.

Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the outlook of the world economy
remains subject to unprecedented uncertainty which may be prolonged and many national governments have
instituted rescue policies intended to prevent a financial recession. A renewed or future recession, globally or in
our countries of operation, could lead to an adverse impact on demand for our products and on our results of
operations. Adverse market conditions could impact global economic conditions which could have an adverse
economic impact on our markets. As a result, historical growth trends in our end-markets may not continue, and
a prolonged decline in the economic conditions of the markets in which we operate or any future global or
regional economic downturn, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause these industries to
deteriorate further, which could have a negative impact on our business. A significant, prolonged or unforeseen
decline in activity within our end-markets may decrease demand for our products, and therefore could have a
material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if the current economic conditions worsen or last for an
extended period of time, we may need to seek other sources of liquidity, and there can be no guarantee that
additional liquidity will be readily available or available on favorable terms or in an amount sufficient to enable
us to service and repay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. Any deterioration in financial
markets could impair our ability to obtain financing in the future, including our ability to incur additional
indebtedness to continue our ongoing operations or fund liquidity needs and we could be forced to scale back our
business operations or growth plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
conditions and results of operations.

**_The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition,_**
**_liquidity, and results of operations, which may be material._**

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global commerce has been far-reaching and will continue to be
disruptive in the near future. In response to COVID-19, many countries around the world, including where we
manufacture and sell our products, implemented a variety of measures to reduce the spread of the virus, including
travel restrictions and bans, social distancing required for both individuals and businesses, shelter-in-place and
lockdown orders and required closures of non-essential businesses. These restrictions have resulted, among other
things, in significant disruptions to business operations, supply chains and customer activity and demand, service
cancellations or reductions and other changes. From time to time during the COVID-19 pandemic, these
restrictions have also disrupted our supply-chains, decreased customer demand for some of our products,
particularly in the kitchen and furniture end-markets, required us to transition a portion of our workforce to
working from home and adversely impacted our ability to arrange for transport of our raw materials and
products.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted demand for some of our products and we may not be
successful in allocating resources to address rapidly shifting demand among our product lines. In the second
quarter of 2020, net sales in our Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions decreased sharply by
approximately 19.4% and 32.9%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2019. This was primarily due
to the fact that the kitchen and home furnishing industries in Europe came under temporary pressure as a result of
the various restrictions implemented by governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related
negative effects on the overall economic conditions in our key geographical markets. In particular, kitchen and
furniture producers in Germany and Poland had to temporarily shut down their production facilities as a result of
the lockdown orders imposed in connection with the outbreak of the pandemic. Accordingly, demand for our
products from these industries declined, in particular in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period
in 2019. While in the third and fourth quarter the demand for the products of both our Engineered Wood Products
and our Silekol divisions recovered to pre-pandemic levels and then continued to grow, the recovery and growth
we experienced in the second half of 2020 were not sufficient to fully compensate the decline in demand during
the second quarter of 2020, and our overall sales volumes and net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020
remained below 2019 levels. If the COVID-19 pandemics leads to renewed shutdowns or if economic disruption
from COVID-19 continues, our net sales and sales volumes may continue to be negatively affected.

35


-----

The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to control the spread of the virus are
uncertain and may materially restrict or hinder our ability to operate our facilities, due to measures we may need
to take to assure the health and safety of our employees, lack of available workforce, disruptions in the supply of
key raw materials and services or restrictions due to governmental actions. In addition, compliance with social
distancing, cleaning and other health and safety measures implemented in response to COVID-19 in the various
countries in which we operate may be burdensome and could result in the incurrence of additional costs and
penalties.

The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our future operational and financial performance will depend on
future developments, including the effectiveness and availability of vaccines and further restrictive actions taken
by various governmental authorities in response to new strains of the virus, termination of government support
programs and the timing of recovery of the overall economy, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be
predicted. While certain governments have initiated vaccination programs against COVID-19, it remains unclear
if or when the pandemic will cease and whether previously-lifted measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19
may be reinstated.

There can no assurance that the outbreak of COVID-19 or any future outbreak of another virus or other
contagious diseases will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of
operations. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience material adverse
impacts to our businesses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic’s global economic impact, including any related
recession.

**_We operate in a competitive industry and our results may be adversely affected by competition._**

We compete with large scale engineered wood panel manufacturers and numerous small producers. Our
competitive position is determined by various factors, including price, product quality and reliability, breadth of
product range (including design and decorative features), the ability to meet customers’ requirements, brand
recognition and customer loyalty, manufacturing capabilities, distribution channels, scope and quality of services,
product design and innovation and sustainability. Certain competitors also focus on specific industry niches
based on price or product quality while others, including us, compete in a broad range of products, prices and
markets.

Some of our competitors may benefit from certain competitive advantages that we do not benefit from, such
as having easier access to financing, access to certain new technologies, more comprehensive product offerings
in certain business lines or markets, greater personnel resources, fewer regulatory burdens and longer-established
relationships with regulatory authorities, customers and suppliers. Competitors may develop new products,
particularly value-added and high value-added products, or processes that could allow them to offer products at a
cost or quality that has a significant advantage over our products or to more adequately address customer
preferences, and we may not have sufficient resources or capital to match such innovation or react to changing
customer preferences in a timely fashion, if at all. Pressure to compete in a new product area could require
significant expenditures to develop a competitive product or could require us to reduce prices on our existing
products to limit sales volumes lost.

We also experience price pressure from competitors in certain product lines and markets, in particular basic
products and industrial resins. Since these products do not have significant distinguishing qualities and are more
uniform across different producers, competition is primarily based on price, and price pressure has historically
intensified during periods of economic downturn and weaker consumer demand as manufacturers attempt to
maintain their capacity utilization through price competition. Some competitors have also sought to gain
increased control over their raw material costs by vertically integrating their operations, such as by acquiring
forest land in order to source a portion of their wood requirements. We believe that developing and maintaining a
competitive advantage will require continued investment by us in product development, manufacturing
capabilities, sales and marketing and customer relationships. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient
resources to make the necessary investments in the future.

The majority of the European wood-based panel industry’s production sites are located in Central and
Western Europe, with a significant concentration in Germany, eastern France, northern Italy, Austria and Poland.
Because all of our wood panel production plants are located in Germany, we may experience competition from
manufacturers in other nearby countries that are able to manufacture products at lower cost or that are located
closer to customers. This is particularly true in the furniture market, as some furniture producers have moved part
or all of their production from Germany and other higher-cost locations to Eastern Europe, causing some woodbased panel producers to also shift their production capacity to such region to reduce transportation costs by

being located closer to furniture producers. Should this trend continue or accelerate, we may be forced to lower
our prices to maintain our competitiveness, or we may be unable to continue to sell our products at current or
anticipated volumes. In either case, our sales and our gross profit could decline and such decline could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Any failure to compete successfully in our industry would adversely affect our business, operating results
and financial condition.

**_A significant decrease in demand or an increase in production capacities might lead to overcapacity in our_**
**_markets, which could cause a reduction of the utilization rates of our production plants and decreased sales_**
**_prices._**

Overcapacity in the wood-based panel industry has a strong negative influence on the pricing power of
producers, and it is important for us to find a balance between our production capacity and the demand for our
products in each of our production plants as well as the markets in which we are active. A significant decrease in
demand, including due to a cyclical weakness of the kitchen, furniture and construction industries or our other
end-markets, or delays in the capacity adjustment process, may result in overcapacity and a reduction in the
utilization rates of our plants as well as those of our competitors in our respective geographic markets. In
addition, production policies of our competitors fluctuate and could frustrate our efforts to maintain such a
balance. It is possible that competitors or new market entrants could seek to invest in new plants or a competitor
could reactivate decommissioned facilities or expand existing plants. Decreases in demand and increases in
production capacity that result in overcapacity may lead to increased price competition or reduced demand for
our products. Overcapacity could therefore have a negative impact on our profitability because high capacity
utilization at our production facilities leads to a reduction in our production costs per unit and our fixed costs
being spread across larger volumes, resulting in higher profitability.

There is also a risk that the amount of capital expenditures we spent between 2018 and 2020, respectively,
for improvements will result in production capacity which we will not be in a position to utilize at the level at
which we planned, including if customer demand unexpectedly weakened as result of the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic. Failure to adequately utilize our production capacities has led, and could in the future lead, to reduced
net sales, depreciation on production equipment and impairment charges on goodwill. Any inabilities to optimize
our plants’ capacity utilization and recognize improved cost efficiencies due to improvements in production
processes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Failure to successfully anticipate or respond to changes in consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner_**
**_could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition._**

Sales of our value-added and high-value added products are particularly dependent upon consumer
acceptance of our product styles, quality and price, and our customers continually evaluate our products in
comparison to those offered by our competitors. The development and commercialization of new products
requires investments in research and development, production and marketing. The successful production and
commercialization of new products is uncertain and any new products may not be attractive to our customers or
end users.

While we continuously monitor changes in design trends through internal and external marketing research
and regular communication with our retailers, who provide valuable input on consumer tendencies, our business
continues to be susceptible to rapidly changing consumer tastes and trends. If we or our customers fail to
successfully anticipate or respond to changing end-customer tastes and trends in a timely manner, including in
relation to the materials and applications desired or required by end customers, such as sustainable materials,
consumer acceptance of the merchandise we sell may be harmed, which could reduce sales of our products.
Consumer demand is difficult to accurately forecast and incorrect forecasts of demand or unforeseen reductions
in demand can adversely affect our costs and profitability due to factors such as underused manufacturing
capacity, excess inventory and maintaining excess working capital. Our forecasting systems and modelling tools
may not accurately predict changes in demand for our products or other market conditions, such that our sales,
financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, where we sell our products
through our direct sales channel, if our customers decline to purchase our new products, we may not be able to
recover our development investment and our financial position and results of operations could be adversely
affected. Where we sell our products through our indirect sales channel, we typically agree to provide a catalogue
of product collections averaging three years and to the extent our end customers decline to purchase our new
products, we may strain or lose customer relationships with our wholesale, retail or other distribution customers.

37


-----

We have recently focused on increasing digitalization in our business, sales and customer service processes,
including to increase customer outreach and generate demand from specific target groups; however there can be
no assurance that such investments will be successful. Even where interest in our new products is high and our
sales processes are effective, we may face risks related to production delays, cost over-runs and unanticipated
technical difficulties, which could also adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_Our business may be negatively affected by an increase in prices of raw materials, energy and other inputs._**

As a manufacturer of wood-based and chemical products, we primarily rely on raw materials, energy and
labor as well as repair and maintenance materials and services at our production facilities. Raw materials and
other inputs required for the production of our products are the largest component of our cost of sales and
therefore the cost and availability of such raw material and other inputs are critical to our operations. Our profit
margins are largely driven by the relationship between the prices that we are able to charge for our products and
the cost of the raw materials and other inputs we require to produce these products. The raw materials and other
inputs we primarily depend on are wood, chemicals, paper, energy and other raw materials. In the year ended
December 31, 2020, the cost of these wood, chemicals, paper, energy and other raw materials amounted to a total
of €364.5 million, or 47%, of our consolidated net sales (with raw material costs and energy used amounting to
€310.6 million, or 45%, of net sales of our Engineered Wood Products division and €86.9 million, or 72%, of net
sales of our Silekol division). Of these raw material costs and energy used, the cost of wood represented 22%, the
cost of chemicals represented 40%, the cost of paper represented 18% and the cost of energy represented 6%. Of
our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, the cost of wood represented 11%, the cost of
chemicals represented 19%, the cost of paper represented 8% and the cost of energy represented 3%. The
availability and cost for most of our raw materials is primarily influenced by prevailing macroeconomic
conditions and the general macroeconomic outlook and, historically, raw material prices have decreased during
an economic downturn and increased during periods of economic expansion. In addition, the cost for our raw
materials is influenced by the supply and demand levels in the relevant raw material markets, which may in turn
be influenced by the production capacities of our suppliers and other factors beyond our control. We aim to
mitigate risks from fluctuating raw material prices by entering into supply agreements with a duration of three,
six or twelve months to cover a significant portion of our raw material requirements, and hedging our energy
costs; however, there can be no assurance that these measures will turn out to be sufficient.

Wood fiber as a commodity, is our principal raw material, and prices have been historically cyclical in
response to changes in demand and supply. Sustained periods of high wood costs may impair the cost
competitiveness of our manufacturing facilities. Wood supply is mainly driven by local dynamics and is
influenced by factors such weather (including adverse weather events such as droughts, storms or fires),
infestations of insects or pests and diseases, all of which are beyond our control and that of our suppliers. If we
are unable to negotiate purchases for our wood fiber requirements in a particular region to satisfy our wood
material needs at satisfactory prices or at all, which could include private purchases, open-market purchases, and
purchases from governmental sources, our business, operating results and financial condition could be negatively
affected. In addition, we seek to only source wood from suppliers who are able to verify the district of origin for
“controlled wood,” which refers to wood from sustainably managed or certified forests or recycled wood, which
has provided us with certification by the FSC[®] (Forest Stewardship Council). Any loss of FSC[®] certification
would result in a loss of net sales from customers requiring FSC[®] certification.

Additionally, resin is a key input material to the manufacturer of our products. Prices for resins are
indirectly dependent on the price of crude oil, methanol and urea, which have historically shown significant
volatility. Rising oil prices could lead to significantly increased resin prices and affect our ability to source a
sufficient supply of resin without affecting our profitability. Furthermore, through our Silekol division, we
produce over 400,000 tons of resin per year and in the year ended December 31, 2020, the sale of resin by our
Silekol division to external customers accounted for €54.8 million, or 7% of our consolidated net sales. Increases
in the price of oil may result in an increase in the production costs of our Silekol division, which we may not be
able to pass through to our customers in a timely manner, if at all, and which may have an adverse effect on the
results of our Silekol division. Similarly, a decrease in oil prices may lead to a reduction in prices which we can
charge our external customers, which may also have an adverse effect on the results of our Silekol division.

Our business is dependent on the steady supply of significant amounts of energy in various forms, such as
electricity, wood, gas, heating oil and steam, at commercially reasonable terms. In particular, the wood
preparation process in the production of raw particleboards and MDF and HDF products requires considerable
amounts of energy. Our energy cost, which mainly consists of cost for the supply of electricity, wood, gas and
heating oil incurred in connection with the production of our products, accounts for a high percentage of our

38


-----

production costs. In the year ended December 31, 2020, our energy cost amounted to 4.4% of our cost of sales
(excluding depreciation and amortization). Energy cost is affected by various factors, including the availability of
supplies of particular sources of energy, energy prices and regulatory decisions. In particular, prices for oil, gas
and electricity are typically extremely volatile. For example, crude oil prices ranged between less than $22 and
more than $130 per barrel between 2008 and 2020, and year-on-year changes in the cost of electricity ranged
from a trough of -4% to a high of 21% between 2017 and 2020. Such volatility may increase as a result of current
political instability or the promoted growth of renewable energy sources, especially in Germany (Energiewende)
and Europe. We attempt to mitigate risks of fluctuating energy prices by operating our own combined heat and
power (“CHP”) plants at our plants in Baruth, Gütersloh and Neumarkt. While the majority of our energy needs
are covered by our own biomass-based CHP plants, we cover our additional electricity needs by entering into
annual contracts for approximately 60% to 70% of our additional electricity demand as well as short-term
forward contracts for a further 20% to 30% of the energy we purchase. However, there can be no assurance that
these measures will turn out to be adequate. For example, our own CHP plants may prove uncompetitive due to
price increases for the fuels used (wood, heating oil or gas), regulatory intervention or operational difficulties and
our outside suppliers may default on their obligations under our energy purchase agreements. Any significant
increase in market prices, transportation costs, grid fees or taxes (including by reduction of tax benefits)
associated with the supply of energy would increase our operating costs. Any inability or delay in passing on
increases in energy cost to our customers or any interruption or shortage of energy supply may negatively impact
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our inability to pass on price increases for raw materials or other inputs to our customers could adversely_**
**_affect our results of operations._**

Our results of operations are affected by the speed and the extent to which we can pass through price
increases in raw materials, energy, transportation and other key cost items to our customers. Our ability to pass
through increases in the prices of raw materials to our customers depends, among others, on prevailing
competitive conditions, our contracts with a given customer, the buying power of our customers and pricing
methods in the markets in which we operate. While we benefit from contractual pass-through of raw material
costs in our Silekol division, we need to actively manage the pass-through in our dealings with customers in our
Engineered Wood Products division. Product prices in customer contracts in our Engineered Wood Products
division are typically fixed for the term of the agreements; however, the duration of such agreements tends to be
relatively short, with average terms of three to six months. While this generally short duration allows us to adjust
product prices based on changes in raw material prices on a relatively regular basis, we may not be successful in
passing through increases in the price of raw materials to our customers, particularly for our basic products and
industrial resins which do not have significant distinguishing qualities and are more uniform across different
producers and where, therefore, competition is primarily based on price. This has historically limited our ability
to increase the price of our basic products and industrial resins to pass increased raw material costs to our
customers, particularly when supply levels are higher than demand levels.

Even if we are able to pass through increases in prices, there is typically a time lag between cost increases
affecting our business and the implementation of product price increases, during which time our margins may be
negatively impacted. Recovery of cost inflation can also lead to disparities in the product prices of different
brands and can result in a competitive disadvantage and volume decline of our products. During our negotiations
to increase our prices to recover cost increases, customers may take actions which exacerbate the impact of such
cost increases, by, for example, ceasing to use or offer our products or deferring orders until negotiations have
ended. Our inability to pass through price increases in raw materials and preserve our profit margins in the future
could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our business may be negatively affected by our inability to retain or replace our key customers or maintain or_**
**_raise prices in the future due to potential further consolidation and internal growth among our customer base._**

Our business may be negatively affected by a loss of key customers. Although no single customer of either
the Engineered Wood Products division or the Silekol division accounted for more than 5% of such division’s net
sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, some individual customers are more important for the sale of certain
of our product groups, such as those specific to their end-market, and for the utilization of specific production
facilities, since we have developed our production facilities to focus on specific customers and product groups. If
we are forced to reduce prices or maintain prices during periods of increased costs, or if we lose customers
because of pricing, other methods of competition or their shutdowns or insolvency, our net sales, operating
results and financial position may be materially adversely affected. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,

39


-----

certain of our customers temporarily halted their operations, reduced orders or postponed their demand, which
resulted in a 2% decrease in sales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019.

In 2020, our Engineered Wood Products division’s top ten external customers generated 18% of its external
net sales and our Silekol division’s top ten external customers represented 61% of its external net sales
(excluding sales to our Engineered Wood Products division and Panel East). Certain of our key customers have
historically operated as large companies with significant buying power and other customers have recently
expanded through consolidation and internal growth, which has increased their buying power. Potential further
consolidation among our customer base could enhance the ability of those customers to seek more favorable
terms, including pricing, for the products that they purchase from us. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or raise
prices in the future may be limited, in particular during periods of raw material and other cost increases, which
could negatively impact our margins and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Our business may be negatively affected by disruptions to our supply chain or our inability to retain or replace_**
**_our key suppliers._**

If the availability of any of our raw materials is limited, including as a result of production issues at our
suppliers or if our suppliers cannot themselves source raw materials, whether due to transportation disruptions,
such as the current disruption in the Suez Canal, or otherwise, we may be unable to produce some of our products
in the quantities demanded by our customers, which could have an adverse effect on plant utilization and our
sales of products requiring such raw materials, and could negatively impact our business, financial condition or
results of operations. Continued availability of raw materials is dependent on our supplier base. We have
historically relied on a few suppliers to provide a significant percentage of our raw materials, and in the year
ended December 31, 2020, our top ten suppliers of chemicals for our Engineered Wood Products division
accounted for 76% of its total chemical purchases, our top ten suppliers of paper for our Engineered Wood
Products division accounted for 82% of its total paper purchases and our top ten suppliers of wood for our
Engineered Wood Products division accounted for 56% of its total wood purchases. In the year ended
December 31, 2020, our top ten suppliers of chemicals for our Silekol division accounted for 94% of its chemical
costs. Almost all of our decorative paper is sourced from Europe, with small quantities being sourced in Asia. In
addition, we source the majority of our raw materials from suppliers in close proximity to our production plants
to minimize transport costs. Because of the high cost of transport vis-à-vis the low margins achievable in sales
from our basic products and industrial resins, in particular, we are often dependent on local suppliers to maintain
our margins. Our use of smaller, local suppliers may also result in occasional supply irregularities if the local
suppliers experience financial difficulties. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020, we faced longer
delivery times, particularly for supply orders requiring cross-border transportation. In connection with the
COVID-19 pandemic, it became more difficult to source recycled wood, as a result of which we were required to
purchase higher volumes of sawmill products and round wood, which have higher costs compared to recycled
wood. Furthermore, we may not be able to renew our agreements or enter into new agreements with our key
suppliers upon expiration of existing supply agreements. An interruption in our business relationship or
termination of our relationships with our key suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations and
financial condition and we may not be able to find a substitute in a short period of time or at all, which would
have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

**_The availability of, or any significant increase in the cost of, transportation represents a significant risk for_**
**_our business._**

Transportation plays an important part in our supply chain as we ship a majority of our products, mainly by
truck and to a lesser extent by rail or ship, to our customers. In the year ended December 31, 2020, less than 5%
of our customers collected their product orders directly from our production facilities. As a result, increases in
transportation costs, such as those caused by an increase in fuel costs or road tolls, have a noticeable effect on our
results. Deliveries for our Engineered Wood Products division are often made as full truck loads, but where
customers order small quantities, we consolidate different customer orders into a single truck to achieve a full
truck load. A single delivery truck can therefore have multiple unloading points to serve different customers’
delivery addresses. Further, most of our raw materials need to be delivered to our production facilities. In the
year ended December 31, 2020, our transportation costs, which include freight for deliveries from our production
plants or other stocks to customers amounted to a total of €53.6 million, or 7%, of our net sales. In the third
quarter of 2020, we finalized the rationalization and specialization of our own transportation fleet, reducing our

40


-----

fleet from 53 trucks in the year ended December 31, 2019 to 36 leased trucks as of September 30, 2020. Through
our fleet we carry out approximately 11% of our transportation needs. The remaining 89% of our transportation
needs are carried out by third parties. Therefore, we are dependent on the timely performance of these third-party
transporters. In addition, in cases where we rely on third parties for our transportation needs, our ability to
service our customers at commercially reasonable costs depends on our ability to negotiate commercially
reasonable logistics terms. To the extent that such third-party service providers increase their rates, for example,
as a result of higher labor, maintenance, fuel or other costs they may incur, or due to other factors, such as
capacity shortages or consolidations, we may be forced to pay such increased rates without being able to pass
through such increased transportation costs to our customers.

Any material disruption in or lack of availability of transportation, for example, as a result of the recent
temporary closure of the Suez Canal, or significant increases in fuel or energy prices, road tolls or demand-driven
market prices resulting in higher transportation costs, may have a material adverse effect on our business and our
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased costs relating to vehicle emissions control
requirements that have been or may be imposed in the future, particularly due to climate change-related
legislation, may also lead to such effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our contracts do not usually contain minimum purchase requirements or “take or pay” provisions, and, as a_**
**_result, we are subject to uncertainties and variability in demand by customers, which could decrease sales and_**
**_materially adversely affect our financial results._**

Our contracts typically do not contain minimum purchase requirements or “take or pay” provisions and our
sales are subject to fluctuations in demand, which can be difficult to predict and may fluctuate from year to year
and even from quarter to quarter. The level and timing of orders placed by our customers vary for a variety of
reasons, including individual customer strategies, the introduction of new technologies, the availability of more
suitable value-added products in our competitors’ product portfolios, the desire of our clients to reduce their
exposure to any single supplier and general economic conditions. If we are unable to anticipate future volumes,
we may not have an adequate supply of raw materials with which to manufacture our products or may have
insufficient capacity in our sites, or if demand turns out to be lower than we anticipate, we may have excess
inventory. For example, in the event of an unexpected surge in demand for our products, we may not have
sufficient recycling capacity at our plants, which could create production bottlenecks and force us to use fresh
wood instead of recycled wood and, in turn, this could lead to increased production costs or us failing to meet our
commitment to increase the overall Percentage of Recycled Wood Used in our products to at least 44% by the
end of 2022 and 50% by the end of 2025. Any of the foregoing, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial position and operating results.

**_Our operations require substantial capital expenditures and we may not generate sufficient cash flow to fund_**
**_our capital expenditure requirements._**

Historically, our capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales has been more than 7%, primarily due to
our significant investments into new production lines, additional capacity and debottlenecking projects. Overall,
in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, our capital expenditure amounted to €49.1 million,
€43.5 million and €40.1 million, respectively, for our Engineered Wood Products division and €8.7 million,
€3.1 million and €2.7 million, respectively, for our Silekol division, with capital expenditure in the year ended
December 31, 2020 strategically reduced as part of the cost saving measures we implemented during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Although we maintain our production equipment with regular periodic and scheduled
maintenance, there can be no assurance that key pieces of equipment in our various manufacturing facilities will
not need to be repaired or replaced or that we will not incur significant additional costs associated with
environmental compliance. Future capital expenditures to expand our business, replace existing facilities or
equipment or to comply with future changes in environmental laws and regulations may be substantial. The costs
of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Furthermore, we may
require information technology enhancements in order to continue providing high-quality customer service.
Failure to implement such enhancements may result in reduced quality of customer service and the loss of
customers. If, for any reason, we are unable to provide for our operating needs, capital expenditures, and other
cash requirements on economic terms, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_The adjustments to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA annualizing the impact of certain cost savings measures_**
**_and giving effect to expected benefits from certain price improvement initiatives as presented in this offering_**
**_memorandum should be treated with caution when making an investment decision._**

The adjustments to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA annualizing the impact of certain cost saving measures,
adding back expected synergies from certain operational improvement initiatives and giving effect to benefits
from our l price improvement initiatives presented in this offering memorandum should be treated with caution
when making an investment decision. The assumptions we have made with respect to Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA that we present in this offering memorandum are based on our current estimates and expectations and
they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or
achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such adjusted financial information. We may not be able to realize the estimated cost
savings and price improvements, either in the amount, within the timeframe we currently anticipate or at all, and
the costs of achieving these cost savings and price improvements may be higher than expected. In addition, there
can be no assurance that sales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2020 would have remained at the same
level, had our price increases and price improvement initiatives been implemented from January 1, 2020.

Our anticipated cost savings, run-rate cost savings and expected price improvements are based upon
assumptions about our ability to implement cost saving measures and price improvement initiatives in a timely
fashion and within certain cost parameters. Our ability to achieve planned cost savings, run-rate cost savings and
price improvements is dependent upon a significant number of assumptions, some of which may be beyond our
control. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these measures proves to have been incorrect,
these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or
realize in the anticipated timeframe, the expected benefits from our cost savings and operational measures as well
as our price improvement initiatives. Furthermore, pricing pressure from our customers or from our competitors,
lower sales volumes or other variables may deprive us of some of the benefits from the cost savings and
operational measures as well as our price improvement initiatives that we assumed that we would be able to
retain. In addition, cost savings, operational efficiencies from improved production processes and from enhanced
procurement terms as well as price improvements may not be able to be sustained due to, among other things,
changes in customer needs, changes in competitor behavior, changes in environmental laws and regulations,
availability and cost of raw materials or other cost variables. Our new business initiatives could also result in
unintended consequences, such as the loss of key customers and suppliers. These factors may offset the cost
savings and price improvements we anticipate and which we have included in our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.
Consequently, our inability to realize our anticipated cost savings and price improvements could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

**_Our energy costs are dependent on the regulatory framework for the energy sector, which is subject to_**
**_constant change and, in addition, we may face material cost increases if the financial privileges which we_**
**_benefit from are revoked._**

The operation of our business entails the consumption of considerable amounts of energy and, as a result,
our financial condition and results of operations are affected by our energy costs. Among other factors, these
costs are influenced by the relevant regulatory framework for the energy sectors both on the European and the
national level. In Germany, our energy costs are directly affected by relief benefits that we are granted annually,
including the EEG relief for energy intensive consumers, grid cost relief and energy tax relief for highly efficient
CHP plants. In addition, the German government grants feed-in electricity tariffs (meaning, remunerations) as an
incentive to invest in renewable energy technologies. The German Federal Network Agency can also increase or
decrease grid operators’ prices and grant grid cost relief for companies with predictable and consistent
consumption to encourage grid stability. The Combined Heat and Power Act of 2021 provides energy tax relief
for efficient CHP plants like ours, which amounted to a total of €6.1 million in the year ended December 31,
2020. In addition, we have historically received grid cost reliefs in three plants (Gütersloh, Neumarkt and Baruth)
which amounted €3.6 million per year, and a concession relief of €0.4 million. However, the applicable
regulatory frameworks have historically been subject to substantial change and it will continue to be subject to
change in the future. Such change is not only due to legislative reforms, but is also prompted by administrative
and judicial decisions. Any loss of relief in the future, including as a result of changes to the prerequisites for
these exemptions, could lead to an increase in our energy costs, which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, we produce electricity in our own CHP plants in Neumarkt, Gütersloh and Baruth that we sell
to external customers through a state-granted fixed “EEG feed-in tariff.” In 2020, the price guarantee under the

42


-----

EEG feed-in tariff was extended until 2026 for all our biomass CHP plants, with a progressive phasing out
starting from 2023. While such extension came into force under German energy law, it remains subject to final
approval by the European Commission, which is currently expected in the second quarter of 2021. If the
European Commission does not approve the extension or, in any event, if the price guarantee is not renewed after
its new expiration date, we will no longer be able to sell electricity at the price guarantee under the EEG feed-in
tariff and we will have to conduct electricity sales at market rates that are subject to fluctuation over time. As a
result of the currently scheduled progressive reduction of the EEG feed-in tariff, we currently estimate our net
sales form energy sales will progressively decrease over the coming years. Further legislative or regulatory
changes in the future may further decrease our electricity sales margin and thereby could materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The EU REACH Committee previously reclassified formaldehyde and titanium dioxide as a carcinogen, and_**
**_may do the same in the future in respect of additional chemicals or materials used in our production_**
**_processes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

We have historically used and continue to use formaldehyde as our primary bonding agent in the production
of our wood-based panel products. Formaldehyde has been reclassified by the International Agency for Research
on Cancer as carcinogenic to humans and, in December 2013, the EU REACH Committee adopted a decision to
reclassify formaldehyde as a “category 1B carcinogen” (presumed to have carcinogenic potential for humans,
classification largely based on animal evidence). The reclassification of formaldehyde significantly affected
emission standards, workplace health and safety regulations and other regulations applying to our products,
resulting in lower limit values, including those imposed by the German government. We have made changes in
our production processes in order to comply with the regulations relating to the reclassification, such as
installation of new ventilation systems in our press hall and changes to our gluing and board production systems.
We cannot exclude the possibility that material investments may be required in order to continue to comply with
new regulatory standards. In February 2020, the European Commission published a regulation classifying
titanium dioxide as a “category 2 carcinogen” (presumed to have carcinogenic potential for humans,
classification largely based on animal evidence), which will apply starting from September 2021. In addition, we
cannot exclude the possibility that additional chemicals or other materials used in our production processes may
be formally designated as harmful or become subject to additional regulation. For example, in December 2020,
the risk assessment committee of the European Commission proposed to reclassify melamine, which is used in
our products, as a “category 2 carcinogen.” The classification of these or additional chemicals and other materials
used in our production process as harmful may result in the obligation to dispose internal waste containing such
substances as hazardous waste, which could lead to significantly increased disposal costs. These classifications
could also affect regulations applying to our products and force us to make changes to our production processes,
which may be costly and could negatively impact our business and results of operations In addition, extensive
new regulation, in particular if implemented asymmetrically among EU member states or which results in the
substitution of some of our industry’s products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could result in
material costs, liabilities to us or requirements to make capital expenditures or restrict our ability to conduct our
business.

We are subject to a wide range of environmental, health and safety requirements, including those governing
the control of atmospheric and water pollution, the use, handling, treatment, storage, transport and disposal of
chemicals, hazardous materials and wastes, the makeup of our products and the protection of human health and
safety. All of our operations require environmental permits and other approvals that are subject to modification,
renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. The loss of these permits, certificates and other approvals could
adversely affect our operations. We could incur substantial costs, including investment costs for the
modernization of our facilities, compliance costs, fines, penalties and other sanctions, suspension of operating
permits or operations, investigation and cleanup costs and third-party claims for property damage or personal
injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety requirements and permits.

Although we attempt to monitor and reduce accidents in our production plants through our safety program,
“One Safety,” we remain exposed to risks of incidents such as explosions, fires, vehicular accidents, other
incidents involving mobile equipment, or exposure to potentially hazardous materials. Any such incident may
lead to production stoppages, loss of key personnel or assets as well as environmental contamination and subject
employees and third parties living near the affected facilities to health and safety risk. Any failure by us to
prevent a health, safety or environmental risk from occurring and causing damage or loss may materially
adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we spent approximately €1.3 million, €2.1 million
and €0.5 million, respectively, on costs to comply with environmental requirements for our Engineered Wood
Products division and approximately €0.2 million, €0.1 million and €0.1 million, respectively, on costs to comply
with environmental requirements for our Silekol division. Costs include the treatment and discharge of waste and
waste water, the use, handling, generation and disposal of chemicals and hazardous substances (including
industrial waste) and exposure to such substances and control of atmospheric and water pollution. These
requirements change often and tend to become more stringent over time. In particular, our production plants are
subject to the EU Industrial Emissions Directive (“IED”), which was transposed into German law in 2020. The
IED provides for close monitoring and inspection of certain industrial plants by the competent authorities,
increased reporting duties for the relevant operators as well as enhanced public participation in administrative
decision-making processes. Furthermore, the IED also introduced an EU-wide regime of emission limit values
based on the best available techniques (“BAT”) for each relevant industry sector. These emission limit values are
adopted and updated at regular intervals on the EU-level as part of so-called BAT Reference Documents
(“BREFs”) and are subsequently required to be implemented in each EU member state through binding national
law. As a result of the IED, emission limit values for the engineered wood industry, including in relation to glue
and formaldehyde, have been lowered by the authorities. Like our competitors, we have had to apply for an
exemption in relation to the lowered limit values for formaldehyde emissions. The loss of such exemption could
mean that our products or operations no longer comply with the mandatory limit values. Additional laws and
regulations, or changes in existing laws and regulations, in the future could increase our costs or restrict our
ability to manufacture or market our products. The implementation of further reductions of emission limit values
and further tightened environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

All of our facilities emit carbon dioxide in the ordinary course of our operations. In the EU, the right to emit
such gas is regulated by the possession of emission rights, which are granted and allotted by the competent public
authorities. Our operating sites in Germany have sufficient emission rights for their present operations,
particularly because we benefit from certain privileges available to certain energy-intensive industries. Any loss
of the necessary emission rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

As an owner and as an operator of industrial properties, we are subject to potential liabilities and obligations
relating to environmental conditions, particularly contaminations of soil groundwater and buildings at our current
facilities and former sites as well as neighboring properties, including investigation, cleanup, containment,
decommissioning or closure obligations. In certain circumstances, such liabilities and obligations may be
imposed on us without regard to fault or current ownership of the respective site. The soil and ground water of a
plot of land in Neumarkt, which we currently use as a wood storage site, are contaminated. The plot is owned by
a former Group company which is currently in insolvency proceedings, and which is responsible for the relevant
remediation obligations. We cannot guarantee that the competent government authorities will not ask us to
contribute to the remediation activities in the future based on our usage of the land. Although we are not aware of
any other sites at which we have or may encounter material investigation or cleanup obligations, we could incur
substantial additional costs as a result of the discovery of contamination or the imposition of cleanup obligations
at our sites in the future.

**_We may be adversely affected by laws, regulations or other issues related to climate change._**

The European Union has enacted laws relating to climate change, and may enact further new laws on
climate change in the future, including potential cap-and-trade systems, carbon taxes or other requirements
relating to reduction of carbon footprints or Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Although these laws and regulations
have not had any known material adverse effect on us to date, they could limit our ability to develop new
facilities and could result in substantial costs, including compliance costs, retrofit costs and construction costs,
monitoring and reporting costs, capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and other new equipment
and increased energy costs. We cannot predict how future laws and regulations, or future interpretations of
current laws and regulations, related to climate change will affect our business, results of operations, liquidity
and financial condition. Our reputation could be negatively affected if we violate climate change laws or
regulations.

**_We collect and process personal data in our daily business, and the leakage of such data may violate law and_**
**_could adversely affect our business._**

We collect, store and use personal data in the ordinary course of our business operations. We are therefore
subject to data protection legislation (including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) (the

44


-----

“GDPR”)). The GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018, and was immediately binding across all
Member States of the European Union, is a privacy regime regarding the protection of natural persons in relation
to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data. The GDPR obligates European Unionbased companies or companies that process personal data about European Union subjects (either as “data
controllers” or as “data processors”) to comply with a large number of obligations, which relate, for example, to
(i) the processing of personal data including transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation,
security and confidentiality, (ii) the ability of the controller to demonstrate compliance with such principles
(accountability), (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis before the processing and (iv) the rights of data
subjects, such as, among others, transparency, a right of access, the right to rectification and the right to erasure.
The GDPR obligates companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document
the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies or types of
data. We work to continue to be fully compliant with our obligations under the GDPR and have engaged an
external data protection officer who, among other things, advises on our compliance obligations and assists us in
ensuring that our software systems safely process personal data, which mainly relates to our employees.

Non-compliance with the GDPR may be met with significant penalties, including fines of up to 4% of total
annual worldwide turnover or €20 million (whichever is higher), depending on the type and severity of the
breach. The fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures that may be ordered by supervisory
authorities (such as the request to cease processing). Non-compliance or technical defects resulting in a leak or
the misuse of such data could also result in damage to our reputation and otherwise harm our business. In
addition, we do not currently have specific data security insurance coverage and we cannot guarantee that our
general liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all or any liabilities in the event of a breach of our
data security systems. Should one or more of these risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Interruptions in operations at our production facilities could result in unexpected supply shortages and_**
**_disruptions of the supply chain which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

We operate five wood panel production facilities in Germany and one resin production facility in Poland,
and our results of operations are dependent on the continued operation of such plants and the ability to complete
construction and maintenance projects on schedule. If one or more of our production facilities were to be
disrupted or inoperative for an unplanned period of time, we could have difficulty maintaining a sufficient level
of production to meet customer requirements. Furthermore, we could incur significant costs due to measures we
would need to take to mitigate the effects of an inoperative production facility, such as higher transportation costs
if we needed to ship products from production facilities in other regions. Any such disruptions could also cause
our customers to perceive that we are not able to deliver our products reliably, which could result in a loss of
customers.

Our production processes and technologies are complex as they need to be adapted to variations in the
properties of certain raw materials and use combustibles and other dangerous or flammable materials, such as
resins, formaldehyde and glues as well as large quantities of wood in production processes that produce
significant heat. The significant amounts of heat involved in our production processes (particularly when
combined with raw materials such as wood, resin and other dry materials like wood dust) and/or technical or
other defects in our equipment, can result in dangerous conditions in our production plants such as fires. Such
conditions could result in significant interruptions in operations at our facilities, for example, due to large fires,
explosions or other accidents, and may significantly reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular
facility, or our business as a whole, during and after such interruptions. For example, our Baruth production
facility caught fire in 2019 as a result of operations by an outdated production system, resulting in us having to
close the facility for a period of approximately two months as we replaced the production system and repaired the
damage caused by the fire. Although we hold several types of insurance policies (including insurance against fire
and business interruptions), our insurance coverage may be insufficient in certain cases. Furthermore, our
insurance coverage may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and our insurance
carriers may not have sufficient funds to cover all potential claims. In addition, equipment failure or defects
could lead to an increase of our overall carbon footprint which may lead to increased costs related to our Scope
1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions or negatively impact our ability to meet our commitment to reduce our Scope
1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions to 201.7 kT by the end of 2022 and to 173.9 kT by the end of 2025, in each
case from our baseline of 220.2 kT in 2020.

45


-----

Interruptions of our operations resulting from supply shortages of certain raw materials or other inputs can
significantly affect our profitability. If any of our suppliers is subject to a major disruption in its production
plants or is unable to meet its obligations under our existing supply agreements, we may not be able to find
acceptable alternative sources or adapt our production processes sufficiently to differing qualities of raw
materials and the process of locating and securing such alternative sources might be disruptive to our business.
Any extended unavailability of a necessary raw material or other input could cause us to cease manufacturing one
or more of our products for a certain period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Higher employment costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of_**
**_operations._**

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,106 full-time equivalent employees (“FTEs”), including
apprentices, in our Engineered Wood Products division and 121 FTEs in our Silekol division, in each case,
including employees that were temporarily furloughed under COVID-19-related measures. For the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, our employee benefits expenses equaled 17.8%, 19.3% and 19.6% of our net
sales, respectively. Labor costs may rise in the future as a result of increased workforce activism, government
decrees and changes in social and pension contribution rules meant to reduce government budget deficits or to
increase welfare benefits to employees. A sustained increase in labor costs may result in some of our facilities
becoming less cost-competitive compared to manufacturers operating from countries with lower salary levels.
Should labor costs increase further, and should we be unable to recover these cost increases from our customers
through increased sales prices or off-set costs through productivity gains, our business, financial condition and
results of operations may be materially adversely affected. If we expand our operations into new jurisdictions, we
may be subject to higher employee benefits expenses in these new jurisdictions relative to our current operating
costs, which could have a negative effect on our profit margin.

Furthermore, most of the countries in which we operate have labor laws which protect the interests of
workers, including statutorily mandated minimum wage increases, legislation that imposes financial obligations
on employers and laws governing the employment of workers. These labor laws in one or more of the key
jurisdictions in which we operate may be modified in the future in a way that is detrimental to our business. Any
increase in the stringency of these labor laws, continued increases in statutory minimum wages, additional
restrictions from works council and increasing labor costs in the jurisdictions in which we operate, may make it
more difficult for us to discharge employees, or cost-effectively downsize our operations, both of which would
likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Labor disruptions could adversely affect our business._**

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,734 FTEs (including employees that were temporarily
furloughed under COVID-19-related measures) in Germany who were subject to regional and internal company
collective bargaining agreements (Tarifverträge), covering most of our employees in our German production
facilities. As a result, we could experience a material labor disruption or strike at one or more of our facilities,
either in the course of the renegotiation of one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future or
otherwise. In addition, while we have entered into framework social plan and reconciliation of interests
agreements with our German group-wide works council in connection with the implementation of our headcount
optimization programs, we cannot exclude that our employees may strike or initiate other labor disputes in
response to already implemented or planned future headcount reductions. While we have not suffered any
material work stoppages or strikes in recent years, a significant interruption of our production processes at our
production plants or other facilities due to strikes or similar industrial action could significantly reduce the
productivity and profitability of particular facilities, or our business as a whole, which could have material
adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are dependent on qualified personnel in key positions and employees having special technical knowledge._**

Qualified and motivated personnel are one of the key factors in the further development of our business, in
particular our further technological development and geographic expansion. There is a risk that we may not be
able to attract key personnel to fill vacancies or that we may fail to retain key employees. Personnel shortages
and the loss of key employees could negatively influence our further business development. In addition, there are
risks related to our dependence on individual persons in key positions, particularly at the level of the managing
board as well as in the areas of development, distribution, service, production, finance and marketing. The loss of
management personnel or employees in key positions would lead to a loss of know-how, or under certain

46


-----

circumstances, to the passing on of this know-how to our competitors. If one or more of these risks materialize,
this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We have obligations to our employees relating to retirement and other obligations, the calculations of which_**
**_are based on a number of assumptions, including discount rates and life expectancies, which may differ from_**
**_actual rates in the future._**

We operate unfunded defined-benefit pension schemes for beneficiaries under arrangements that have been
established in Germany. As of December 31, 2020, we had total employee benefit obligations of €54.3 million,
which were entirely unfunded. Our defined benefit obligations are based on certain actuarial and underlying
assumptions that can vary by country, including discount rates, life expectancies and rates of increase in
compensation levels. If actual results, especially discount rates or life expectancies were to differ from our
underlying and actuarial assumptions, our pension obligations could be higher than expected and we could incur
actuarial losses. Changes in all assumptions could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We believe that our brands and our intellectual property rights are important to our ongoing success, and any_**
**_damage, threat to, or impairment of these could harm our business results and reputation and cause us to_**
**_incur costs to defend these rights._**

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated our net sales from products marketed under the
Pfleiderer, Duropal and Thermopal brands, in the case of our Engineered Wood Products division, and Silekol,
Melfemo, Melpap, Silepap and Melkol, in the case of our Silekol products. We believe that the brand awareness,
preference and loyalty that some professional and end-user customers exhibit for these brands in many markets in
which we operate are an important competitive advantage. The maintenance and protection of our Pfleiderer,
Duropal and Thermopal brands are therefore important for our future success. If we are unable to protect and
promote our brands effectively, our brands might not continue to be recognized by our relevant customer groups
for their high quality and advanced technical standards. This could have a material adverse effect on our
reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

As a company that manufactures and markets branded products, we rely on trademark protection to protect
our brands. We own several registered trademarks worldwide and we also have obtained and applied for patents
for certain of our technologies which are protected in several countries, utility models and registered designs
worldwide. These protections may not adequately safeguard our intellectual property, which may adversely affect
our results of operations. There is a risk that third parties, including our current competitors, will infringe on our
intellectual property rights, in which case we would have to defend these rights. There is also a risk that third
parties, including our current competitors, will claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property
rights and bring infringement claims against us or our customers. We may incur significant costs to defend our
intellectual property rights, which may have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition, results of
operations, our customer relationships and our reputation.

Further, protection of our processes and other technology is important to our business. We rely upon
unpatented proprietary expertise, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and
maintain our competitive position. In addition to protecting our intellectual property through patents, trademarks,
utility models and registered designs, we also enter into confidentiality agreements with third-party developers.
We cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will not be breached, or that adequate remedies will be
available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of these trade secrets or proprietary know-how.
Moreover, the laws of certain countries in which we sell our products do not protect intellectual property rights to
the same extent as the laws of Germany or other Western European countries. Furthermore, the maintenance of
the full range of patent, trademark, utility model and registered design protection available in all relevant
jurisdictions is cost-prohibitive. As a result, we may not be able to prevent others from copying our products or
from using our intellectual property. The failure of our intellectual property rights or confidentiality agreements
to protect our processes, technology, designs, trade secrets or proprietary know-how could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We depend on efficient and uninterrupted operations of our information and communication technology._**

The operation of our production plants as well as our sales and service activities depends on the efficient
and uninterrupted operation of complex and sophisticated computer, telecommunication and data processing
systems. We currently depend upon numerous local and several regionally integrated information systems to

47


-----

process orders, respond to customer inquiries, manage inventory, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis,
maintain cost-efficient operations, prepare financial information and reports, and operate our website. We
continually review our information system options to help strengthen common business practices, improve
operational efficiency, reduce risk and drive cost savings.

Computer and data processing systems and related information technology infrastructure (data center,
hardware and wide and local area networks) are generally exposed to the risk of disturbances, damage, electricity
failures, computer viruses, fire, other disasters, hacker attacks and similar events. While we have a
comprehensive security program that is continuously reviewed and upgraded, we may experience operating
problems with our information systems as a result of system security failures such as viruses, cyber-attacks,
breaches or other causes. Disruptions to our operations caused by our IT systems, including failures, accidents or
security breaches may occur in the future and have occurred in individual cases in the past. Any significant
disruption or slowdown of our current or future information systems as a result of a system security failure could
disrupt the flow of operational information, cause orders to be lost or delayed and could damage our reputation
with our customers or cause our customers to cancel orders, any of which could adversely affect our financial
results.

Our IT systems capture a large amount of customer data, and theft of sensitive data and our inability to
protect trade secrets and personal identifiable information of our employees, customers or suppliers could have
an adverse effect on our business, customers, suppliers and employees. Although administration and production
networks are separated, an interruption in the operations of computer or data processing systems could adversely
affect our ability to efficiently maintain our production processes and to ensure adequate controls. Disruptions to
or interruptions in operations could lead to production downtime which, in turn, could result in lost sales. We
also depend on the hosting company’s infrastructure and any interruption, disruption or security breaches at the
hosting company’s data center may have an adverse effect on our operations. If one or more of these risks
materializes, this could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may incur material costs as a result of warranty and product liability claims which could adversely affect_**
**_our profitability._**

Our products are subject to express and implied warranty claims. In the past, we have been subject to
product liability claims and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining or reducing the
historical level of warranty claims or that claims in relation to our products will not increase significantly.
Additionally, defects in our products may result in product liability claims, product recalls, adverse customer
reaction and negative publicity about us or our products. Our production processes also operate at high
temperatures and use significant pressure, and accordingly, any failures could result in substantial harm to people
or property. While we hold insurance for product liability matters we cannot assure you that such insurance will
cover any such matter, or that such insurance will continue to be available on economically reasonable terms, if
at all. We currently have systems in place based on ISO 9001 aimed at monitoring quality measures, controlling
quality and reacting to risks that may be found. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to address
all risks that are discovered, and usually, hidden defects in our products appear only after they have been utilized
by our customers. For example, we recently became aware of bug infections that affected several kitchens built
using our BalanceBoard products that contain popcorn wood, which is attractive to certain types of beetles. We
believe that all infections occurred either at our customers’ storage facilities or directly in the assembled
kitchens; however, we decided to discontinue our BlanceBoard products with effect from the end of 2021. While
to date we have settled various out-of-court claims from customers in this respect, we may become subject to
product liability claims, which may not be fully covered under our insurance policies. In addition, this and other
defects may require expensive modifications to our products and may adversely affect our reputation. The
occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the risks we may face and if we were no longer_**
**_covered by our existing insurance, it may be difficult to obtain replacement insurance on acceptable terms or_**
**_at all._**

Although we maintain insurance policies, including fire, explosion, radiation, electrical damage, fuel or
power shortages, third-party liability insurance, transport insurance, computer insurance and directors’ and
officers’ insurance, not all risks are insured or insurable (and may have significant deductibles on policies).
Accordingly, our insurance policies do not provide coverage for all losses related to our business, and the
occurrence of losses, liabilities or damage not covered by such insurance policies could have a material adverse

48


-----

effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Due to variable insurance market conditions,
there can be no assurance that the insurance that we carry will continue to be available, will be available at
economically acceptable premiums or will be adequate to cover any resulting liability, and we may be required to
pay high deductibles. In some cases, coverage is not available or is considered too expensive relative to the
perceived risk. For example, in 2020, we raised the deductible from €2.5 million to €5.0 million for our property
and business interruption coverage relating to our properties and, partly as a result of the 2019 fire at our Baruth
facility which increased our premium, terminated coverage relating to our machinery for breakdowns and loss of
profit. If we experience a loss in the future, the proceeds of the applicable insurance policies, if any, may not be
adequate to cover replacement costs, lost revenue, increased expenses and/or liabilities to third parties. In
addition, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, many credit insurers have decreased the level of coverage
they provide. If the insurance coverage provided by credit insurers continues to decrease in connection of the
COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, our insurance terms, including those that are currently favorable to us, may
be revised. Any of the foregoing risks, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to risks from legal proceedings._**

We are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business and could become involved in additional
legal and arbitration disputes in the future which may involve substantial claims for damages or other payments,
including damage claims by customers in connection with past or future violations of antitrust laws. The outcome
of the currently pending or potential future proceedings is difficult to predict with any certainty. In the event of a
negative outcome of any material legal or arbitration proceeding, whether based on a judgment or a settlement
agreement, we could be obligated to make substantial payments. In addition, the costs related to litigation and
arbitration proceedings may be significant. The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For a summary of certain legal and
regulatory proceedings in which we are currently involved, see “Business—Legal and Regulatory Proceedings.”

**_We are subject to certain competition and antitrust laws._**

Our business is subject to applicable competition and antitrust laws, rules and regulations. In general, these
laws are designed to preserve free and open competition in the marketplace in order to enhance competitiveness
and economic efficiency. While we believe we are generally in compliance with all applicable competition and
antitrust laws, rules and regulations and are taking measures to be compliant with these laws, rules and
regulations in the future, we have in the past and may in the future become subject to investigations and
proceedings by national and supranational competition and antitrust authorities for alleged infringements of
competition or antitrust laws. For instance, we have previously been fined by the German Federal Cartel Office
for price collusion in the wood raw material products industry and are currently also party to two proceedings
filed by affected customers seeking damages. See “Business—Legal and Regulatory Proceedings.”

The realization of any risks related to competition and antitrust laws and violations thereof could have a
material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our risk management and internal controls may not prevent or detect violations of law._**

Our existing compliance processes and controls may not be sufficient in order to prevent or detect
inadequate practices, fraud and violations of law by our intermediaries, sales agents and employees. Due to our
business practices, we are subject to a number of laws and regulations in various countries. These include, among
others, regulations concerning competition and antitrust law, international trade and customs, licensing and
permits, commercial intellectual property and its enforcement, warranty and product liability, environmental,
building and zoning law, energy law, hazardous substances and chemicals law, labor and work protection law,
tax law and regulations related to purchasing and acquisitions.

In the case that any intermediaries, consultants, sales agents or employees with whom we cooperate either
receive or grant inappropriate benefits or generally use corrupt, fraudulent or other unfair business practices, we
could be confronted with legal sanctions, penalties and loss of orders and harm to our reputation. Especially
given our multinational profile, complex group structure, size and the extent of our cooperation with
intermediaries, consultants and sales agents, our internal controls and procedures, policies and our risk
management may not be adequate, which could have a material negative impact on our reputation, business
activities, financial position and results of operations.

49


-----

**_We have to rely on a compliance system to prevent irregularities in business activities, and failure to comply_**
**_with anti-corruption and regulations and economic sanctions programs could result in fines and criminal_**
**_penalties and have an adverse effect on our business._**

We are subject to the risk that we, our affiliated entities or our or their respective officers, directors,
employees or agents may take action determined to be in violation of anti-corruption laws, including the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and others. Our employees may be tempted
to win business with illegal practices, in particular corruption, certain sales incentives or violation of antitrust
laws. In addition, we are required to comply with various economic sanctions programs, including those
administered by the United Nations Security Council and the United States, including the Office of Foreign
Assets Control (“OFAC”). These programs restrict us from conducting certain transactions or dealings involving
certain sanctioned countries or persons.

Although we have internal policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable anticorruption laws and sanctions regulations, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be
sufficient or that our employees, directors, officers, partners, agents or service providers will not take actions in
violation of our policies and procedures (or otherwise in violation of the relevant anti-corruption laws and
sanctions regulations) for which they or we may ultimately be held responsible. Violations of anti-corruption
laws and sanctions regulations could lead to financial penalties being imposed on us, limits being placed on our
activities, authorizations or licenses being revoked, damage to our reputation and other consequences that could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore,
detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time
and attention of our senior management. In addition, litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected
violations of anti-corruption laws or sanctions regulations could be costly. Any of the foregoing could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to risks related to conducting operations in many different countries._**

Due to the international scope of our business operations, we are subject to risks related to the differing
legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent
in international operations include the following:

   - general economic, social or political conditions in the countries in which we operate;

   - compliance with a variety of laws and regulations in various jurisdictions may be burdensome;

   - inconsistent regulations, licensing and legal requirements may increase our cost of operations as we
endeavor to comply with a myriad of laws that differ from one country to another in an unpredictable
and adverse manner;

   - withholding taxes or other taxes or royalties on our income could be imposed or other restrictions on
foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls, could be adopted;

   - adverse changes in export duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses could
occur;

   - expropriation or other confiscation of our products or other assets, including in connection with
customs controls;

   - difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights;

   - increase in transportation and other shipping costs;

   - the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates, including devaluations of local currencies or our
functional currency that may make our products uncompetitive for current and potential customers;

   - differences in consumer preferences in products;

   - imposition of price controls;

   - terrorist attacks and natural disasters and epidemics; and

   - difficulty in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables.

Any of these and other factors could require us to change our current operational structure and could have a
material adverse impact on our results of operations.

50


-----

Moreover, certain countries in which we operate have different business practices and in some cases
considerably lower levels of economic, political and legal stability as compared to Western Europe. This is
particularly true of countries in Southeastern Europe, which we have specifically identified as a growth market
for our products. Some of the countries in this region have a history of political and economic crises. Any
deterioration of the underlying conditions in such countries may have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Legal, political and economic uncertainty surrounding the recent exit of the United Kingdom from the_**
**_European Union may continue to adversely impact current trading arrangements, be a source of instability in_**
**_international markets and create significant currency fluctuations, which could have a material adverse effect_**
**_on our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

In the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 7% of our consolidated gross sale from the sale of
products to customers located in the United Kingdom. Following the outcome of a referendum on EU
membership, on March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom formally notified the European Council of its intention to
leave the European Union (“Brexit”), and on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom left the European Union on
the basis of a previously negotiated withdrawal agreement, which was adopted by the UK parliament on
January 24, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the European Union and United Kingdom announced that they had
reached a comprehensive, zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade agreement in principle with the European Union (the
“EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement”). On December 31, 2020, the UK implemented the EU-UK Trade
and Cooperation Agreement, which entered into force provisionally on January 1, 2021. Despite the
implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the end of the transition period on that date
has, among other things, led to increased customs and health and safety checks at the border, which has delayed
and disrupted the movement of goods between the EU and the United Kingdom and may undermine bilateral
cooperation in key policy areas, significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the EU and cause
political and economic instability in other countries of the European Union.

Due to the size and importance of the United Kingdom’s economy, the uncertainty and unpredictability
concerning the United Kingdom’s legal, political and economic relationship with Europe after Brexit may
continue to be a source of instability in the international markets, create significant currency fluctuations, and/or
otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar cross-border cooperation arrangements (whether
economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise) for the foreseeable future.

In particular, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about whether the terms of the
relationship between the United Kingdom and European Union under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation
Agreement will differ materially in practice from the past. Lack of clarity about future laws and regulations in the
United Kingdom as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate could
depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital. The economic outlook could be further adversely
affected by, among other things: (i) the risk arising from changes in laws and regulations in the U.K.; (ii) the risk
that movements in the U.K. pound exchange rates related to Brexit could damage competitiveness or
profitability; (iii) the risk that goods moving between the U.K. and any member of the EU may be subject to
duties and tariffs; and (iv) the risk that goods moving between the U.K. and any member of the EU will be
subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and
departure. Any disruptions at English ports such as Dover and Immingham, resulting in delays and supply
disruptions, could have a material adverse impact on our exports to the United Kingdom. Changes to the trading
relationship between the U.K. and the EU are expected to result in increased cost of goods imported into and
exported from the U.K. If tariff rates are levied on our exports from the European Union to the United Kingdom
and customs-related costs increase, we may face additional costs in our operations. Our results of operations may
also be impacted if we lose our import or local transport permits or if our end-market customers experience
additional costs in exporting goods to the United Kingdom.

As a result, the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial position and results of operations.

**_We may pursue further growth organically or through acquisitions or new joint ventures which, if_**
**_consummated, could increase the level of our indebtedness and may adversely affect our business if we cannot_**
**_effectively integrate these new operations._**

While we currently do not have plans to pursue acquisitions or new joint ventures in the near to mediumterm, we may in the future engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions of businesses and new joint

51


-----

ventures that we believe will present opportunities to realize synergies and strengthen our market position. If we
consummate any such transaction, our capitalization and results of operations could change significantly. In
addition, any acquisition or new joint venture we may undertake in the future could result in the incurrence of
debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expenses and amortization expenses related to goodwill
and other intangible assets. Acquisitions and joint ventures involve numerous other risks, including difficulties in
integrating the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and joint ventures,
along with unforeseen liabilities and costs, and the diversion of management’s attention from other business
matters. Our ability to manage the growth and integrate operations, technologies, products and personnel depends
on our administrative, financial and operational controls, our ability to create the infrastructure necessary to
exploit market opportunities for our products and our financial capabilities. In order to compete effectively and to
grow our business profitably, we will need, on a timely basis, to maintain and improve our financial and
management controls, reporting systems and procedures, implement new systems as necessary, attract and retain
adequate management personnel and hire a qualified workforce that we can train and manage. The failure or
delay of our management in responding to these challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to risks associated with the optimization of our corporate structure and our separation from_**
**_the Panel East division._**

Historically, our Parent operated our business through three divisions, Engineered Wood Products, Silekol
and Panel East. Following the take private of our Parent in September 2019, to focus our operations on our core
divisions, our Sponsor separated our Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions from Panel East. We now
operate our Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions together through the Issuer, while Panel East
operates independently and on an arm’s-length basis.

In 2020, we optimized our corporate structure to enhance the credit profile of the Pfleiderer business.
However, we may encounter unanticipated events, costs or delays with respect to the optimization of our
corporate structure. We may be unable to achieve anticipated cost savings, business optimizations and synergies
in a timely manner, if at all. In addition, the optimization of our corporate structure may negatively affect our
end-market and customer diversification, and our ability to meet our customers’ demand or to realize expected
growth or cost savings may be negatively impacted in some cases, and may also increase our exposure to
cyclicality. If one or more of our assumptions underlying our decisions to engage in the optimization of our
corporate structure are incorrect, we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated timeframe, the
expected cost savings, business optimizations or synergies we anticipate. Furthermore, our management will
need to continue to manage the Panel East business for as long as it is owned by Parent, and as a result certain
management members may not be able to focus a sufficient amount of their time on running the Pfleiderer
business. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and
results of operations.

Certain of our subsidiaries are party to various agreements with Panel East, and will continue to receive
management and other services from the Parent, which will not be bound by the covenants set forth in the
Indenture. These agreements may be cancelled, amended or terminated in certain cases, including in some cases
upon a sale of the Panel East business to a third party. Based on our unaudited management accounts, we
estimate that the sale by our Engineered Wood Products division of products manufactured by Panel East under a
Wood Supply and Distribution Agreement, contributed approximately €2.2 million, or 1.9%, to the Adjusted
EBITDA of our Engineered Wood Products division in the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, based on
our unaudited management accounts, we estimate the sale by Panel East of products manufactured by our
Engineered Wood Products division contributed approximately €2.2 million, or 1.9%, to the Adjusted EBITDA
of our Engineered Wood Products division in the year ended December 31, 2020. Following a disposal of Panel
East, the Wood Products Supply and Distribution Agreement would become terminable by either party. Should
the Wood Products Supply and Distribution Agreement be terminated, we may lose all or any portion of the
contribution to our Adjusted EBITDA generated by our transactions with Panel East. In 2020, our Silekol
division and Panel East entered into the Panel East Resin Supply Agreement, pursuant to which Panel East
undertakes to purchase certain fixed quantities of resin and other chemicals from Silekol each year, which
constitute a significant portion of Panel East’s annual resin requirements. In the year ended December 31, 2020,
sales of resins from our Silekol division to Panel East contributed €6.8 million, or 39%, to the Adjusted EBITDA
of our Silekol division. While the Panel East Resin Supply Agreement has an initial term of five years and would
not become terminable upon a sale of Panel East to a third party, there can be no assurance that a potential
purchaser of Panel East would renew the Panel East Resin Supply Agreement on similar commercial terms after
the initial five-year period or at all.

52


-----

Furthermore, our Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions and Panel East have jointly purchased
selected categories of raw materials, such as paper and chemicals, which has allowed us to benefit from certain
procurement cost synergies due to the larger scale purchasing power of the three divisions compared to our
Group. Following a sale of Panel East, if Panel East or a prospective buyer chose to terminate such joint
procurement efforts, we may no longer be able to benefit from such procurement cost synergies. In addition, in
the ordinary course of business, we provide certain corporate and administrative services to Panel East on
standard market terms. As a result of Panel East operating as an independent division outside of the Restricted
Group following the completion of the optimization of our corporate structure, or if sold to a third party, Panel
East may choose to source these services from third parties, which would result in the loss of a portion or all of
the net sales we generate from the provision of such services to Panel East.

**_We may dispose of certain assets in the future, including potentially our Silekol division._**

In the future, from time to time, we may dispose of certain business lines or other assets of Pfleiderer,
including, potentially, our Silekol division. As a result of any such disposal, we may generate lower sales, have a
lower amount of total assets on our statement of financial position and experience changes to our trade working
capital. In the year ended December 31, 2020, our Silekol division generated net sales of €32.1 million from the
sale of resins and other chemicals to our Engineered Wood Products division. As a result of a divestment of our
Silekol division, we could be required to purchase a large portion of our resin and other chemicals from what
would then be a third party, would have to negotiate contract extensions and pricing in the future and could lose
significant insight and expertise in the chemicals and resins market. In addition, we would lose the competitive
advantage of having one of the leading manufacturer of resins in Central and Eastern Europe as our in-house
provider of resins. These disposals may also negatively affect our end-market and customer diversification and
our ability to meet our customers’ demands or to realize expected growth or cost savings, and may also increase
our exposure to cyclicality. Additionally, the disposition of certain assets may also reduce the Collateral securing
the Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility. Furthermore, under certain circumstances (including with
respect to the Silekol division upon meeting a net leverage ratio), the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement will allow us to dividend certain assets or the proceeds from the sale of certain assets to our
shareholders without first reducing the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, the New Revolving Credit
Facility or other indebtedness of Pfleiderer.

**_Currency rate and interest rate fluctuations might adversely affect our financial position and results of_**
**_operations._**

We conduct part of our business outside the euro zone and are therefore subject to the risks of exchange rate
fluctuations, including in connection with transaction risks and translation risks.

The functional currency of the Issuer is the euro and, as a result, the Consolidated Financial Statements are
presented in euro. The functional currency of our subsidiaries, including those in Poland, is their respective local
currency. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is minimal and relate mainly to sales in Poland.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of our foreign assets, net sales, liabilities
and cost when reported in euro and, therefore, our financial condition and results of operations. Based on our
sales denominated in Polish zloty for the year ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that a hypothetical 5%
change in the exchange rate of a foreign currency versus the euro and the Polish zloty, could have the net effect
of reducing or increasing our profit/(loss) before tax for the year ended December 31, 2020 by approximately
€0.3 million. Therefore, if the euro appreciates, in particular in relation to the Polish zloty, and our net sales and
expenses denominated in foreign currencies remain the same, or, in some cases, even if our net sales increases or
our expenses decrease, our net sales and profits in euro will decline. As a result of our liquidity planning and
ongoing review of foreign exchange risks, we may enter into hedges against a depreciation of the Polish zloty
against the euro in the future. While our hedging strategy may enable us to partly mitigate the effects on our cash
flows of an appreciation of the value of the euro compared to the Polish zloty over a period of up to one year, it
does not enable us to mitigate the risk of a long-term appreciation. In addition, should exchange rates move in a
direction different from that anticipated by us, our hedging arrangements can result in opportunity losses that
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Changes in accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or assumptions in the application of accounting_**
**_policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations._**

The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. New
accounting standards or pronouncements that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the

53


-----

interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements, could have a significant effect on our reported results of
operations for the affected periods.

In addition, some accounting policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the
reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require
management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If
those assumptions, estimates or judgments were incorrectly made, we could be required to correct and restate
prior period financial statements, and there can be no assurances that we will make the correct judgments in the
future, should any new standards be issued. Accounting standard-setters and those who interpret the accounting
standards may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards
should be applied. Any of these changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and
report our financial condition and results of operations, which could have a significant impact on our future
financial statements.

**_We are subject to complex tax laws, and changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely_**
**_affect our results of operations and financial condition._**

Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax positions, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. We
often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. We cannot be certain that
the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are
challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we
currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect such taxes, which could
increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, operating results
and cash flows.

**_Pending and future tax audits and changes in fiscal regulations could lead to additional tax liabilities or_**
**_increases in our effective tax rate._**

We operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and file our tax returns in compliance with the tax laws and
regulations of those jurisdictions. Various factors determine our effective tax rate, including changes in or
interpretations of tax laws and regulations by the courts or tax authorities in any given jurisdiction, global- and
EU-based tax policy initiatives which aim among other things to address tax avoidance by multinational
companies, changes in geographical allocation of income and expense, our ability to use net operating loss or
other tax attributes, and our evaluation of deferred tax assets. Changes to our effective tax rate could have a
substantial negative impact on our business, financial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.
Also, due to the size and nature of our business, we are subject to ongoing reviews by tax authorities on various
tax matters, including challenges to positions we assert on our tax returns. We accrue tax liabilities and tax
contingencies based upon our best estimate of the taxes ultimately expected to be paid. Such amounts are
included in taxes payable, other non-current liabilities or deferred tax liabilities, as appropriate, and updated over
time as more information becomes available or on the basis of the lapse of the statute of limitation. We are
routinely subject to audit and review in a number of jurisdictions in which we operate, and further audits may
commence in the future.

Our business activity is assessed for tax purposes based on currently applicable tax legislation taking into
account current case law and administrative interpretations. There may be uncertainties, however, regarding the
tax treatment of specific transactions and we may contest taxes assessed against us. As a result, there can be no
assurance that our current and future position on taxation matters will be accepted by the relevant tax authorities.
Such uncertainties in the applicable tax legislation or case law, as well as any changes in interpretation by the tax
authorities, could have a material adverse effect on our net assets, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to routine tax audits by local tax authorities. In Germany, for example, tax audits for
corporate income tax (Körperschaftsteuer), trade tax (Gewerbesteuer) and VAT (Umsatzsteuer) relating to the
periods from the year ended December 31, 2010, up to and including the year ended December 31, 2015, were
completed in 2018.

Tax audits for later periods not yet subject to a tax audit or tax audits in other countries may lead to higher
tax assessments in the future. For example, we operate a number of tax groups (Organschaften) in Germany and
we are therefore exposed to the risk of a challenge of the existence and due operation of tax groups in the course
of future tax audits. A non-recognition of our tax groups could lead to additional tax liabilities. Any additional
tax payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may need to write down goodwill and brands, which would adversely affect our financial results._**

As of December 31, 2020, 2.6% of our total assets were intangible assets, with 8.7% of our total assets
corresponding to goodwill. Goodwill is recognized as an intangible asset and is subject to an impairment test, at
least annually or upon the occurrence of significant events or changes in circumstances that indicate an
impairment has occurred. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not recognize goodwill or brand
impairment losses. An adverse development in our business activities may require us to recognize additional
significant impairment charges and write off all or a substantial part of the carrying amount of our goodwill and
brands. A write-off of all or a part of our goodwill and brands would adversely affect our financial results.

**Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure**

**_The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors seeking exposure to assets with sustainability_**
**_characteristics_**

In connection with the Offering, we adopted the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework, which was
reviewed by ISS Corporate Solutions, who provided the Second Party Opinion. The Second Party Opinion may
not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors that may affect
the value of the Notes. The Second Party Opinion does not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities and is only current as of the date it is released. A withdrawal of the Second Party Opinion may affect
the value of the Notes and/or may have consequences for certain investors with portfolio mandates to invest in
sustainability-linked assets. We do not assume any obligation or responsibility to release any update or revision
to the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework and/or information to reflect events or circumstances after the
date of publication of such Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework and, therefore, an update or a revision of
the Second Party Opinion may or may not be requested to ISS Corporate Solutions or other providers of secondparty opinions.

Moreover, the Second Party Opinion provider and providers of similar opinions and certifications are not
currently subject to any specific regulatory or other regime or oversight. Any such opinion or certification is not,
nor should be deemed to be, a recommendation by the Issuer, the Guarantors or any member of the Group, the
Initial Purchasers, any second party opinion providers, the External Reviewer or any other person to buy, sell or
hold the Notes. Noteholders have no recourse against the Issuer, the Guarantors, any of the Initial Purchasers or
the provider of any such opinion or certification for the contents of any such opinion or certification, which is
only current as at the date it was initially issued. Prospective investors must determine for themselves the
relevance of any such opinion or certification and/or the information contained therein and/or the provider of
such opinion or certification for the purpose of any investment in the Notes. Any withdrawal of any such opinion
or certification or any such opinion or certification attesting that we are not complying in whole or in part with
any matters for which such opinion or certification is opining on or certifying on may have a material adverse
effect on the value of the Notes and/or result in adverse consequences for certain investors with portfolio
mandates to invest in securities to be used for a particular purpose.

Furthermore, although the interest rate relating to the Notes is subject to upward adjustment in certain
circumstances specified in “—Description of the Notes”, such Notes may not satisfy an investor’s requirements
or any future legal or quasi legal standards for investment in assets with sustainability characteristics. The Notes
are not being marketed as green bonds since we expect to use the relevant net proceeds to fully repay the Existing
Term Loan, including accrued interest, grant a loan to the Parent so that the Parent may make a distribution to
our Sponsor, and pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. Therefore, we not intend to
allocate the net proceeds specifically to projects or business activities meeting environmental or sustainability
criteria, or be subject to any other limitations associated with green bonds.

In addition, the interest rate adjustment in respect of the Notes depends on a definition of Percentage of
Recycled Wood Used and Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions that may be inconsistent with investor
requirements or expectations or other definitions relevant to recycled wood and/or greenhouse emissions. If no
Second Party Opinion is obtained, there might be no third-party analysis of its definition of Percentage of
Recycled Wood Used or Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions or how such definitions relate to any
sustainability-related standards other than the relevant External Reviewer’s confirmation of the Percentage of
Recycled Wood Used in our products and the amount of Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions produced as of
December 31, 2022 and 2025, each according to our definition thereof. Even though we have obtained the
Second Party Opinion, there currently is no clearly-defined definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor
market consensus as to, what constitutes a “sustainable” or “sustainability-linked” or equivalently-labelled
project or as to what precise attributes are required for a particular project to be defined as “sustainable” or

55


-----

“sustainability-linked” (and, in addition, the requirements of any such label may evolve from time to time). As a
result, no assurance is or can be given to investors by the Issuer, the Guarantors, any other member of the Group,
the Initial Purchasers, any second party opinion providers or the External Reviewer that the Notes will meet any
or all investor expectations or our targets qualifying as “sustainable” or “sustainability-linked” or that any
adverse other impacts will not occur in connection with our striving to achieve such targets. Investors should
make their own assessment as to the suitability or reliability for any purpose whatsoever of any opinion, report or
certification of any third party in connection with the offering of the Notes.

Although we have committed (i) to increase the Percentage of Recycled Wood Used in our operations to at
least 44% by the end of 2022 and 50% by the end of 2025, in each case from approximately 40% in 2020; and
(ii) reduce our Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions to 201.7 kT by the end of 2022 and to 173.9 kT by the
end of 2025, in each case from 220.2 kT in 2020, there can be no assurance of the extent to which we will be
successful in doing so. In addition, there can be no assurance that any future investments we make in furtherance
of these targets will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding
sustainability performance, in particular with regard to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability or
social impact. Adverse environmental or social impacts may occur during the design, construction and operation
of any investments that we make in furtherance of our targets.

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees._**

Following the issuance of the Notes, we will be highly leveraged. We cannot guarantee that we will be able
to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations on an ongoing basis. As of
December 31, 2020, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had €773.0 million of outstanding
indebtedness, comprising the Notes and certain lease obligations. In addition, we will have €65.0 million of
available borrowing under the New Revolving Credit Facility.

The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

   - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

   - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic
and industry conditions;

   - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow, and
limiting the ability

   - to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditure, acquisitions, joint ventures
or other general corporate purposes;

   - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

   - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as
highly leveraged; and

   - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our debt obligations, including the Notes.

Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur more debt under the Indenture, which could
further exacerbate the risks described above. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that with respect to a
distressed disposal of, or an enforcement of the security interests over, the Collateral, holders of the Notes will
receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain
hedging obligations and certain other future indebtedness permitted under the Indenture have been repaid in full.
Additionally, we could raise additional debt that could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although
the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions,
and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those
restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements.

56


-----

**_We will be subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and_**
**_capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will restrict, among other things, our
ability to:

   - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

   - create or incur certain liens;

   - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

   - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

   - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

   - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries;

   - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

   - issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

   - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

   - consolidate or merge with other entities or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and
its restricted subsidiaries; and

   - impair the security interests benefiting the holders of the Notes.

These limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future_
operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our
interest.

In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will require us to comply with a financial test
under certain circumstances. Our ability to meet that financial test can be affected by events beyond our control,
and we cannot assure you that we will meet it. A breach of this test could result in a restriction on the ability to
make new drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event of
default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods and other
limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the facilities and
elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, together with
accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain crossdefault or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under
the New Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our
assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other
liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the
Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could enforce against
any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_Despite our current indebtedness and the restrictive covenants under the Indenture and the New Revolving_**
**_Credit Facility Agreement, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of_**
**_debt or make certain restricted payments, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our_**
**_substantial leverage._**

We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture and the
New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness,
these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain
circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be
substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not prevent us from
incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as such term is defined under those agreements.
Moreover, although the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on
our ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends, we will be able to
make substantial restricted payments under certain circumstances. Adding new debt to our and our subsidiaries’
existing debt levels or making restricted payments could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial
leverage described above, including our possible inability to service our debt.

57


-----

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may not_**
**_be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the New
Revolving Credit Facility and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend
on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to the success of our
business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other
factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated revenue growth, cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future debt and
equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including
the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs, including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding
amount under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (if any), which will mature six months prior to the
maturity of the Notes. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations.”_

The commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility can be further increased, assuming we have the
ability to incur such additional debt under the restrictive covenants to be included in the Indenture. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” At the maturity of the Notes
or any other debt that we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital
resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or
restructure our indebtedness.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the New
Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs,
we may be forced to:

   - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure;

   - sell assets;

   - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

   - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes and the New Revolving Credit
Facility, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital-raising
transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot
assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory
terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.

In the absence of adequate operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and
might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The
terms of our debt, including under the Indenture, restrict or will restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets. We
may not be able to consummate certain dispositions or obtain the funds that we could have realized from the
proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions may not be adequate to
meet our debt service obligations then due.

Any failure to make payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes, on a timely basis would likely
result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In
addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes, the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement may limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any
refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous
covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be
no assurance that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of
such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any
of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations.

**_The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its obligations on the_**
**_Notes._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other than
investments in its subsidiaries. As a result, the Issuer depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its

58


-----

subsidiaries to meet its obligations. Pfleiderer intends to provide funds to the Issuer in order to meet the
obligations on the Notes through a combination of dividends and interest payments on intercompany loans.

If our subsidiaries do not fulfill their obligations under the intercompany loans and do not distribute cash to
the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuer will not have any other source of funds that
would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of
these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject such
payments to further taxation. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be
permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In
particular, the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer will generally be limited to the
amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their respective debts when due,
or the amount of intercompany loans available for repayment. Certain subsidiaries of the Issuer are organized
under German law which provides that dividends may only be distributed out of current profits and distributable
reserves, and, generally, interim dividend contributions are not allowed under German law. In addition, those
subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to
any of the Notes.

The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that,
even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet such group’s obligations, they may
not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in their
restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.

**_The Floating Rate Notes and drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at floating_**
**_rates that could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

A significant portion of our debt, including the Floating Rate Notes and drawings under the New Revolving
Credit Facility, will bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR or LIBOR (as the
case may be), as adjusted periodically, plus a margin, and we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations in
interest rates. Fluctuations in EURIBOR or LIBOR, or the occurrence of a “market disruption event” (as will be
defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) may increase our overall interest burden and could
have a material adverse effect on our ability to service our debt obligations. These interest rates could rise
significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow
available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Floating Rate Notes. Neither
the Indenture nor the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all
or any portion of our floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can
be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms.
Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to
terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent that interest rates or any drawings were to increase
significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow.

**_The Use of LIBOR and/or EURIBOR as benchmark may be discontinued in the future_**

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law
enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into
whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of EURIBOR or LIBOR may have been
manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other
interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing
national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial
Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial
instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force
on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of
benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could
be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on
March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced the future cessation or loss of
representativeness of the LIBOR benchmark rates (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement
indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021, in
respect of some currencies and tenors, and after certain later dates for other currencies and tenors. This proposed

59


-----

elimination of the LIBOR benchmark and possible future announcements in respect of any other benchmark,
changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies
could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an
adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, including the need to adopt a
replacement benchmark, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the
Floating Rate Notes and drawing under the New Revolving Credit Facility). Any such change, as well as
manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported
EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at
floating rates of interest, including the Floating Rate Notes and drawings under the New Revolving Credit
Facility.

Furthermore, the Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if EURIBOR is no longer being calculated
or administered, the Issuer could cause an independent financial advisor to determine an appropriate rate, which
means interest on the Floating Rate Notes would be determined on the basis of a benchmark rate not
contemplated at the time you purchased the Floating Rate Notes issued on the Issue Date.

In addition, the development of alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR may result in our floating rate debt
(including our Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes) performing differently than would
otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR had not developed.

The Indenture may require the exercise of discretion by the Issuer and the making of potentially subjective
judgments (including as to whether EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered and as to whether
any alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market usage for the purposes of determining floating
rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities) which may trigger amendments to the Indenture
without the consent of the holders of the Notes. The interests of the Issuer in making such determinations or
amendments may be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes.

In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the
involvement of an independent financial institution, the Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not operate as
intended at the relevant time. If EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our
floating rate debt (including our Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes) will be determined for
the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt.

**_We may enter into hedging agreements, and such hedging agreements may expose us to credit default risks_**
**_and potential losses if our hedging counterparties fall into bankruptcy._**

A significant portion of our debt, including the Notes and drawings under the New Revolving Credit
Facility, will bear interest at floating rates. We may enter in the future into interest hedging agreements to hedge
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Under any such agreements, we would be exposed to credit risks of
our counterparties. If one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we may have under such
swap agreements or other hedging arrangements may become worthless. Also, such hedging activities may be
ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from interest rate
fluctuations. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate hedging agreements, we
may be required to make termination payments, which would result in a loss.

**_Creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the New_**
**_Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred_**
**_on a priority basis under the Indenture are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any_**
**_enforcement sale in priority to the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not control decisions regarding the_**
**_Collateral in certain circumstances._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured initially on a first-priority basis by the same Collateral
securing the obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, under the terms of the
Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be
secured by the same Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes and, in certain circumstances, receive
proceeds from enforcement of Collateral prior to the Notes. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will
permit currency and interest rate hedging and certain other indebtedness incurred in accordance with the
Indenture to be secured on a priority basis.

In the event of enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement,
creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the

60


-----

New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and any other indebtedness permitted to be incurred
on a priority basis under the Indenture will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any
enforcement sale in priority to the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, holders of the
Notes may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then outstanding claims under Super Senior Liabilities
(as defined in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) are greater than the
proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral will, after all obligations under Super
Senior Liabilities have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and
any other obligations secured by the Collateral that are permitted to rank pari passu and are secured on a pari
_passu basis with the Notes. As a result, proceeds from the sale of Collateral in connection with any enforcement_
action may be insufficient to pay claims under the Notes. In addition, claims of our secured creditors that are
secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims
of holders of the Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who will serve as the Security Agent
for the secured parties with respect to the Collateral, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless otherwise instructed by the Instructing
Group (as defined in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) for the
purpose of enforcement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and
_“Description of the Notes—Security.”_

Creditors of Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the
Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the
Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets
of such entities securing such Notes and Notes Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of_
_Liens.”_

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured by first-priority security interests in the Collateral
described in this offering memorandum, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and may secure certain hedging obligations. We may increase the amounts available
under the New Revolving Credit Facility or incur additional Super Senior Liabilities permitted under the
Indenture, as a result of which the amount that will benefit from “super priority” first-priority security interests in
the Collateral may be increased up to the amount permitted under the Indenture. The Collateral may also secure
additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Notes to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any
increase in the debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral.

If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the Collateral.
There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its
obligations under the Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect
to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes.

No appraisal of the fair market value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the Transactions.
The fair market value of the Collateral is based on certain assumptions and may be subject to fluctuations based
on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions, industry conditions and similar factors. The
amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among
others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are
located and the availability of buyers, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily
liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and condition of the Collateral. Furthermore, there may not be
any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of
our assets in the event of an enforcement action. As a result, the book value of the Collateral should not be
conclusively relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets following the occurrence of an event of
default or enforcement event under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such
a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our liquidation. In addition, the value of this

61


-----

Collateral may fluctuate over time and the security granted over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that
entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.

To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by
the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property
subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and
the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that
Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and
the Notes Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would
have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and (if the relevant guarantee has not been released) the
Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the
intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of
the Collateral.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and
other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other
creditors that have the benefit of security interests in the Collateral from time to time. The existence of any such
exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such
Collateral. Furthermore, the first priority ranking of security interests with respect to the Notes can be affected by
a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or
re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with
the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by
means of a public auction or a private sale, may be subject to certain specific requirements and the Security
Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that
the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any
third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security
Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly
decrease. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests” for
further information.

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of_**
**_permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening periods._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may create hardening
periods for such security interests, including, for instance, in Germany and Poland. The granting of shared
security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen
such hardening periods in particular, because the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security
granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future
indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each
new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated.

Each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the
respective hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. If
the grantor of such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding-up proceeding after the
Issue Date, any mortgage or security interest in the Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater
risk than security interests in place on the Issue Date of being voided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver,
liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference under insolvency
law. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of
the security interest. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security
_Interests.”_

The same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection with
the accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their
relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes.

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority
retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security, as applicable.
The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we
fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. In addition, applicable law requires
that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property,
equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly following the time
such property and rights are acquired and identified.

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in
the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a
security interest in the same Collateral and some security interests do not actually create the purported security
interest if not properly perfected. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security
provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by
the security provider in favor of the security taken over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the
debtor. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is sometimes determined by the date on which they became
enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which
came into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) may
have priority. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent has any obligation or responsibility to monitor the
acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps or actions
to perfect or ensure the perfection of, any security interest in the Notes against third parties. The failure to create
or perfect such additional security interests may adversely affect the relevant security interest and/or the priority
of such security interest in favor of the Notes. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the Security Interests” for further information._

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders_**
**_of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local_**
**_law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the
relevant Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent, which will hold the Collateral for the
lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and our hedging obligations, the holders of the Notes and the
holders of any additional debt secured by Collateral permitted to be incurred under the Indenture. The Indenture
will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the
Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not
be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee,
who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the
Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the Security Interests” for further information._

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of_**
**_particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain
exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing
the Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the
Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary
course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of
the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of Notes under which the Collateral securing_**
**_the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Notes Guarantees will_**
**_be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be released
automatically. See “Description of the Notes—Notes Guarantees” and “Description of the Notes—Security—
_Release of Liens.” In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of any of our_

63


-----

subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, then claims
under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be released or transferred. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.” Your_
ability to recover on the Notes could be materially impaired in such circumstances.

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and
retaken in connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Notes, if the Issuer has
confirmed in writing to the Security Agent that it has determined that it is neither possible nor desirable to
implement any such refinancing on terms satisfactory to it by instead granting additional Collateral and/or
amending the terms of the existing Collateral. Such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to the start
of a new “hardening period” in respect of such Collateral. Under certain circumstances, other creditors,
insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant
of such Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of such
Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes.

Furthermore, under German law a secured party is, upon request by the relevant security grantor, obligated
to release security if the realizable value of the security is significantly higher than the value of the obligations
secured by such security. Finally, if the secured obligations are exchanged, novated or terminated, a pledge or
other accessory security interest created pursuant to a Security Document governed by German law might be
released as a matter of German law.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the Issuer’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Some, but not all, of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the Notes. The Issuer and its subsidiaries
that are Guarantors held 99% of the total unconsolidated assets of Pfleiderer as of December 31, 2020, and
generated 80% of the total unconsolidated net sales and 94% of the total unconsolidated EBITDA of Pfleiderer
for the year ended December 31, 2020, in each case, before intercompany eliminations. In addition, as of
December 31, 2020, our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes had no outstanding third-party debt that
would have ranked structurally senior to the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the
Notes Guarantees. Unless a subsidiary of the Issuer is a Guarantor, such subsidiary will not have any obligations
to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. The Indenture will, subject to
some limitations, permit our non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur substantial amounts of additional indebtedness
and will not restrict the amount of other liabilities that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. Generally, holders
of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-Guarantor companies, including lenders under bank financing
agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such non-Guarantor companies before
these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor company becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or
dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

   - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to
proceed against the assets of such company; and

   - the creditors of such non-Guarantor company, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such company before any Guarantor, as
a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each Notes Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including
trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

**_The insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may provide you with less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law_**
**_and enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Notes Guarantees or in the Collateral across_**
**_multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Germany and the Guarantors and security providers are
incorporated under the laws of Germany and Poland. Any insolvency proceedings by or against the Issuer or
Guarantors incorporated or organized in jurisdictions outside of the United States would likely be based on the
insolvency laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the relevant entity (including EU insolvency laws) and not
of the United States. In the event the Issuer or any of the other Guarantors experience financial difficulty, we
cannot predict as to which jurisdiction or jurisdictions may commence insolvency or similar proceedings, or the
outcome of such proceedings. Any enforcement of the Notes Guarantees of the Notes after bankruptcy or an

64


-----

insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s
jurisdiction of incorporation or other jurisdictions. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions
may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with
which you may be familiar. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially
different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the
ability to void preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition
interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into
question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply and may adversely affect your ability to enforce
your rights under the Notes Guarantees in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive. See
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

Security interests to secure the Notes and Notes Guarantees will be granted in collateral located in certain of
these jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in
any of these jurisdictions or in the jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor. Your rights under the Notes,
the security granted in respect of the Notes and guarantees of the Notes will therefore be subject to the laws of
multiple jurisdictions, and you may not be able to enforce effectively your rights in multiple bankruptcy,
insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex
and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’
rights. The consequences of the multiple jurisdictions involved in the Transactions could trigger disputes over
which jurisdiction’s law should apply which could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to
collect payment in full under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. In addition, certain jurisdictions may impose
limitations on the ability of foreign creditors to enforce security interests, including, for example, requiring
registration or approval under foreign ownership regulations. The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the
Guarantors are incorporated or organized further limit the ability of these subsidiaries to guarantee debt of, or
provide security for, other companies.

See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests” for a
brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Germany and Poland.

**_Each Notes Guarantee and security may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited_**
**_by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Notes Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor.
However, the Indenture will provide that each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can
be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee, as it relates to that
Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each Notes
Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. In addition, the Indenture will provide for
further limitations in accordance with the specific legal requirements in each Guarantor jurisdiction. See
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The same
limitations may apply to security interests (other than the Notes Guarantees) that will be provided by the
Guarantors in certain jurisdictions.

Enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees or security against any Guarantor will be subject to certain
defenses and limitations available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws and defenses generally
include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, the preservation of share capital, thin capitalization,
capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or
more of these laws, defenses and limitations are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased
liability under its Notes Guarantee or other security depending on the amounts of its other obligations and
applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions
could limit the enforceability of any Notes Guarantee against any Guarantor.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other
laws, a court could (i) void or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee,
direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or
to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (ii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if
the court found, among other things, that:

   - the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest in the Collateral was incurred with actual intent to
give preference to one creditor over another, to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the
Guarantor; or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Notes Guarantees has the effect of

65


-----

giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it
granted the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest;

   - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or
corporate benefit for the relevant Notes Guarantee and the Guarantor: (i) was insolvent or rendered
insolvent because of the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest; (ii) was undercapitalized or
became undercapitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed
that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

   - the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects of
the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor;

   - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law; or

   - the grant of the Notes Guarantee or security is, having regard to the risk accepted by the holders of the
Notes, on terms which are, or were, such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether
conditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the subscription for the Notes or otherwise
grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future Notes Guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries
pursuant to the Indenture or other securities pursuant to the Security Documents.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was
“insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine
that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a
Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes
constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The measure of insolvency for
purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would
be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: the sum of its debts, including contingent
liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets; the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the
amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities,
as they become due; or it cannot pay its debts as they become due.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee or other security will be limited to the amount that
will result in such Notes Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate
distribution, or otherwise being set aside or found to be in violation of the applicable statutory requirements in
each such jurisdiction. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a
determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor, or the effectiveness of limitation language. It is
possible that the entire Notes Guarantee or other security may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may
be extinguished. If a court decided that a Notes Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance
and voided such Notes Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim
in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other
Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Notes
Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Notes
Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable
Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Notes Guarantee is found to be a
preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever
repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.

**_We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control and the_**
**_occurrence of certain important corporate events will not constitute a Change of Control._**

The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “Change of Control” (as
defined in “Description of the Notes”). Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be required to offer
to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot
assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to
provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then-existing
contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A Change of Control may trigger a
mandatory prepayment of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other indebtedness even if such

66


-----

event is deemed not to be a change of control under the Indenture. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such
an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. The ability
of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the
occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may
not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control
were to occur at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of
repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the
Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such
borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer would remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we
expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of
Control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer
to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default
under the New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

The Change of Control provision that will be contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you
protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or
other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not
involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of
Control as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,”
the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes
in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a Change of Control will be
deemed not to be a Change of Control if a certain net consolidated leverage ratio calculated in accordance with
the “Description of the Notes” is not exceeded in connection with such an event. In this case, holders of Notes
would not be entitled to require the Issuer to repurchase their Notes and would only be able to rely on the then
prevailing trading prices in order to exit their investments, which might be lower than the 101% change of
control repurchase price. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Definitions—Change of Control Triggering Event.”_

The definition of Change of Control in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (if any), taken as a whole, to certain persons. Although there
is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a
Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the relevant
Notes.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of relevant Notes unless and
until definitive notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary (or its
nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be
made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments
will be credited to Euroclear and Clearstream participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Notes in
global form and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to Euroclear and
Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent, the
Calculation Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to
or payments of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, or to owners of book-entry
interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of
the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the
Notes under the Indenture.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or
requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including the enforcement of security for the
Notes and the Notes Guarantees. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act directly

67


-----

only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if
applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such
proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions or to take any other action on a timely
basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant
Definitive Registered Notes (as defined in “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”) are issued in respect of all bookentry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and
Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream
will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_**
**_limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

   - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

   - your ability to sell your Notes; or

   - the price at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for
non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the
prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected
by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in
prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which
the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such
disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial
performance. As a result, there can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no
active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes
on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or remain listed. Although no
assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to the Official List of the
Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing
on another stock exchange) of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a
holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue Additional Notes (as defined therein) in the future, which
could adversely impact the liquidity of the relevant series of Notes.

**_United States civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Germany, and the Guarantors and security providers are
incorporated under the laws of Germany and Poland. In addition, all members of our management board and our
officers reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process
within the United States upon us or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce outside
the United States judgments obtained against such persons in United States courts in any action. In addition, it
may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the
United States, including those of the Guarantors, rights predicated upon United States laws. See “Enforceability
_of Judgments.”_

Recovery in civil proceedings, ability to effect service of process and the recognition and enforceability of
judgments against Guarantors organized in jurisdictions are also subject to qualifications and local applicable
law. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests” on the
various relevant jurisdictions of the Issuer and Guarantors.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings
address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the

68


-----

likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential
impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that
may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may
be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that
a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the relevant Notes by one or more
of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost, terms and conditions of our financings, and could
adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or
the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in
the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. The
Notes are not being offered for sale in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A. We have
not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes with the SEC (including by way of an exchange
offer). See “Transfer Restrictions.” It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that their offers and sales
of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.

**_The Sponsor may have interests that do not align with yours._**

The Sponsor has the power to control our affairs and policies. The Sponsor also controls, to a large degree,
the election of directors, the appointment of management and the entry into mergers, sales of substantially all of
our assets and other extraordinary transactions. The directors so elected will have authority, subject to the terms
of our indebtedness (including the Notes), to issue additional stock, implement stock repurchase programs,
declare dividends and make other decisions. The interests of the Sponsor could conflict with your interests. For
example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our indebtedness as it matures, the interests of
the Sponsor and certain of its affiliates as equity holders might conflict with your interests as a holder of the
Notes. The Sponsor may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other
transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its equity investments, even though such transactions might
involve risks to you as a holder of the Notes or decrease the value of the Collateral securing the Notes.
Additionally, the Sponsor is in the business of making investments in companies, and may from time to time
acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are
suppliers or customers of ours. For more information, see “Our Shareholder” and “Certain Relationships and
_Related Party Transactions.”_

**_You may face foreign currency exchange risks as a result of investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you are a U.S. investor, an investment in the Notes
will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of
the euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no
control. Depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes
below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you on a U.S. dollar basis.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

If the stated redemption price at maturity of the Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount equal to or
greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount, then the Notes will be considered to be issued with original
issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are issued with OID, then, in addition
to the stated interest on the Notes, a U.S. Holder (as defined in “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal
_Income Tax Considerations”) will generally be required to include the OID on such Note in gross income (as_
ordinary income) as it accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in
advance of the receipt of the cash payments to which such OID is attributable and regardless of the U.S. Holder’s
regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S.
_Federal Income Tax Considerations.” Prospective investors should consult with their tax advisors regarding the_
application of such rules to the Notes.

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Debt Pushdown._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake the transactions described in “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Provisions Following an IPO” (such transactions, an “IPO_
Debt Pushdown”), pursuant to which the Issuers are entitled to give notice that will automatically operate so that,
among other things, the references in the Indentures and any Intercreditor Agreement to such Issuer and
Restricted Subsidiaries shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such
event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the
applicable Debt Documents. In either case, such modifications to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for
(ii) new Notes as in place after such modifications. If such modifications result in a deemed exchange for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, it would generally be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in which beneficial owners of the Notes would be required to recognize any gain or loss. Furthermore,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the new Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange could be treated
as issued with original issue discount. In such event, U.S. Holders would be required to include the original issue
discount in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. In
addition, the determination of whether the deemed new Notes are treated as “contingent payment debt
instruments” as a result of the possibility of additional payments, as further described above under “ —Additional
_Payments,” would be made at the time of the modification. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as_
to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to potential modifications of the Notes in connection with
the IPO Debt Pushdown. It is also possible that the IPO Debt Pushdown could result in a taxable event for tax
purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The gross proceeds from the Offering will be €750.0 million. We will use the proceeds of the Offering
together with our cash on hand to (i) fully repay the Existing Term Loan, including accrued interest; (ii) grant a
loan to the Parent so that the Parent may make a distribution to our Sponsor; and (iii) pay fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions.

The following table summarizes the estimated sources and uses of funds for the Transactions, assuming the
Offering was completed on December 31, 2020. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on
several factors, including the actual completion date of the Transactions, our actual fees and expenses and the
amount of borrowings and accrued interest under the Existing Term Loan on the Issue Date. We currently
anticipate that the New Revolving Credit Facility will be undrawn on the Issue Date.

Notes and the Floating Rate Notes at par.

(2) The amount of cash on hand used in connection with the Transactions will vary depending on our actual amount of cash and cash
equivalents on balance sheet as of the Issue Date.

(3) Represents the principal amount outstanding under the Existing Term Loan. This amount excludes accrued and unpaid interest, which as
of December 31, 2020 was €4.5 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Existing Euro-denominated Revolving Credit Facility and the
Existing PLN-denominated Revolving Credit Facility were undrawn. As of December 31, 2020, we also had €2.2 million outstanding in
non-cash guarantees under the Existing Credit Facilities, which will roll over to the New Revolving Credit Facility.

(4) We intend to grant a loan to the Parent with a portion of the proceeds from the Offering so that the Parent may make a distribution to our
Sponsor. The actual principal amount of the loan to the Parent on the Issue Date will vary depending on the available amount of cash on
the Issuer’s balance sheet, the actual amount of accrued and unpaid interest due on our Existing Term Loan and the actual amount of fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions.

(5) Represents estimated fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions, including discounts and other commissions, advisory and
other professional fees and other transaction costs. Actual fees and expenses may vary.

that date. The historical consolidated financial information of the Issuer as of December 31, 2020 has been
derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements. All amounts shown in the following table exclude
amortized deferred issuance costs and accrued and unpaid interest.

You should read this table in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial Information,” “Use of Proceeds,”

(1) Represents the amount outstanding under our Existing Term Loan as of December 31, 2020, excluding accrued and unpaid interest on
that date of €4.5 million.

(2) As of December 31, 2020, the Existing Euro-denominated Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn. The Existing Euro-denominated
Revolving Credit Facility will be replaced with the New Revolving Credit Facility upon the completion of this Offering. As of
December 31, 2020, the Existing PLN-denominated Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn. The Existing PLN-denominated Revolving
Credit Facility will be terminated upon the completion of this Offering and will be replaced by a separate financing arrangement to be
entered into by Panel East. The table above does not reflect €2.2 million of non-cash guarantees issued under the Existing Credit
Facilities, which will roll over to the New Revolving Credit Facility.

(3) The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for the €65.0 million New Revolving Credit Facility. While the New Revolving
Credit Facility is not currently expected to be drawn as of the Issue Date, as of December 31, 2020, we had issued guarantees in an
aggregate amount of €2.2 million under a separate guarantee facility within our Existing Credit Facilities. We anticipate that any
outstanding guarantees will be rolled into our New Revolving Credit Facility at the Issue Date. Actual borrowings or guarantees issued
under the New Revolving Credit Facility will depend on our working capital requirements.

(4) Represents the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be issued on the Issue Date.

(5) Represents primarily leases for land and buildings as well as office equipment and vehicles.

(6) Other indebtedness includes amounts outstanding under interest-bearing overdraft facilities.

(7) Excludes our €60 million securitization program and our PLN 40 million factoring facility. As of December 31, 2020, €29.0 million was
outstanding under our securitization program and €2 million (equivalent) was outstanding under our factoring facility. Our securitization
program and factoring facility are non-recourse (with the exception of certain purchase price reductions retained to minimize risk for the
buyer of our receivables) and obligations outstanding under our securitization program and our factoring facility are not reflected as a
liability on our consolidated statements of financial position. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Securitization
_Program.”_

(8) For purposes of this presentation, as adjusted total equity does not reflect the accounting impact of the Transactions.

- Our historical consolidated statement of cash flows reflects the effects on our cash flows from historical cash pooling arrangements with
our Parent and Panel East by way, amongst others, of intercompany loans, affecting in particular our net cash (used in)/provided by
investing activities as well as our net cash (used in)/provided financing activities, including payments made in the context of the
financing of the take private of our Parent by the Sponsor and the optimization of our corporate structure. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash Flows—Reported_
_Cash Flows.” In this offering memorandum, we also present and discuss our Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the years ended December 31,_
2018, 2019 and 2020, which excludes the effects of such intercompany transactions, which we consider to be largely exceptional, on our

**Overview**

With an operating history of over 125 years, Pfleiderer is a leading manufacturer of premium engineered
wood products and laminates for fast-growing, high-end applications in the Western European kitchen, furniture
and construction end-markets. Pfleiderer is also a leading producer of industrial and specialty resins for sales to
Central and Eastern European customers and for internal use in our panel production.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated €776.7 million in net sales and €152.0 million in Pro
_Forma Adjusted EBITDA (19.3% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin) as well as €71.0 million in Adjusted_
Free Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 2,200 people, serving a loyal and
diversified customer base of over 1,700 customers.

Our business comprises two divisions, Engineered Wood Products and Silekol, which represented 89% and
11%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales in 2020. With a market share of 14% by net sales in 2020, our
Engineered Wood Products division is the second largest manufacturer of premium engineered wood products
and laminates in the DACH region, which comprises Germany, Europe’s largest wood panel market, as well as
Austria and Switzerland. Our Silekol division is the third largest resin manufacturer by volume in Central and
Eastern Europe.

We primarily produce value-added and high value-added engineered wood products, which accounted for
78% of gross sales from our Engineered Wood Products division in the year ended December 31, 2020. We sell
our premium engineered wood products predominantly to customers in the fast-growing premium kitchen and the
robust and growing furniture end-markets, which together generated approximately 60% of our Engineered
Wood Products division’s gross sales in the year ended December 31, 2020. In the year ended
December 31, 2020, 91% of the external gross sales of our Engineered Wood Products division were to
customers located in Western Europe, which has allowed us to benefit from stable and growing market
environments. We estimate that in the same year we generated approximately 75% of gross sales in our
Engineered Wood Products division from the renovation and replacement segment. The renovation and
replacement segment has historically been resilient to cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions and has
contributed to our stable revenue generation and gross margins.

The following graphs illustrate the breakdown of our sales by division, segment and country for the year ended
December 31, 2020.

**Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

Our results of operations are affected by the following key factors, among others.

**_General Economic Conditions and Activity in Our End-markets_**

The overall level of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute, and consequently our financial
results, are affected by macroeconomic conditions and economic conditions in the regions in which we operate,
particularly the DACH region. In addition, demand for our products is driven by economic conditions in the
industries and end-markets to which we sell our products, including the construction industry and, in particular,
the kitchen and furniture end-markets. Within the construction industry, demand for our products is primarily
driven by the level of activity in the renovation and replacement segment. In the year ended December 31, 2020,
our Engineered Wood Products division generated 60% of its gross sales to customers in the kitchen and
furniture end-markets. In addition, we estimate that the renovation and replacement segment accounted for over
75% of gross sales of the Engineered Wood Products division in the year ended December 31, 2020, while the
new construction segment accounted for 22% of gross sales generated by our Engineered Wood Products
division. Demand for products manufactured by our Silekol division primarily depends on the level of activity in
the German and Polish wood-based panel production industries as well as in the packaging, construction and
building materials sectors, which contributed 81.7%, 7.7%, 6.5% and 4.1%, respectively, to our Silekol
division’s net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Historically, the kitchen and home furnishings industries have been subject to cyclical variations in
economic activity. The level of activity in the new construction and the replacement and renovation segments are
affected by factors such as unemployment levels, household income, consumer confidence, home equity values,
home equity loan withdrawals, consumer spending habits, reasonably attainable consumer financing, disposable
household income levels as well as interest rates. The renovation and replacement segment generally tends to be
more resilient when market conditions fluctuate compared to the new construction segment and is driven by the
need to modernize existing property stock. The renovation and replacement segment is also affected by shifting
consumer preferences as well as home interior and exterior design trends.

After a temporary recovery in 2011 from the global financial crisis of 2008 to 2009, the new construction
sector in some European countries came under pressure in the course of 2012 and 2013. This was due to the
depressed macroeconomic environment in the Eurozone, the tightening of public budgets, the challenging labor
market and a decrease in consumer confidence in much of Europe, which also affected our business at the time.
Similarly, in 2020, the kitchen and home furnishing industries in Europe came under temporary pressure as a
result of the various restrictions implemented by governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the
related negative effects on the overall economic conditions in our key geographical markets. For example,
kitchen and furniture producers in Germany and Poland had to temporarily shut down their production facilities
as a result of the lockdown orders imposed in connection with the outbreak of the pandemic. Accordingly,
demand for our products from these industries declined, in particular in the second quarter of 2020 compared to
the same period in 2019. Starting from the third quarter of 2020, when restrictive measures were largely relaxed
in Europe, the renovation and replacement segment benefitted from the general improvement in macroeconomic
conditions and consumer confidence. In addition, as a result of lockdown orders and other restrictive measures
implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our end-customers from the kitchen furniture, furniture
and construction sectors benefitted from an acceleration of certain secular trends that already existed before the
pandemic, such as the increase in the time spent at home and the shift to remote working, which increased the
attractiveness of premium kitchen furniture. As a result, the demand for the products of both our Engineered

77


-----

Wood Products and our Silekol divisions recovered to pre-pandemic levels and then continued to grow.
However, the recovery and growth we experienced in the second half of 2020 were not sufficient to fully
compensate the decline in demand during the second quarter of 2020, and our overall sales volumes and net sales
in the year ended December 31, 2020 remained below 2019 levels.

**_Product Mix_**

Our Engineered Wood Products division offers a broad range of basic, value-added and high value-added
products in a variety of finishes, functionalities and designs. Our Silekol division offers a broad range of
industrial and specialty resins and other chemicals. Pricing of our products is dependent on various factors, such
as the cost of the underlying raw materials, the features and quality of products, supply and demand in our
markets and the nature of, and the dynamics in, our customers’ businesses and industries. In addition, both the
prices and the margins of our products vary. As a result, changes in the mix of our product sales have a direct
impact on our consolidated net sales and profitability.

We typically achieve higher margins on sales in our value-added and high value-added products because
many of such products, particularly those for the kitchen, furniture and construction end-markets, are
“made-to-order” or have special characteristics that make them more difficult to substitute than basic products.
Similarly, the margins on our specialty resins are typically higher than the margins on our industrial resins and
other chemicals. This is because specialty resins are manufactured for specific functions that are not commonly
found in the market while industrial resins are more readily available to purchase from our competitors. As a
result, growth in sales of our value-added and high value-added products as well as specialty resins generally
tend to have a larger impact on our overall profitability as compared to growth in sales of basic products,
industrial resins and other chemicals

In the year ended December 31, 2020, our high value-added products accounted for 55% of our Engineered
Wood Products division’s gross sales to external customers and generated contribution margins which were on
average more than ten percentage points higher than the average contribution margins of our basic products in
the same year. Our value-added products accounted for 23% of our Engineered Wood Products division’s gross
sales in 2020 and generated contribution margins which were on average five percentage points higher than the
average contribution margins of our basic products in the same year. In the year ended December 31, 2020, our
basic products accounted for 21% of our Engineered Wood Products division’s gross sales. In the year ended
December 31, 2020, our specialty resins accounted for 24% of our Silekol division’s net sales and generated
average contribution margins which were over ten percentage points higher than the average contribution
margins of our industrial resins in the same year. In the year ended December 31, 2020, sales of industrial resins
accounted for 74% of our Silekol division’s net sales.

**_Ability to Pass on Increased Raw Material Costs to Customers_**

Our results of operations are affected by the speed and the extent to which we can pass through price
increases in raw materials, energy, transportation and other key cost items to our customers.

While product prices in customer contracts in our Engineered Wood Products division are typically fixed for
the term of the agreements, the duration of such agreements tends to be relatively short, with average terms of
three to six months. This generally short duration allows us to adjust product prices based on changes in raw
material prices on a relatively regular basis. In addition, product prices in some of our contracts are agreed until
further notice, which allows us to change our pricing more flexibly. In our Silekol division, the majority of
customer contracts include pass-through mechanisms for changes in raw material costs, which is customary in
the chemical industry. Pursuant to these mechanisms, prices are typically adjusted quarterly or semi-annually
based on the actual level of relevant raw material indices observed in the previous three months.

In addition, our procurement function continuously reviews our key supply markets as well as the relevant
prices for our key input factors, seeking to anticipate future raw material price changes as we determine the
pricing terms for our products.

Due to the “made-to-order” nature of our value-added and high value-added products in our Engineered
Wood Products division and the distinct character of our specialty resins, our customers would be subject to
significant lead times and high switching costs if they transitioned to a new supplier due to the need for
consistency in décor and finish. As a result, customers of our value-added and high value-added products have
historically shown lower sensitivity to price increases or pass-through of increased material costs. This is also
due to the fact that the cost for our value-added and high-value add additional products typically represents a

78


-----

smaller percentage of their total finished product budget. As a result, we have historically been able to maintain
high margins during times of rising raw material prices. Prices of our basic products and industrial resins are
primarily determined by the level of supply and demand. These products do not have significant distinguishing
qualities and are more uniform across different producers. Therefore, competition is primarily based on price.
This has historically limited our ability to increase the price of our basic products and industrial resins to pass
increased raw material costs to our customers, particularly when supply levels are higher than demand levels.

Over the last several years, we have generally been successful in passing through our raw material costs to
our customers in a timely manner when raw material costs were rising and in delaying the pass through of raw
material costs to our customers when raw material costs were declining. During 2020, the raw material prices for
wood, glue, paper, and resins decreased, which resulted in lower sales prices for our engineered wood products.
Despite this decrease in raw material prices, we achieved a positive net pass-through of €13.4 million for
products of our Engineered Wood Products division as our sales prices did not decrease as much as raw material
prices.

**_Cost Base_**

As a manufacturer of wood-based and chemical products, we primarily rely on raw materials, energy and
labor as well as repair and maintenance materials and services at our production facilities. As a seller and
distributor of our products, we rely on transportation and logistics services as well as our own sales and
marketing staff and third party marketing and distribution services. As a leader in product quality and innovation,
we rely on our in-house research and development staff as well as external services. We also operate information
technology systems across all of our functions and divisions and relay on administrative staff and headquarter
functions to manage our operations and determine our business strategy.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, 66% of our cost base excluding depreciation and amortization (which
represents 56% of our net sales) comprised variable costs that fluctuated in proportion to production output. For
example, raw material costs, including for wood, paper and chemicals, are directly correlated with production
volumes. Freight costs and costs for packaging materials as well as other consumables used in production
processes are also highly correlated with both production and sales volumes. A large portion of our energy costs
changes in line with production volumes as we are able to reduce the operating times of our plants and equipment
when usage rates decline. In 2020, as a result of the restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic
by governments in our countries of operation which forced some of our customers to partially halt production
and/or partially close their plants, we were able to adjust our production output and reduce our capacity by
halting production of individual product lines due to the temporary decrease in demand for our products.

A further 21% of our cost base excluding depreciation and amortization (which represents approximately
18% of our net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2020, were semi-variable costs, which primarily related to
direct labor costs in our production facilities where we can change our shift patterns in order to adapt our output
to changes in demand. We also use overtime as well as temporary staff in our production sites to cover periods of
strong demand, which, at the same time, allows us to adjust our labor costs when demand decreases. In addition,
we may adjust our repair and maintenance schedules, within reasonable limits, in response to changing
conditions on the demand side. In addition to freight costs, there are other portions of our selling expenses (such
as travel and entertainment as well as marketing and advertising costs) which are of a discretionary nature and
can therefore be delayed or frozen to the extent necessary.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, the remaining 13% of our cost base excluding depreciation and
amortization (which represents approximately 11% of our net sales) comprised costs related to our production
overhead and infrastructure, our fixed selling as well as our G&A and R&D expenses, which we consider largely
fixed in nature.

_Raw Material and Energy Costs_

Raw materials and other inputs required for the production of our products are the largest component of our
cost of sales. As a result, our margins are impacted by variations in the cost of our raw materials. In the year
ended December 31, 2020, the expense for raw materials and energy used in the production by our Engineered
Wood Products division amounted to €310.6 million, or 45%, of divisional net sales. Wood, chemicals, paper and
energy represented 26%, 30%, 21% and 7%, respectively, of the Engineered Wood Products division’s raw
material and energy costs. In the same period, the expense for raw materials and energy used in the production by
our Silekol division amounted to €86.9 million, or 72% of divisional net sales.

The cost for most of our raw materials is primarily influenced by prevailing macroeconomic conditions and
the general macroeconomic outlook and, historically, raw material prices have decreased during an economic
downturn and increased during periods of economic expansion. In addition, the cost for our raw materials is
influenced by the supply and demand levels in the relevant raw material markets, which may in turn be
influenced by the production capacities of our suppliers and other factors beyond our control.

In contrast to the commodity chemical and paper markets, which tend to be driven by the general economic
and industry-specific situation on a global or European level, wood supplies, whether for recycled wood, waste
wood, sawmill residues or for fresh wood, are mainly influenced by local market dynamics. Wood supply is
influenced by factors such weather (including adverse weather events such as droughts, storms or fires),
infestations of insects or pests and diseases, all of which are beyond our control and that of our suppliers. For
example, for a number years, German forests have been suffering from bark beetle plagues. As beetle-infested
trees have to be cut down to prevent the pest from spreading through entire forests, there has been a continuous
rise in the supply of wood residues, which has led to a decline in wood prices. As we are one of the largest wood
buyers in Europe, we are able to realize certain scale benefits, especially as the wood supplier base is relatively
fragmented.

We generally manage the purchase of our all of our key raw materials carefully and tend to solicit pricing
from multiple suppliers in order to maintain negotiating leverage and ensure security of supply. At the same time,
34% of the chemicals used by our Engineered Wood Products division is sourced from our Silekol division,
which we believe contributes to the resilience of our supply chain.

We typically enter into supply agreements with a duration of three, six or twelve months to cover a
significant portion of our raw material requirements. This has allowed us to mitigate the effect of rising or
fluctuating raw material costs on our business. We typically purchase wood and paper one quarter in advance at
fixed prices, electricity in advance for the whole year and chemicals one month or one quarter in advance. The
majority of our energy needs are covered by our own biomass-based CHP plants which use waste wood to
generate heat and steam as well as electricity for our production processes. We cover our additional electricity
needs by entering into annual contracts for approximately 60% to 70% of our additional electricity demand as
well as short-term forward contracts for a further 20% to 30% of the energy we purchase.

_Transportation Costs_

We incur transportation costs for the delivery of our products to our customers. Transportation distances for
our engineered wood products are typically restricted to distances of 50 to 600 kilometers, which is partially due
to our production facilities being located close to our key customers. In the year ended December 31, 2020, our
transportation costs, which include freight for deliveries from our production facilities or other warehouses to our
customers amounted to a total of €53.6 million, or 7%, of our net sales. Through our JURA logistics subsidiary,
we operate our own fleet of 36 leased trucks through which we carry out approximately 11% of our
transportation needs. The remaining 89% of our transportation needs are carried out by third parties, which are
selected and managed centrally by JURA-Spedition GmbH. Increases in transportation costs, such as those
caused by an increase in fuel costs or road tolls, have a noticeable effect on our results. In 2019, we engaged
Inverto to review our transportation costs and to identify and deliver cost savings through re-tendering, supplier
consolidation and other adjustments. We have also been separately implementing other procurement logistics
savings and with effect from September 2019, we have put in place new rates for freight tenders. In the third
quarter of 2020, we finalized the rationalization and specialization of our own transportation fleet, reducing our
fleet from 53 trucks in the year ended December 31, 2019 to 36 as of September 30, 2020.

Due to the mix of our distribution channels and the implementation of government support programs for the
transport sector, we experienced only very minor disruption in respect to the delivery of our products during the
COVID-19 pandemic, mainly due to a temporary shortage of transportation capacities during the first phase of
the outbreak. Our transportation costs in the year ended December 31, 2020 remained broadly in line with those
incurred in the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Headcount and Labor Costs_

Our headcount levels impact our costs and profitability. As of December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we had
2,363, 2,309 and 2,227 employees, respectively. Our personnel expenses (including salaries and social
contributions) in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were €154.0 million, €159.9 million and €152.3 million, respectively. A
portion of our headcount expenses are fixed and we are required to maintain certain headcount levels to provide
production capacity, sales capabilities and administrative support despite fluctuations in our business; however,
we are able to make redundancies as a result of automation of our processes or to address market developments
and capacity and administration requirements. Our production processes also allow for flexible-shift systems and
enables us to increase or reduce the number of shifts, and we use of temporary labor in our production facilities
in line with demand for our products. We have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with labor unions in
certain of the countries in which we operate, such as Germany, in order to allow for flexible working hour
programs, pursuant to which employees work overtime in periods of high demand for no extra salary, in
exchange for fewer working hours in periods of lower demand. We also routinely conduct reviews of our
business to determine whether we have any duplicative functions that could be eliminated to reduce labor costs.
For example, as part of our manufacturing headcount reduction program, which commenced in 2019, we have
been streamlining and resizing our functions at our production facilities, which resulted in a decrease in the
number of permanent staff at our Engineered Wood Products production facilities by more than 10% between
2017 and 2020. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we further optimized our labor cost by utilizing
government salary subsidies in Germany (Kurzarbeitergeld) and Poland. See also “—COVID-19 Impact on our
_Business.”_

**_Degree of Capacity Utilization_**

Our results of operations are affected by the degree of utilization of available capacity in our industry and at
our production facilities. Typically if utilization rates are high, competitors in our market will exhibit price
discipline and we will be able to charge higher prices for our products. We estimate that total engineered wood
production capacity in Western Europe has been reduced significantly since 2005, primarily as a consequence of
production facilities being shut down after the global financial crisis of 2008 to 2009, with a slight uptick in
production capacity in recent years due to increased automation and production efficiencies in the industry. There
are high cost and regulatory barriers to constructing new facilities in our markets, limiting the prospect of further
market-wide overcapacities.

High capacity utilization at our production facilities results in a reduction in our production costs per unit
and our fixed costs are spread across larger volumes, resulting in higher profitability. Conversely, if the degree of
capacity utilization at our production facilities declines, the production costs per unit increase and we may have
to adjust our production outcome, resulting in lower profitability. To address concerns of overcapacity at our

81


-----

production facilities, we rationalized our footprint from 22 production facilities globally in 2009 to six
production facilities in Germany and Poland in 2020. We now focus on managing available capacity efficiently
and on a sustainable basis, which, despite the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the second quarter
of 2020, has resulted in capacity utilization at our production facilities of nearly 90% with respect to our basic
products as well as our value-added products and approximately 85% for our high value-added products in the
year ended December 31, 2020. For example, we have historically scheduled planned shutdowns of our
production facilities for two-week periods over the holidays in spring and summer to conduct maintenance, but
have now lengthened the time between scheduled maintenance procedures and reduced the duration of our
planned shutdowns. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we incurred capital
expenditures of €16.6 million and €11.0 million in our Engineered Wood Products division, respectively, mainly
resulting in the optimization of recycled wood usage and heightened productivity in board production. As a result
of these production efficiencies and the fact that our equipment generally has a very long useful life given proper
maintenance, we have capacity for increased production at our facilities in the future without requiring additional
significant capital expenditure.

Our business operations are subject to limited seasonal and weather-related influences. Our most important
trading periods in terms of net sales, operating results and cash flow have historically been in the second half of
the calendar year, in particular September, October and November, driven by an increase in activity in the
renovation, replacement and new construction segments in advance of the holiday season. We typically generate
less net sales during the December holiday season during which our customers tend to reduce their working
hours, and during the second quarter of the calendar year. Our profitability is less seasonal than our net sales
because our purchases of raw materials decline during quieter months, and our transportation and energy costs
also decline. Our results are also affected by periods of abnormal, severe or unseasonable weather conditions,
which may affect our supply and distribution chains, particularly if such events occur during our peak sales
period.

**_Cost and Efficiency Improvement Initiatives_**

Over the past two years, we have implemented a comprehensive range of cost and efficiency improvement
initiatives aimed at enhancing our profitability and further improving our ability to respond to changes in the
demand for our end products by further increasing the flexibility of our cost structure. In the Engineered Wood
Products division, these cost savings initiatives included (i) certain material efficiency initiatives aimed at
reducing raw material costs, (ii) our headcount reduction programs, which are primarily aimed at reducing
permanent staff levels at our production facilities, (iii) certain headcount optimization programs in our sales
back-office and other administrative functions, (iv) certain indirect procurement cost savings initiatives to further
optimize purchasing terms, primarily for indirect spend categories and (v) certain logistics cost savings measures
including the partial outsourcing of our in-house trucking activities and the re-tendering of logistics contracts. In
the Silekol division, our cost savings initiatives are primarily aimed at improving energy efficiency by reducing
energy costs at Silekol’s production facilities as well as at achieving raw material cost savings through actions
intended to increase material efficiencies in 2021.

All of these initiatives together generated cost savings of €12.9 million and €20.5 million, respectively, in
the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. In addition, we estimate that our cost and efficiency improvement
initiatives will generate additional cost savings in the amount of €11.8 million in the year ending December 31,
2021, consisting of (i) €3.2 million in run-rate cost savings that we would have realized if we had fully
implemented the actions we completed during the year ended December 31, 2020 as of January 1, 2020, and
(ii) €8.6 million in additional expected cost savings that we identified in the year ended December 31, 2020 and
that we intend to implement in the year ending December 31, 2021.

We believe that the implementation of our cost savings and efficiency initiatives has resulted in a lower and
more flexible cost base, which we can adjust to levels of production output and market demand, thus resulting in
reduced operating leverage. These improvements to our cost base have positively contributed to our net profit
and margin expansion in the second half of 2020, particularly the fourth quarter of 2020, when market demand
started to recover following the initial market disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and have allowed
us to return to our long-term growth trajectory.

While it is our objective to reach the levels of projected savings in the timeframe reflected below, we cannot give
any assurance that we will be able to realize all or any portion of these costs savings within the anticipated

timeframe or at all, or that additional or unanticipated costs will not arise, which may make it more costly to
realize such savings. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Market and Our Business—The adjustments to Pro
_Forma Adjusted EBITDA annualizing the impact of certain cost savings measures and giving effect to expected_
_benefits from certain price improvement initiatives as presented in this offering memorandum should be treated_
_with caution when making an investment decision.”_

_Engineered Wood Products Division Cost Savings_

Headcount Reduction Program—Manufacturing Labor

During the second quarter of 2019, a leading consulting firm conducted a detailed site level assessment at
our Neumarkt, Gütersloh and Arnsberg facilities in order to identify headcount reduction opportunities. We
subsequently applied the findings from this assessment also to our Leutkirch and Baruth facilities as well as to
our JURA logistics subsidiary in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. Overall, we identified opportunities to
reduce headcount at our five German production facilities by 116 FTEs.

On December 31, 2019, we entered into framework social plan and reconciliation of interests agreements
with our group-wide German works council, which have formed the legal framework for all of our subsequent
headcount optimization programs. Following the agreement with our group-wide German works council, we also
entered into reconciliation of interests agreements with local works councils for our Neumarkt and Gütersloh
plants as well as for our JURA logistics subsidiary.

Based on our assessment of the overall headcount reduction potential, during the year ended December 31,
2019, we reduced staff in Neumarkt, Gütersloh and at JURA by 54 FTEs. The headcount actions taken in 2019
resulted in costs savings of €1.2 million as reflected in our financial results for the year ended December 31,
2019. The run rate savings that we would have realized if we had fully implemented the redundancy measures
that we undertook during the year ended December 31, 2019 on January 1, 2019 amounted to €2.2 million and
would have had a €3.4 million impact on our net profit for the year ended December 31, 2020.

In the first quarter of 2020, we also implemented local reconciliation of interest agreements at our remaining
plants, which led to a further reduction in our headcount by 46 FTEs in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Together with the run rate savings from the headcount actions implemented in 2019, these further headcount
reduction measures generated costs savings of €6.4 million in 2020. We would have realized €1.3 million of run
rate savings had we fully implemented the redundancy measures that we undertook during the year ended
December 31, 2020 on January 1, 2020.

We expect to complete the reduction of headcount in our production facilities by a further 16 FTEs through
a combination of redundancies, early retirement arrangements and other rationalization measures. We estimate
that these additional redundancies will generate €0.6 million in expected cost savings in the year ending
December 31, 2021. Together with the €1.3 million of benefits from the run-rate cost savings from the 2020
headcount actions, we estimate to achieve a total of €1.9 million in the year ending December 31, 2021.

In connection with the implementation of our manufacturing headcount reduction program, we recorded
accruals for restructuring costs in the amount of €8.1 million and €4.8 million in our financial statements for the
years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. A portion of these accruals related to the reduction in the
number of FTEs that took place in December 2019 and 2020 with the remainder and all of the severance accruals
relating to the reduction in the number of FTEs that will take place during 2021. We have also made severance
payments in an amount of €1.0 million and €1.8 million in 2019 and 2020, respectively, from such accruals.

Headcount Reduction Program—SG&A

In the fourth quarter of 2018, with the assistance of a leading global consultancy firm, we conducted a
review of certain sales back-office as well as administrative functions. By optimizing our processes and
implementing information technology systems to drive automation across these functions, we were able to reduce
the headcount in certain areas at our headquarters and at our production sites by 34 FTEs in 2019 and by another
43 FTEs in 2020. This generated SG&A cost savings of €1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019
and €2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, which are reflected in our results for those periods.
We expect to further reduce the headcount in central functions by an additional 38 FTEs by the end of 2021,
mainly across our sales back-office and supply chain functions, through a combination of redundancies, early
retirement arrangements and other FTE rationalization measures. We estimate that the initiatives completed at
the end of 2020 and the additional headcount reduction in 2021 will result in additional cost savings in the

83


-----

amount of €2.3 million in the year ending December 31, 2021, consisting of (i) €1.4 million in run-rate cost
savings that we would have realized if we had fully implemented the employee headcount reductions that we
undertook during the year ended December 31, 2020 on January 1, 2020, and of (ii) €0.9 million in additional
expected cost savings from further employee headcount reductions that we identified in the year ended
December 31, 2020.

Procurement Cost Reduction Initiatives

Following a review of our supply arrangements for indirect spend categories by a leading consulting firm in
the second half of 2018, we successfully implemented new services and supply agreements across the Group
during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. As a result, of these new supply agreement, we are
benefiting from a reduced number of standardized materials across our facilities, a more consolidated supplier
base, tighter procurement controls and better pricing primarily for expenses incurred in connection with
maintenance and repair material and services, packaging material as well as for fleet and fuel costs. These actions
generated procurement cost savings of €1.8 million and €2.7 million in 2019 and 2020, respectively. We estimate
that we will realize additional €1.8 million in cost savings in the year ending December 31, 2021 by using the
new processes and systems which we implemented in 2019 and 2020, when renegotiating new agreements for the
abovementioned spend categories with our suppliers and vendors during 2021. In connection with these
initiatives, we incurred expenses of €1.5 million and €0.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2020, respectively, mainly relating to consulting fees and external support for the new integrated facility
management system implemented as part of this program.

Material Efficiency

In 2020, our Engineered Wood Products division implemented several initiatives aimed at reducing
materials costs. Key actions include (i) a further increase of the percentage of recycled wood used in our woodbased products, (ii) streamlining the number of SKUs produced from 45,000 to 30,000 in order to reduce
production complexity (implemented during 2020) and (iii) adopting data-driven processes to improve raw
material yields. We estimate that these initiatives led to cost savings of €7.3 million and €4.7 million in the years
ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. We estimate that we will realize an additional €4.0 million in
cost savings in the year ending December 31, 2021 from these actions as well as from additional material
efficiency actions that we partially initiated, but did not fully implement, in the year ended December 31, 2020
and that we intend to fully implement in the year ending December 31, 2021.

Logistics Cost Reduction Initiatives

In April 2019, we engaged a leading global consultancy firm to assist us in re-tendering certain of our
logistics contracts. This resulted in the successful execution of new agreements with logistics companies in
September 2019. Additionally, in September 2019, we also began outsourcing certain standard transportation
services, previously performed by our in-house trucking fleet, to lower cost, external freight forwarding
companies, while our JURA logistics subsidiary started to focus on specialized transportation services, such as
round-trips completed by our walking-floor trucks. This resulted in a reduction of our in-house trucking fleet by
approximately 32% and a decrease in headcount at our JURA logistics subsidiary by 18 FTEs. This reduction in
headcount was implemented through a combination of redundancies, early retirement arrangements and other
FTE rationalization measures, which has also been agreed with the respective works councils as part of the
overall manufacturing headcount optimization. By staggering the contract terms for leasing trucks and trailers,
we managed to improve our flexibility. Together, these initiatives have resulted in logistics cost savings of
€3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. We estimate that these initiatives will result in additional cost
savings in the amount of €0.6 million in the year ending December 31, 2021, consisting of (i) €0.3 million in runrate cost savings that we would have realized if we had fully implemented the logistics cost savings that we
undertook during the year ended December 31, 2020 on January 1, 2020, and (ii) €0.3 million in additional
expected cost savings from further logistics cost saving measures that we identified in the year ended
December 31, 2020. As we have terminated our leasing contracts at their respective termination dates, we did not
incur any significant costs relating to these initiatives in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.

_Silekol Division Cost Savings_

To enhance energy efficiency and reduce energy costs within our Silekol operations, we installed a steam
expander unit at our Silekol production facility, which allows us to generate our own electricity. The new steam
expander unit has been in operation since December 2019. In addition, our Silekol division started implementing

84


-----

certain initiatives aimed at achieving raw material cost savings and adopting data-driven processes to improve
raw materials yield in 2020. Together, these initiatives resulted in aggregate cost savings of €1.2 million in our
Silekol division, which are already reflected in our results for the year ended December 31, 2020. We estimate
that these initiatives will result in additional cost savings in the amount of €1.2 million in the year ending
December 31, 2021, consisting of (i) €0.2 million in run-rate cost savings that we would have realized if we had
implemented such energy and material efficiency initiatives that we undertook during the year ended
December 31, 2020 on January 1, 2020, and (ii) €1.0 million in additional expected cost savings from further
material efficiency measures that we identified in the year ended December 31, 2020 and that we intend to
implement in the year ending December 31, 2021.

**_Engineered Wood Products Price Improvement Initiatives_**

During the second quarter of 2020, as part of our budgeting process for 2021, we identified a number of
opportunities to improve product pricing in our Engineered Wood Products division, which we aim to realize by
the end of 2021 through the implementation of (i) a strategic review of our pricing across our product portfolio
through the implementation of new pricing rules and certain structural pricing initiatives and (ii) structural price
increases on certain products from our new 2021-2024 collection. We also started implementing general price
increases based on market demand and opportunistic base product pricing. We incurred one-off costs and capital
expenditures of €0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection with these price improvement
initiatives and estimate that we will incur capital expenditures of approximately €0.5 million in the year ending
December 31, 2021.

Although it is our objective to reach the levels of projected structural price improvements reflected below,
no assurance can be given that such levels will be achieved in the time frame indicated or at all or that additional
unanticipated costs will not arise. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Market and Our Business—The
_adjustments to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA annualizing the impact of certain cost savings measures and giving_
_effect to expected benefits from certain price improvement initiatives as presented in this offering memorandum_
_should be treated with caution when making an investment decision.”_

_Implementation of New Pricing Rules_

In the second quarter of 2020, we engaged a leading global consultancy firm to conduct a strategic review of
pricing across our product portfolio aimed at fixing certain structural gaps and systems and implementing new
pricing rules into our ERP systems to improve pricing discipline and invoicing. Following this strategic pricing
review, we implemented a number of structural pricing initiatives to improve pricing accuracy across all our
products and customers as well as our invoicing process. These structural pricing initiatives included (i) the
automatic application of contractually agreed surcharges to low volume orders, (ii) list price optimizations,
(iii) the reduction of the number of small, unprofitable orders and (iv) the implementation of certain other price
quality management actions, including price differentiation on product value, clear pricing escalation procedures,
price quality reporting and upgraded information technology systems. We estimate that these initiatives will have
a total impact on our Adjusted EBITDA of approximately €5.3 million by the end of 2021. We expect
€3.0 million thereof will be generated from measures that were implemented and fully operational in our ERP
systems in the year ended December 31, 2020 and that we have applied to new customer purchases since
January 1, 2021, as if such structural pricing initiatives had been agreed on January 1, 2020. In estimating the
impact from these measures on our results, we have assumed that our sales volumes actually achieved during the
year ended December 31, 2020 would have remained unchanged from sales volumes of corresponding products
to such customers during the year ending December 31, 2021. Our sales staff are unable to manually override the
new pricing rules that were implemented in our ERP systems unless such action has been approved by our Chief
Operating Officer. We estimate that these new pricing rules have positively contributed to new customer
purchases since January 2021 and will further benefit our results as volumes for 2021 exceed our 2020 volumes.
We expect the total contribution to our Adjusted EBITDA from these initiatives to amount to approximately
€15 million by the end of 2023.

_Structural Price Increases_

In connection with the launch of our new 2021-2024 product collection in 2021, we increased the price of
certain value-added and high value-added products of our Engineered Wood Products division. Our new fouryear collection of value-added and high value-added products replaced our existing collection on January 1,
2021. We estimate that these price increases will contribute €8.6 million to our Adjusted EBITDA for the year
ending December 31, 2021, which is less than 40% of agreed price increases with certain customers as of
December 31, 2020.

**_The Optimization of Our Corporate Structure_**

Historically, our Parent operated our business through three divisions, Engineered Wood Products, Silekol
and Panel East. Following the take private of our Parent in September 2019, our Sponsor separated our
Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions from Panel East. We now operate our Engineered Wood
Products and Silekol divisions together through the Issuer, while Panel East operates independently and on an
arm’s-length basis. As a result of the optimization of our corporate structure, we believe we benefit from a
strongly enhanced credit profile due to (i) an improved business mix with strong market position in the more
stable and attractive Western European market, (ii) greater focus on value-add products with a loyal and more
diversified customer base and (iii) higher and more resilient margin and cash flow profiles.

_The Silekol Transfer_

Starting from 2019, we reorganized the divisions of the Parent by transferring all of the outstanding share
capital of Silekol sp.z o.o., which used to operate the Silekol division, from Pfleiderer Polska sp.z o.o., which
operates the Panel East division, to the Issuer (the “Silekol Transfer”). In connection with the Silekol Transfer,
all shares in Silekol sp.z o.o. held by Pfleiderer Polska sp.z o.o. were sold in a cashless transaction to the Parent
in return for an intercompany receivable owed by the Parent to Pfleiderer Polska sp.z o.o. Subsequently, the
Parent transferred all of the shares in Silekol sp.z o.o., having an aggregate equity value of €80.3 million, to the
Issuer in partial repayment of an existing €117.5 million loan (the “Parent Loan”) from the Issuer to the Parent.
We completed the Silekol Transfer on March 6, 2020. Following the completion of the Silekol Transfer,
€31.5 million remain outstanding under the Parent Loan as of December 31, 2020.

_Supply and Distribution Agreements with Panel East_

In connection with the optimization of our corporate structure, our Silekol division entered into the five-year
Panel East Resin Supply Agreement with Panel East. In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer’s Engineered
Wood Products entered into the Wood Products Supply and Distribution Agreement with Panel East. In the year
ended December 31, 2020, sales of resins from our Silekol division to Panel East generated €34.2 million, or
28%, of Silekol’s net sales in the same year. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2020, sales by our
Engineered Wood Products division to its external customers of products manufactured by Panel East generated
approximately €39.6 million, or 6%, of our Engineered Wood Products division’s external net sales. In the same
year, sales by Panel East to its external customers of products manufactured by our Engineered Wood Products
division generated net sales of our Engineered Wood Products division of approximately €8.7 million. See
“Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

While the Panel East Resin Supply Agreement has an initial term of five years, during which we expect to
generate stable net sales through the sale of resin and other chemicals to Panel East, the Wood Products Supply
and Distribution Agreement with Panel East may be terminated under certain circumstances, which could lead to
the loss of all or any portion of the net sales of our Engineered Wood Products division pursuant to such
arrangement.

**_COVID-19 Impact on Our Business_**

Our results of operation in the year ended December 31, 2020 have been impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic. Following a 40% increase in Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first
quarter of 2019, Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2020 in our Engineered Wood Products division
declined sharply, by approximately 33% compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of lower
sales volumes due to the restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in most of our
countries of operation, which led to a temporary shutdown of the production facilities of certain of our key
customers, especially in the kitchen and furniture industries, as well as lower raw material prices, which we
partially passed through to our customers. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2020 in our Silekol
division remained in line with Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of
procurement improvements as well as fixed and variable costs efficiency initiatives. Starting with the third
quarter of 2020, Adjusted EBITDA in our Engineered Wood Products division rebounded, growing by 3%
compared to Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2019 and 23% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to
Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily driven by our diversified end-market exposure and
strong demand for our value-added and high value-added products for the renovation and replacement segment,
which has historically been more resilient to cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions than the new
construction due to lower investment requirements, the minimum levels of required or periodic renovations and

86


-----

the increase in housing stock and real estate transactions. In addition, we were able to offset the overall decline in
sales volumes and lower raw material and energy costs by leveraging our more streamlined cost structure as a
result of the cost savings and efficiency initiatives that we started implementing in the year ended December 31,
2019, and due to our ability to keep sales prices relatively high despite declining raw material and energy costs
which enabled us to achieve a net positive pass-through of input costs. Overall, in the year ended December 31,
2020, our Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions recorded a decrease in net sales of 5.6% and 13.6%,
respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, while our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA margin increased by over 7% and 2%, respectively, during the same period compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019.

The following table presents our estimated gross profit, gross profit margin, Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA margin a quarterly basis for the periods indicated. This data has been derived from our
unaudited management accounts and has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors or any other party.

While we generally consider our supply chains to be resilient, we experienced limited disruption and delays
in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we faced longer delivery times, especially for
supply orders requiring cross-border transportation. Furthermore, sourcing recycled wood became more difficult,
as a result of which we were required to purchase higher volumes of sawmill products and round wood, which
have higher costs compared to recycled wood. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the expense for our raw
materials decreased by €48.0 million or 12.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. We believe that
in connection with the second wave of the pandemic in the fourth quarter of 2020, we and our customers and
suppliers implemented appropriate measures to respond to social distancing and local lockdown measures which
have not had the same impact on our business and supply chain as the restrictions implemented in the first and
second quarter of 2020. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have seen a limited impact on our trade
accounts receivable arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in relation to accounts receivables from
customers located in countries other than Germany. In addition, we have not experienced a significant ageing of
our trade receivables and have seen a positive recovery of previously overdue accounts receivable in the second
half of 2020. In addition, we maintain insurance coverage for the vast majority of our trade accounts receivables.

In order to preserve quick access to liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily drew amounts
available for borrowing under our Existing Euro-denominated Revolving Credit Facility, which we subsequently
repaid in full during the third quarter of 2020, and as of December 31, 2020, no amounts were outstanding under
our Existing Euro-denominated Revolving Credit Facility. To manage our cost structure, reduce our use of cash
and further preserve our liquidity position during the pandemic, we implemented several COVID-19 crisis
management initiatives, including a hiring freeze across all of our operations, the establishment of a dedicated
credit management process as well as other short-term cost reduction measures such as the reduction of
marketing and travel expenses. In addition, we placed a limited number of our capital expenditure projects on
hold and intensified our focus on sales management and capital discipline. At the same time, we took advantage
of government support programs, including salary subsidies, in Germany (Kurzarbeitergeld) and Poland and
benefited from certain changes in tax rules introduced as a result of COVID-19, such as deferrals of certain tax
payments.

In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, we set up a dedicated crisis management team, including
members of our senior management, and promptly undertook a number of initiatives to safeguard our employees
and reduce our operating costs while ensuring the continuity of our operations and minimizing operational
disruptions. In particular, we successfully transitioned a portion of our corporate employees to remote working
over a short period of time, with a peak in the second quarter of 2020, while at the same time maintaining the full
operation of all our facilities. We also published specific COVID-19 guidelines for our employees and
implemented an internal tracking system to monitor the impact of the virus on employees. We estimate that in the
year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred approximately €0.4 million of costs associated with the transitioning
of our workforce to remote working and the adherence to social distancing, cleaning and other health and safety
guidance related to COVID-19.

While our market leading position, flexible cost structure and exposure to attractive and resilient
end-markets has so far allowed us to limit the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, COVID-19
has been evolving rapidly and we are unable to predict how the outbreak may affect our business in the future.
We continue to monitor the situation to ensure the safety of our employees, react to any operational
developments, logistics disruptions and macroeconomic fluctuations and assess the ongoing impact of
developments on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We expect our
operations to continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic for the foreseeable future and will continue to
take the necessary steps to protect our employees and mitigate the risk to our business. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Market and Our Business—The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have an adverse impact on_
_our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, which may be material.”_

**_The Transactions_**

In addition, following completion of the Transactions, our capital structure will include €750.0 million
aggregate principal amount of Notes. As a result, the aggregate outstanding amount of our indebtedness
(including lease liabilities under IFRS 16) will increase from €468.7 million as of December 31, 2020 to €773.7
million as of December 31, 2020, after giving effect to the Transactions. See “Capitalization.” We estimate that
as a result of the Transactions our annual cash interest payment obligations will increase. As of December 31,
2020, we had total lease liabilities of €23.5 million, of which €8.4 million were payable in less than one year,
€10.8 million were payable in between one and five years and €4.4 million were payable in more than five years.

**Key Line Items in Our Consolidated Statements of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income**

The following is a brief description of the key net sales and expenses that are included in the line items of
our consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

**_Net Sales_**

Our net sales are primarily derived from the sale of wood-based products and resins. Net sales are measured
based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Group recognizes net sales when it
transfers control over a good or service to a customer. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to
which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer,
excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example, some sales taxes). The consideration
promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts or both. Net sales from
provision of services include mainly net sales from transportation services, which are recognized when a service
is completed (meaning when items are delivered to the recipient).

For additional details on our net sales recognition policy, please see “—Critical Accounting Policies and
_Estimates—Net sales from sales of finished goods/merchandise and services under IFRS 15” and note 3 to the_
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales comprises the acquisition and production costs incurred for the products and merchandise sold.
These include primarily the costs of raw materials, energy, direct and indirect manufacturing labor, the costs of
consumables and supplies related to the acquisition and production process, as well as depreciation and
amortization and expenses for repair and maintenance material and services.

**_Selling Expenses_**

Selling expenses are expenses related to the marketing, sales and distribution of our products. They include
expenses for outbound cargo, labor costs for front and back-office sales staff and marketing personnel. These

Foreign currency gains and losses are presented on a net basis as either finance income or finance costs or in
other income if relate to operating foreign exchange differences.

**_Result of income tax_**

Result of income tax comprises current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in profit or loss
except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and
any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or
receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related
to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Subject to certain exceptions, deferred tax is recognized in respect of all temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for tax purposes and the amounts recognized in the consolidated
statement of financial position. Deferred tax related to transactions recognized directly in equity is recognized in
equity.

For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, current and deferred income taxes incurred by the Issuer
were included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of the DPLTA between the Issuer and the
Parent, the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries located in Germany (other than Heller Holz GmbH) became
part of the Parent’s tax group for German corporate income and trade tax purposes with effect from January 1,
2020. Pursuant to the DPLTA, the Issuer will be required to transfer its entire annual accounting profits and
losses to the Parent. As a result of the DPLTA, commencing with the year ending December 31, 2020, the
German taxable profits of the Issuer and its subsidiaries that are part of the tax group are allocated to the Parent,
which will be subject to German trade taxes and potentially will fund German corporate income taxes at the level

of the limited partners of the Parent. As a result, we did not record any result of German corporate income and
trade tax, in each case including current and deferred tax, relating to the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries
located in Germany (other than Heller Holz GmbH) in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended
December 31, 2020. Accordingly, the result of income tax for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in our
Consolidated Financial Statements only consists of corporate income tax relating to our Silekol division, Heller
Holz GmbH and our entities located outside of Germany. For further details regarding the DPLTA and the
related tax payments, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—The Domination and Profit
and Loss Transfer Agreement.”

Net sales decreased by €52.9 million, or 6.4%, from €829.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 to
€776.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to lower sales prices as
result of decreased raw material prices, which we partially passed through to our customers, as well as a decrease
in sales volumes in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our sales volumes started
to recover beginning with the third quarter 2020 and in the fourth quarter of 2020 exceeded our sales volume for
the same period in 2019.

(3) Represents the elimination upon consolidation of net sales between our two divisions.

Engineered Wood Products

Net sales decreased by €41.0 million, or 5.6%, from €728.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 to
€687.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a €27.0 million
decrease in sales prices mainly due to a decrease in raw material prices, which we partially passed through to our
customers, as well as a decrease in sales volumes of 2.6% as a result of the temporary shutdown of the
production facilities of some of our key customers in the kitchen and furniture industries in Germany and Poland
in the second quarter of 2020 due to the implementation of lockdown orders in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. Our sales volumes started to recover beginning with the third quarter 2020 and in the fourth quarter of
2020 exceeded our sales volume for the same period in 2019.

Silekol

Net sales decreased by €19.0 million, or 13.6%, from €140.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019
to €121.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sales
prices of €13.3 million, or 9.5%, primarily as result of decreased raw material prices, which we partially passed
through to our customers, as well as a 3.4% decrease in sales volumes as a result of the temporary shutdown of
the production facilities of some of our key customers in the wood-based panel production, packaging,
construction and building materials industries in the second quarter of 2020 due to the implementation of
lockdown orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our sales volumes started to recover beginning with
the third quarter 2020 and in the fourth quarter of 2020 exceeded our sales volume for the same period in 2019.

_Cost of Sales_

Total cost of sales decreased by €59.4 million, or 9.7%, from €613.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €554.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a
decrease in raw materials of €47.2 million resulting from lower prices for wood and chemicals, a €4.3 million
decrease in energy costs due to higher supplier payments for burning material, as well as the implementation of
our material efficiency initiatives and our comprehensive headcount reduction program. The decrease was
partially offset by an increase of depreciation and amortization of €2.9 million.

_Selling Expenses_

Selling Expenses decreased by €3.6 million, or 3.1%, from €116.8 million in the year ended December 31,
2019 to €113.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a €2.9 million
decrease in freight out expenses driven by lower sales volume as well as the positive impact from our logistics
cost reduction programs.

_R&D Expenses_

R&D expenses decreased by €0.3 million, or 17.6%, from €1.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2019 to €1.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to lower personnel
expenses and lower service expenses for technical advisory services.

_General and Administrative Expenses_

General and administrative expenses decreased by €0.6 million, or 1.8%, from €32.6 million in the year
ended December 31, 2019 to €32.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily
due to significant one-off severance expenses in 2019 as well as the positive impact from our SG&A headcount
reduction initiatives.

91


-----

_Other Operating Income and Expenses_

Other operating income and expenses decreased by €9.0 million, or 78.9%, from an expense of
€11.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 to an expense of €2.4 million in the year ended December 31,
2020. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in consulting costs incurred in connection with our cost
saving initiatives and restructuring costs.

_Result of Income Tax_

The following table shows our income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Result of income tax decreased by €9.6 million, or 79.3%, from €12.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €2.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the
fact that with effect from January 1, 2020, the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries located in Germany (other
than Heller Holz GmbH) became part of the Parent’s tax group for income tax purposes and, accordingly, we did
not record any result of income tax, including current and deferred tax, relating to the Issuer and its consolidated
subsidiaries located in Germany (other than Heller Holz GmbH) in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the
year ended December 31, 2020.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €8.3 million, or 6.8%, from €122.8 million in the year ended December 31,
2019 to €131.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the impact of
our cost saving initiatives and the overall net positive pass-through in our Engineered Wood Products division,
with sales price decreases that were relatively lower than declining raw material prices, which offset the decrease
in net sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The table below shows our Adjusted EBITDA by division for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020,
respectively:

Engineered Wood Products

Adjusted EBITDA in our Engineered Wood Products division increased by €4.6 million, or 4.2%, from
€109.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 to €113.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
This increase was primarily due to cost savings of €19.4 million realized in 2020 resulting from the ongoing
implementation of our cost saving and price improvement initiatives (included in price pass-through), and a net
pass-through of raw material costs, with sales price decreases that were relatively lower than declining raw
material prices, which offset the decrease in net sales volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Silekol

Adjusted EBITDA in our Silekol division increased by €3.7 million, or 26.8%, from €13.8 million in the
year ended December 31, 2019 to €17.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was
primarily due to improved customer mix and variable and fixed cost savings, which offset lower sales volumes
and led to higher contribution margins.

sales from our Engineering Wood Products division, while sales volumes from our Silekol division remained at a
stable level due to increased inter-divisional sales compared to sales to external customers.

Engineered Wood Products

Net sales decreased by €28.8 million, or 3.8%, from €757.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to
€728.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a €13.9 million
decrease in sales volumes, mainly resulting from the temporary interruption of the operations at our Baruth plant
due to a fire accident in 2019, a decrease in sales of MCF color products as well as a decrease in sales prices of
€12.8 million as a result of decreasing raw materials prices, which we partially passed on to our customers.
Excluding the decrease in sales volumes resulting from the fire at our Baruth plant, total net sales in the year
ended December 31, 2019 would have decreased by €20.5 million, or 2.7%.

Silekol

Net sales decreased by €6.3 million, or 4.3%, from €146.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to
€140.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a €8.1 million decrease
in the sale prices for our resin products, which was due to a decline in raw material prices, mainly methanol and
melamine, which was slightly offset by an increase in sale volumes.

_Cost of Sales_

Total cost of sales decreased by €23.6 million, or 3.7%, from €637.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018 to €613.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a
decrease in raw materials costs of €38.0 million resulting from lower prices for wood and chemicals, partially
offset by an increase of depreciation and amortization of €4.5 million.

_Selling Expenses_

Selling Expenses increased by €0.1 million, or 0.1%, from €116.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2018 to €116.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.

_R&D Expenses_

R&D expenses increased by €0.3 million, or 21.4%, from €1.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018
to €1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in services
costs related to the external audit of our Engineered Wood Products division and an increase in R&D expenses at
our facility in Neumarkt.

_General and Administrative Expenses_

General and administrative expenses increased by €2.4 million, or 7.9%, from €30.2 million in the year
ended December 31, 2018 to €32.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due
to an increase in services costs related to IT and legal services as well as an increase in consulting fees and higher
personnel costs, which was mainly driven by one-off severance expenses.

_Other Operating Income and Expenses_

Other operating income and expenses increased by €9.5 million from an expense of €1.9 million in the year
ended December 31, 2018 to an expense of €11.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was
primarily due to an increase in costs incurred in connection with our cost saving initiatives as well as
restructuring costs.

_Result of Income Tax_

The following table shows our income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Result of income tax decreased by €6.5 million, or 34.9%, from an expense of €18.6 million in the year
ended December 31, 2018 to an expense of €12.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease
was primarily due to a reduction in net profit in 2019 and the payment in 2018 of tax arrears in connection with
the tax audit for the years 2010 to 2015.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €3.6 million, or 2.8%, from €126.4 million in the year ended December 31,
2018 to €122.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due a decrease in sales
volumes in our Engineered Wood Products division.

The table below shows our Adjusted EBITDA by division for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019,
respectively:

Engineered Wood Products

Adjusted EBITDA in our Engineered Wood Products division decreased by €3.9 million, or 3.5%, from
€112.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to €109.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.
This decrease was primarily due to a decline in sales volumes.

Silekol

Adjusted EBITDA in our Silekol division slightly increased by €0.2 million, or 1.5%, from €13.6 million in
the year ended December 31, 2018 to €13.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA in
our Silekol division was supported primarily by procurement improvements, fixed and variable costs efficiency
initiatives as well as higher sales volumes, which offset lower prices for chemicals.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Historically, our primary source of liquidity has been our cash flows from operations as well as the Existing
Revolving Credit Facilities, amounts drawn under our Engineered Wood Products division’s securitization
program, which currently provides for a financing volume of up to €60 million, and amounts drawn under our
Silekol division’s factoring facility, which currently provides for a financing volume of up to PLN 40 million.
Pursuant to our Engineered Wood Products divisions’ securitization program, certain companies within
Pfleiderer sell eligible receivables to Silvertower, our securitization counterparty, on a weekly basis. This
securitization program is non-recourse (with the exception of certain purchase price reductions retained to
minimize risk for the buyer of our receivables). As of December 31, 2020, we had sold €29 million of accounts
receivables under our Engineered Wood Products division’s securitization program. Pursuant to our Silekol
division’s factoring facility, we sell receivables to Bank Millennium S.A. on a bi-weekly basis. This factoring
facility is non-recourse (with the exception of certain purchase price reductions retained to minimize risk for the
buyer of our receivables). As of December 31, 2020, we had sold €2 million of accounts receivables under our
Silekol division’s securitization program. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Securitization
_Program” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Factoring Facility.” Our primary cash needs_
relate to capital and other expenditures, maintaining and refurbishing our production facilities, manufacturing
equipment and fleet of trucks and meeting debt service requirements. Our ability to generate cash depends on our
future operating performance, which in turn depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry and
other factors, many of which are beyond our control, discussed in “ —Key Factors Affecting Results of
_Operations” and “Risk Factors.”_

In order to preserve quick access to liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily drew amounts
available for borrowing under our Existing Euro-denominated Revolving Credit Facility, which we subsequently
repaid in full during the third quarter of 2020, and as of December 31, 2020, no amounts were outstanding under
our Existing Euro-denominated Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the Transactions, we will repay
and cancel our Existing Euro-denominated Revolving Credit Facility and put in place the New Revolving Credit

95


-----

Facility, which will provide for borrowings of up to €65.0 million to service our working capital and general
corporate needs. The availability of this facility is dependent upon certain conditions described further under
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” The New
Revolving Credit Facility provides for revolving loans in an amount up to €65.0 million and will mature fifty
four (54) months years after the Issue Date. We expect the New Revolving Credit Facility to be undrawn on the
Issue Date.

We believe that, based on our current cash flows, our sources of liquidity, together with borrowings under
the New Revolving Credit Facility, are sufficient to mitigate the potential risk that could arise from the
COVID-19 pandemic and will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital expenditure and debt service for at
least the next twelve months. We cannot, however, assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash
flows from operating activities, that the currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be
realized, or that future borrowings will be available under our securitization program, our factoring facility or our
New Revolving Credit Facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our
other liquidity needs.

**_Cash Flows_**

_Reported Cash Flows_

Our principal sources of funds have been cash generated from our operating activities. Our principal uses of
cash are to fund capital expenditures, working capital and debt service obligations. Our historical consolidated
statement of cash flows reflects the effects on our cash flows from historical cash pooling arrangements with our
Parent and Panel East by way, amongst others, of intercompany loans, affecting in particular our net cash (used
in)/provided by investing activities as well as our net cash (used in)/provided financing activities, including
payments made in the context of the financing of the take private of our Parent by the Sponsor and the
optimization of our corporate structure. We unwound these intercompany loans and intercompany transactions in
connection with the optimization of our corporate structure in the year ended December 31, 2020. In this offering
memorandum, we also present and discuss our Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the years ended December 31, 2018,
2019 and 2020, which excludes the effects of such intercompany transactions, which we consider to be largely
exceptional, on our cash flows. We believe Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a useful metric for investors to
understand our cash flows resulting from our operating activities. See “—Adjusted Free Cash Flow.”

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by €9.7 million, or 8.2%, from €118.0 million in the
year ended December 31, 2019 to €108.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was
primarily due to (i) an increase in trade and other receivables of €22.2 million in the year ended December 31,
2019 compared to a decrease in trade and other receivables of €6.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020,
an increase in inventories of €10.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an increase in
inventories of €0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and a decrease in trade and other payables of
€9.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a decrease in trade and other payables of €0.4
million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and (ii) a decrease in income tax paid of €3.6 million, all of which
were partly offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization of €4.7 million and an increase in net profit of
€24.0 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by €41.7 million, or 54.9%, from €76.3 million in the
year ended December 31, 2018 to €118.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to (i) a decrease in trade and other receivables of €0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018
compared to an increase in trade and other receivables of €22.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, a
decrease in inventories of €12.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to an increase in
inventories of €10.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and a decrease in trade and other payables of

96


-----

€3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a decrease in trade and other payables of €9.4
million in the year ended December 31, 2019, and (ii) a decrease in income tax paid in an amount of €15.2
million and an increase in depreciation and amortization of €4.5 million, all of which were partly offset by a
decrease in net profit of €20.8 million.

Net Cash (Used in)/Provided by Investing Activities

Net cash provided by/(used in) in investing activities changed by €79.8 million, or 133.4%, from an inflow
of €59.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 to an outflow of €20.0 million in the year ended December
31, 2020. Our cash payments for capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2020 were slightly lower
(€43.2 million) than our cash payments for capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2019 (€46.2
million). In the year ended December 31, 2020, Silekol exited the Panel East cash pooling arrangement and
received a repayment of €15.7 million of funds advanced to the cash pool. Additionally, the loan granted by our
Engineered Wood Products division to Panel East in the year ended December 31, 2019 in the amount of €3.1
million was repaid. In addition, our Engineered Wood Products division paid a dividend to the Parent in the
amount of €10.0 million (net of tax) (presented in financing activities), which was partially set off against an
intercompany loan granted to the Parent in 2015 in the amount of €7.4 million. In addition, our Engineered Wood
Products division provided €4.8 million of funds to the Parent via our existing cash pooling arrangements.

Net cash provided by/(used in) in investing activities changed by €197.7 million, or 143.4% from an outflow
of €137.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to an inflow of €59.8 million in the year ended December
31, 2019. Our cash payments for capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2019 were lower (€46.2
million) than our cash payments for capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2018 (€64.3 million). In
the year ended December 31, 2019, our Parent repaid certain intercompany loans owed to our Engineered Wood
Panels division with a principal amount of €117.2 million and interest of €8.3 million, which repayment took
place in the form of a set off against a capital repayment of €125.0 million (presented in financing activities) paid
by our Engineered Wood Panels division to the Parent. In the year ended December 31, 2019, Silekol joined the
Panel East cash pool providing €15.7 million funds, which were subsequently repaid in 2020. Additionally, our
Engineered Wood Products division granted a short-term intercompany loan in the amount of €3.1 million to
Panel East segment to increase Panel East’s liquidity. This loan was subsequently repaid in 2020. In the year
ended December 31, 2018, our Engineered Wood Products division granted two intercompany loans to the Parent
for the purposes of share buy-backs, which amount to €15.0 million (funded with own funds) and €95.0 million
(funded with an external loan), respectively (presented in financing activities).

In the year ended December 31, 2018, the Parent repaid an intercompany loan owed to our Engineered
Wood Products division, which was set off against a dividend paid by our Engineered Wood Products division to
our Parent in the amount of €26.7 million (presented in financing activities). In addition, Silekol paid a dividend
in the amount of €12.7 million to Pfleiderer Polska Sp. z o.o. (presented in financing activities). In addition, our
Engineered Wood Products division received a cash repayment of an outstanding intercompany loan in the
amount of €6.0 million.

Net Cash Provided by/(Used in) Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by €123.2 million, or 74.0%, from €166.5 million in the year
ended December 31, 2019 to €43.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily
due to distribution of capital reserves in the amount of €125.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and
lower interest paid in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities changed by €191.4 million from a cash inflow of €24.9
million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to a cash outflow of €166.5 million in the year ended December 31,
2019. This change was primarily attributed to distribution of capital reserves in the amount of €125.0 million in
the year ended December 31, 2019 and higher interest paid in the year ended December 31, 2020. The dividend
in the year 2019 was paid by Silekol to Pfleiderer Polska Sp. z o.o.

_Adjusted Free Cash Flow_

(i) Relates primarily to a different classification of certain line items in our historical consolidated cash flow statement as well as
certain foreign exchange movements.

Adjusted Free Cash flow in the year ended December 31, 2018 was €18.6 million. Our Adjusted Free Cash
Flow in the year ended December 31, 2018 was negatively affected by limited working capital management
leading to a high level of inventories and a low level of trade payables as well as subsequent tax payments.

Adjusted Free Cash flow in the year ended December 31, 2019 was €94.0 million. Our Adjusted Free Cash
Flow in the year ended December 31, 2019 improved because of the reduction of our high levels of inventory
built up in 2018 as well as the implementation of more favorable payment terms with Panel East, which lead to a
one-off inflow of cash in the year ended December 31, 2019.

Adjusted Free Cash flow in the year ended December 31, 2020 was €71.0 million. Our Adjusted Free Cash
Flow in the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects normalized levels of inventory during the year and did not
benefit from the one-off inflow of cash that we experienced in the year ended December 31, 2019.

**_Trade Working Capital_**

We monitor and constantly attempt to optimize the level of working capital.

The level of our inventories is primarily affected by our expectations on sales projections and the amounts
required to ensure prompt delivery to our customers. We closely manage our inventory levels and we also take
into consideration certain production processes, such as efficiency optimizations and facility standstills during

98


-----

vacation periods or for scheduled maintenance work. Strategic purchases of larger quantities of raw materials,
such as before previously announced price increases by our suppliers become effective, may temporarily increase
inventory levels. Inventories are also affected by our need to increase our stock of wood-based materials for the
winter months and they typically decrease in the fourth quarter due to the holiday period. For these reasons, the
development of inventory levels does not necessarily mirror net sales development to the same degree as trade
payables and, particularly, trade accounts receivable.

Trade accounts receivable generally develop in line with the development of net sales on a trailing basis. We
monitor the terms of trade with our customers, with the main focus on generating net sales with acceptable
payment conditions, which also depend on country-specific patterns in the behavior of our customers that we
may need to accommodate. In particular, we focus on keeping our customer payment terms relatively short to
match our supplier terms. In addition, to efficiently manage our working capital needs, we sell approximately
70% of our trade receivables to factoring providers under full non-recourse factoring arrangements and our
Securitization Program. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have seen only a limited impact on our
trade accounts receivable arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in relation to accounts receivables
from customers located in countries other than Germany, which has to date not resulted in a significant ageing of
our trade receivables. Starting in the second half of 2020, we have seen a positive recovery of previously overdue
accounts receivable. In addition, we maintain insurance coverage for the vast majority of our trade accounts
receivables.

The following information is a summary of our historical unaudited trade working capital as derived from
the Consolidated Financial Statements and the internal reporting system.

We define “capital expenditures” as (a) additions to property, plant and equipment plus (b) additions to
intangible assets excluding emission rights plus (c) change in advances paid on fixed assets.

We define maintenance capital expenditures as (a) capital expenditures used primarily for maintenance,
replacement and overhaul of plant and equipment, which is predominantly intended to maintain plant and
equipment in good working order and conditions but not to increase production capacity or optimize
productivity, (b) capitalized expenditures relating to our information technology systems, as well as (c) capital
expenditures incurred to comply with applicable rules, laws and regulations, whether environmental or otherwise,
including but not limited to capitalized expenditures associated with the application for environmental permits
and licenses and the use, handling, disposal of or exposure to chemicals and hazardous substances (including
waste and waste water) and the control of atmospheric and water pollution (“regulatory capital expenditures”).

Growth & efficiency capital expenditures primarily comprise (a) capital expenditures made in connection
with maximizing the productivity of existing production capacities and reducing manufacturing or other costs
through efficiency improvement programs (“efficiency capital expenditures”) as well as (b) capital expenditures
made in connection with expanding production capacities (“growth capital expenditures”); and (c) capital
expenditures used to reduce carbon emissions, increase the share of recycled wood used in our manufacturing
processes or otherwise reduce the impact of our activities on the environment above and beyond the requirements
of applicable rules, laws and regulations (“environmental capital expenditures”).

We incurred €57.8 million, €46.6 million and €42.8 million of capital expenditures in the years ended 2018,
2019 and 2020, respectively, of which €27.6 million (3.2% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018),
€27.9 million (3.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019) and €30.2 million (3.9% of net sales for
the year ended December 31, 2020), respectively, related to maintenance capital expenditures and €30.2 million
(3.5% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018), €18.6 million (2.3% of net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2019) and €12.6 million (1.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020), respectively
related to growth & efficiency capital expenditures. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have
strategically reduced our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020.

While we believe our production facilities are generally in good condition and adequate for our existing
needs, we will continue to invest in our production facilities in order to improve productivity, product quality and
energy efficiency as well as to expand capacity, if necessary, to meet demand for our existing and potential new
products. As we continue to invest in the improvement and optimization of our production facilities, capital

expenditures may increase. However, subject to further development of markets and economies in general,
including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our business in particular, we expect that capital
expenditures in 2021 will remain close to the level of 2020 and we do not expect to make any significant capital
expenditures during that time that could not be financed from current cash flows.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not have any other relationships with
unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or
special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or
other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In
addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.

**Employee benefit obligations**

In addition to the obligations shown in the table under “—Contractual Obligations,” we have employeebenefit obligations. We operate unfunded defined benefit pension schemes for beneficiaries. As of December 31,
2020, we had total employee-benefit obligations of €54.3 million, which were entirely unfunded.

We grant our employees performance-based pension plans on a case-by-case basis, however, we are subject
to obligations from certain performance-based pension plans that were previously approved under several
pension regulations and which include age, invalidity and survivor benefits. Our defined benefit obligations are
based on different factors that differ by plan, including pay at retirement, fixed amounts, seniority, certain
actuarial and underlying assumptions in Germany, including discount rates, life expectancies and rates of
increase in compensation levels. Additionally, under German law, pension obligations are required to be adjusted
in line with the development of the general consumer price index. As pension obligations are required to be
adjusted according to changes in these factors, such pension obligations are subject to change. We closed our
pension funds to new entrants in 1986, so we expect these pension obligations will decrease with time.

If actual results, especially discount rates or life expectancies were to differ from our underlying and
actuarial assumptions, our pension obligations could be higher or lower than expected and we could incur
remeasurements (gains or losses). Changes in all assumptions could also adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations. Differences between the discount rate can require us to record additional
remeasurements.

For more information on our employee benefits obligations, see note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Environmental Obligations**

As of December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we did not recognize any provisions for environmental
obligations. As we are currently not expecting to close any additional production facilities, we do not require
making provisions for potential recultivation obligations and costs related to environmental damages at
abandoned production sites.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

**_Liquidity Risk_**

In addition to the management of interest rate and currency risks, liquidity management represents a key
element of our financial management. The goal of the liquidity management is to protect us from insolvency. We
mitigate our liquidity risks by entering into credit facilities, such as the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, and by ensuring customer diversification to avoid material cash-flow disruptions. In addition, we
plan any extraordinary capital expenditures well in advance and consider any such expenditures when managing
our liquidity.

**_Currency Exchange Rate Exposure_**

We are exposed to currency risk mainly to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in
which trade transactions, purchases of materials and merchandise and borrowings are denominated and the
respective functional currencies of our Group companies. The functional currencies of our Group companies are
primarily the euro and the Polish zloty. The main currencies in which foreign currency transactions are
denominated are euro, U.S. dollars and British pound sterling.

101


-----

The objective of currency risk management is to minimize losses arising out of unfavorable changes in
foreign exchange rates. We monitor our currency position from the point of view of cash flows. To manage our
currency risk, we first rely on natural hedging and, where necessary, use forward contracts. The time horizon
adopted for position monitoring and hedging transactions is analyzed on a case by case basis. In particular, we
use forward contracts to hedge currency risk related to commercial transactions, mainly the export of goods. The
forward contracts used to hedge our commercial transactions in the Silekol division consist of the sale of euros at
pre-determined rates, which helps secure our margins on export sales and mitigate the risk of adverse changes
due to the appreciation of the Polish zloty.

We estimate that a hypothetical 5% change in the exchange rate of a foreign currency versus the euro and
the Polish zloty, could have the net effect of reducing or increasing our profit/(loss) before tax for the year ended
December 31, 2020 by approximately €0.3 million.

**_Commodity Price Risk_**

Commodity price risk refers to the risk that we will not be able to purchase the raw materials needed for our
operations on favorable commercial terms, or at all. In the year ended December 31, 2020, raw materials and
energy costs accounted for €364.5 million, or 71%, of our total cost of sales (excluding depreciation and
amortization). As a result changes in raw material prices and our ability to pass any price increases to our
customers have a material impact on our net sales and profitability.

**_Interest Rate Risks_**

Upon the consummation of the offering of the Notes and the application of proceeds therefrom in
accordance with the description set forth under “Use of Proceeds”, the total aggregate principal amount of the
Floating Rate Notes and up to €65.0 million available to be drawn under the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement will bear interest at a floating rate.

Interest rate risks result from such debt, since the basis interest rates in EURIBOR are variable. Central
interest rate management has the objective to manage and minimize the interest rate change risks. For this
purpose, interest rate trends are regularly analyzed as a part of our management of interest rate risk.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we do not hedge interest rate risk on a group level and as of
December 31, 2020, there were no interest rate hedging transactions.

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from our receivables from customers. We sell a
wide range of products to numerous industrial and commercial customers in and outside of Germany. A
concentration of credit risk related to payment obligations against our customers is minimized due to the high
number of customers that we have. During the reporting period, we did not have any single customer that
contributed a significant share to our overall net sales. We invest our cash reserves in cash at bank on current
accounts with commercial banks with high short-term credit ratings and other high-value financial investments
that can be liquidated upon short notice. We monitor our credit risk through regular evaluations of the credit
ratings of our investments. We also operate a strict receivables management policy, whereby the risk of customer
insolvency is mitigated through the use of trade credit insurance and factoring (in the case of our Silekol
division) and an asset-backed commercial paper program (in the case of our Engineered Wood Products
division).

As of December 31, 2020, 95% of our trade receivables (85% as of December 31, 2019 and 87% as of
December 31, 2018) were covered by insurance policies. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020,
we did not incur any significant losses due to customer defaults. We recognize allowances for impairment losses
with respect to uninsured receivables and amounts corresponding to the relevant deductibles under our insurance
policies, based on a detailed impairment analysis of accounts receivable. Our total credit risk exposure as of
December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 was €294.7 million, €188.1 million and €136.5 million, respectively. In
addition, based on the country risk and the credit loss experience over the past years, we estimate that our credit
loss percentage is between 1% and up to 3% of our total trade receivables, excluding receivables sold through
factorings.

**Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements**

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the IASB or other standard setting bodies
that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. We believe that the adoption of these new standards did
not have a significant impact on our financial statements. Please refer to our Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information on recently issued accounting
standards and our plans for adoption of those standards.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, management has made judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of our accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.

**INDUSTRY**

**_Overview_**

We are active in the wood panel and laminates market with a focus on value-added products. Our product
offering covers all major market segments of the broader wood panel and laminates market, including Raw
Chipboard (RCB), Medium-Density and High-Density Fiberboard (MDF / HDF), Melamine-Faced Board (MFB),
High-Pressure Laminate (HPL) and Lacquered board. We have a focus on the DACH region and selected export
markets, in particular the UK and France. Across the regions in which we are active we target premium customers
in the kitchen, living furniture and construction end-markets. In 2020, 78% of our gross sales was generated by
value-add or high value-add products, which generate superior margins compared to our basic products.

The wood panel and laminates market in Western Europe has a favorable industry structure and a
sustainable growth outlook. Our addressable market in DACH, the UK and France is sizable with an estimated
size of €4.6 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 4-5% CAGR to €5.7 billion by 2025, driven by secular
trends, including to home improvement, premiumization and sustainable construction.

The wood panel and laminates market in Europe is highly consolidated, with the top 3 players accounting
for 49% of the market. We are the number two player in both basic and value-added products. The industry
enjoys high utilization rates and has benefitted from disciplined capacity management over the last decade. High
barriers to entry further support the industry structure.

**_Product Offering_**

MFB accounts for the largest share of our addressable market value (40-45%), followed by HPL (25-30%).
Both types of product are classified as either value-added or high value-added products. RCB and MDF / HDF
account for 15-20% and 10-15% of the market, respectively, and are classified as either basic or value-added
products depending on their specifications.

Value-added products are engineered wood-based products which have been given surface treatments (for
example, a white melamine surface), moderate functionality improvements (for example, stress and moisture
resistance, bending strength or fire protection) and decorative features. Like high value-added products, valueadded products are frequently “made to order” to meet customer requirements for specific applications. As a
result, they are more difficult to substitute than basic products and exhibit a more stable price and demand
pattern.

High value-added products are engineered wood-based products, which have been given advanced surface
treatment (including, for example, lacquered or colored melamine surface treatments), significant functionality
improvements (including, for example, anti-fingerprint features, impact resistance qualities and ease of care
improvements) and a wide variety of decorative designs and finishes. A key characteristic of this category is the
frequent made to-order nature of these products. This results in demand stability, price stability and visibility of
future revenues. The “made-to-order” nature of value-added products also tends to limit the rate of customer
attrition. Further, customers of high value-added products tend to be relatively less sensitive to price increases as
the cost of these products represent a smaller percentage of their total budget, as compared to customers of basic
products.

The production process of value-added and high value-added products is complex and requires a high level
of know-how and experience, as well as dedicated facilities which are expensive to set up and require special
permits. The key product offerings sorted by the amount of value-add are as follows:

_Raw chipboard (RCB)_

RCB accounts for 15-20% of the market and for 16% of the gross sales in our Engineered Wood Products
division during the year ended December 31, 2020. RCB is an alternative to solid wood and manufactured by
mixing particles or flakes of wood or jute-stick together with a resin, forming the mixture into a sheet. It is
lighter, better to work with and has more constant properties compared with solid wood. The largest end-market
for RCB is the construction industry, where it is typically used for doors, roofs and walls. The second largest
end-market is the furniture market, where RCB is typically used as base material for shelves and furniture
structures. Depending on its specifications, RCB is classified as basic product or value-added product, with
approximately equal shares among our sales. Growth in the product type is driven by a growing furniture
end-market and increased usage in the construction industry, replacing oriented strand board (OSB) driven by
price, functional and ecological advantages. The annual industry RCB utilization in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020,
was 96%, 98%, 96% and 94%, respectively.

_Medium-high density fiberboard (MDF / HDF)_

MDF / HDF accounts for 10-15% of the market and for 14% of the gross sales in our Engineered Wood
Products division during the year ended December 31, 2020. MDF / HDF is manufactured from wood fibers and
resin and exists in different medium and high density options. The largest end-market for MDF / HDF is the
construction industry, where it is typically used for roofs and doors. The second largest end-market is the
furniture market where it is used as base material for furniture fronts and table tops. Raw MDF / HDF is
classified as basic product, while lacquered HDF is classified as value-added product. Growth in the product type
is mostly driven by growth in the furniture end-market.

_Melamine-faced board (MFB)_

MFB is the largest product in our addressable market, accounting for 40-50% of the market size and for
44% of the gross sales in our Engineered Wood Products division during the year ended December 31, 2020.
MFB is a decorative wood panel based on RCB/MDF/HDF laminated with melamine-impregnated paper surfaces
with various formats and features. Melamine-faced chipboard is commonly referred to as MFC. The largest
end-market for MFB by far is the kitchen industry, accounting for more than 50% of demand. Key applications in
the kitchen industry are furniture fronts and furniture carcass. The second largest end-market is the furniture
industry with applications for furniture fronts and table tops. The construction industry accounts for a small part
of the demand for MFB, with applications mostly for concrete formwork. Most MFB products are classified as
high value-added products, with only white MFC is classified as a value-added product. Growth in the product
category is driven by the increased usage of MFB in niche markets, alongside the structural growth in the
premium kitchen end-market.

_High-pressure laminate (HPL)_

HPL accounts for 25-30% of the market and for 23% of the gross sales in our Engineered Wood Products
division during the year ended December 31, 2020. HPL is considered one of the most durable decorative surface
materials and is available with special performance properties including chemical, fire and wear resistance. The
laminate coating is produced by fusing craft and decorative paper and can be used either in stand-alone capacity
or laminated to RCB / MDF. The largest end-markets for HPL are the kitchen and construction end-markets,
followed by furniture and special applications. Applications in the kitchen end-market include worktops and
kitchen fronts. In the construction end-market, HPL is used for facades and doors. Main applications in the
furniture end-market include furniture fronts and table tops. Growth in this products driven by the structurally
growing kitchen end-market, increased usage of HPL for construction and decorative facades as well as increased
usage in specific applications, such as balconies and paneling. HPL falls under the high-value added category.

_Lacquered boards_

Lacquered board is a niche product accounting for approximately 1% of the market and for approximately
2% of the gross sales in our Engineered Wood Products division during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Lacquered boards are the highest premium solution for vertical surfaces in furniture making and interior fixtures
and finishes. They consists of a lacquered surface that can be applied to various different wood panels (typically
either MFB or HPL). The largest end-market is the kitchen industry, where it is typically used for kitchen fronts.
In the furniture end-market it is used for furniture fronts and sliding doors, in the construction end-market main
applications include doors, facades and other outdoor applications. Growth is driven by positive substitution
trends as lacquered boards substitute foils and other aluminum materials. The product falls under the high value
added category.

Our addressable market has shown sustainable growth up to 2019 and was temporarily impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. A swift recovery of the market is expected in 2021, with the market size expected
to exceed 2019 levels during 2021. The growth of our addressable market is driven by multiple secular trends,
including the home improvement trend, the premiumization trend and the trend to more sustainable construction.
These long-term trends have been further reinforced by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in strong demand that
is expected to be sustained over the coming years.

Home improvement trend: More opportunities for remote connection and collaboration through digital
adoption have increased time spent at home even before the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the pandemic,
companies have adopted more flexible working models, allowing a large amount of employees to work from
home, with a ratio of up to 60% in Germany. It is expected that also after the pandemic employees will continue
to work from home more frequently than before, fueling the demand for new furniture and kitchens.

Premiumization: Increasing disposable income and growing importance of nutrition in daily lives drive
demand for customized and high-quality kitchens as center of the living space, driving positive mix effects
towards higher value-added products with high decorative value. Increased time spent at home following the
pandemic has further accelerated this trend.

Sustainable construction: The trend for more sustainable products and solutions is particularly pronounced
in the construction sector and wood as a sustainable material is expected to benefit significantly from this trend.
The German government offers subsidies of approximately €8 billion annually for sustainable buildings and the
European Green Deal is expected to further support sustainable construction and renovation. Wooden houses are
highly energy efficient in both construction and operation and their share within new built prefabricated
buildings in Germany has increased from 15% in 2010 to 20% in 2019 and is expected to increase to 25% by
2025, increasing the demand for wood panels in construction. Further it is expected that RCB will increasingly
substitute OSB in construction, driven by lower emission values of RCB. Within the kitchen and furniture
end-markets wood as a sustainable resource is expected to gain a larger share of the market for materials as
compared to non-sustainable materials, such as plastics.

**_End-markets_**

Key end-markets for the wood panel and laminates industry are the kitchen, furniture, construction and
wholesale end-markets, accounting for 28%, 18%, 19% and 31%, of gross sales in our Engineered Wood
Products division during the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. We benefit from our balanced
exposure to various end-markets and compensates its exposure towards the less growing living furniture

end-markets (e.g. commercial office, store and exhibition furniture) with above average exposure towards
attractive kitchen and prefabricated buildings end-markets.

Kitchen end-market: The kitchen end-market is an attractive market characterized by high-end products,
high margins structural growth and customer colocation. The German kitchen industry is home to a number of
premium kitchen manufacturers with strong reputation and customer recognition across Europe. A number of our
clients have invested in expanding their production capacities to drive growth in export markets, increasing
demand for wood panels and laminates in their home locations. The end-market also benefits from customer
co-location, with locations of key kitchen manufacturers clustered in certain regions in Germany, and our
manufacturing facilities being located closely to those regions. Volume growth in the kitchen end-market has
historically been at 2.6% CAGR (2015-19) and is expected to remain at similar levels going forward. In 2020, the
kitchen end-market has been highly resilient during the COVID-19 crisis with a volume increase of 4.5% vs.
prior year given the consumer spending shifts towards new kitchens (with further spill-over into 2021). In the
medium term, the German kitchen end-market is expected to gain further share in export markets while generally
profiting from a lifestyle trend towards higher kitchen spend.

Furniture end-market: The furniture end-market is characterized by high quality products, high margins and
customer colocation. Historically, the furniture end-market has benefitted from stable macroeconomic
development with increased salaries and building activities. In 2020, national store lockdowns negatively
impacted furniture spending in the first half of 2020, while the second half of 2020 showed good momentum,
mainly driven by catch-up effects and a shift in consumer spending from travelling and restaurants to furniture
spend. In 2021, the catch-up effect expected to continue, further intensified through sustained home improvement
trend. In the medium term, growth is expected to slightly exceed historic levels at approximately 2% annual
growth.

Construction end-market: The residential construction market benefits from low interest rates paired with
regional housing shortage, a lack of investment alternatives and a sharp rise in real income in recent years. In the
non-residential end-market favorable financing conditions for companies in the low interest rate environment
have boosted construction activity. Going forward, renovation is expected to grow stronger than new built
construction, driven by the sustainable construction trend and incentives for renovation activities. Further, the
prefabricated buildings end-market is expected to drive growth over the medium term. Volume growth in the
construction market is expected at 1.3% CAGR 2020-25 in residential construction and at a 0.9% CAGR
2020-25 in non-residential construction.

Within the construction end-market, we are mostly exposed to the renovation end-market (based on
management estimates, approximately 75% sales), which has been characterised by more resilient market growth
compared with new construction, driven by lower initial levels of investment required and minimum levels of
required renovation.

In addition to end-market volume growth, increasing penetration is expected to contribute up to 1% growth
in our addressable market. Penetration is mostly dependent upon consumer preferences of wood panel and

laminates products per application. We see a low substitution threat from other materials given the strong
characteristics, sustainable properties and competitive prices for end users. Some relevant characteristics to
highlight include the high stress and moisture resistance of both panels and laminates, the workability of the
materials (ability to prefabricate enables fast and cheap assembly of modules), sturdiness and weather resistance
(which is constantly improved via enhanced recipes), ease of care and hygiene (given anti-fingerprint surfaces
and edge-free worktops), variety of design options (multiple decors can be attached to wood panels to enrich
customer personalization) and sustainability and environmental protection (given all panels are based on wood –
a sustainable resource and CO2 storage). Wood as a sustainable resource is expected to gain a larger share of the
market for materials as compared to non-sustainable materials, such as plastics.

**_Pricing trend_**

Aside from raw material inflation, where we have achieved a successful track record of passing through
costs, we are expecting real prices to slightly increase going forward as a function of overall higher industry
utilization and the competitive pricing behavior resulting thereof. We are expecting the pricing spike in 2020 that
resulted from the supply / demand imbalance to flatten post 2021 as both RCB and MFC pricing settles around
unchanged to slight increases or decreases until 2025.

**_Industry Structure and Competitive Landscape_**

The supplier landscape is highly consolidated with the largest three engineered wood producers (Egger,
Kronospan and Pfleiderer) accounting for almost 50% of the installed capacity in DACH and the top five
producers accounting for 69% of market share. We are the number two player in both basic and value-add
products with a combined market share of approximately 14%.

**Approximated Revenue Units (2020, in mm m[2])**

There are significant barriers to entry in the industry, including high start-up capex requirements, customer
lock-in, feedstock supply and IP / technology.

Capex requirements: Upfront investments in manufacturing equipment and logistics are required to ensure
adherence to industry and customer standards (state-of-the-art equipment for value-add products and highly
automated basic products is approximately €300-500 million average investment for a new plant). In addition,
our business requires complex environmental permitting.

Customer lock-in: Large customers have a dependency on large scale suppliers to ensure consistent quality
among products and geographies. We believe our business to be a great beneficiary of such given our focus on
the premium and personalized end markets which has allowed for the development of strong customer
relationships over the years. The industry in general is very focused on customer proximity, geographically and
alike, to avoid risk of new entrants.

Feedstock supply: The supply of wood, chemicals and other raw materials requires market expertise and
established relations with suppliers – which incumbent players have invested strongly in throughout the years.
The number and sources of wood supply itself is limited (especially high quality sawdust for thin surfaces), and
the regional nature of wood supply market triggers sourcing complexity across the multiple geographies.
Furthermore, the industry has limited hedging scope to mix in wood basket and wood substitutes (e.g., spelt)
where possible.

IP/ Technology: The investment in R&D and co-development with customer critical differentiating factor
(esp. for high-end products) is crucial to drive innovative and competitive products and requires a vast degree of
technical knowledge.

**_Capacity and utilization rates_**

The industry has benefitted from stable capacity with high utilization rates over the last years.
Overcapacities that existed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis were substantially reduced by 2011, and
there has been a disciplined capacity development since with few additions over recent years, resulting in high
utilization rates consistently above 90%. This development coupled with an increasing share of high value-add
products in the market has supported margins in the industry that have substantially increased over the last ten
years.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

With an operating history of over 125 years, Pfleiderer is a leading manufacturer of premium engineered
wood products and laminates for fast-growing, high-end applications in the Western European kitchen, furniture
and construction end-markets. Pfleiderer is also a leading producer of industrial and specialty resins for sales to
Central and Eastern European customers and for internal use in our panel production.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated €776.7 million in net sales and €152.0 million in Pro
_Forma Adjusted EBITDA (19.3% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin) as well as €71.0 million in Adjusted_
Free Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 2,200 people, serving a loyal and
diversified customer base of over 1,700 customers.

Our business comprises two divisions, Engineered Wood Products and Silekol, which represented 89% and
11%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales in 2020. With a market share of 14% by net sales in 2020, our
Engineered Wood Products division is the second largest manufacturer of premium engineered wood products
and laminates in the DACH region, which comprises Germany, Europe’s largest wood panel market, as well as
Austria and Switzerland. Our Silekol division is the third largest resin manufacturer by volume in Central and
Eastern Europe.

We primarily produce value-added and high value-added engineered wood products, which accounted for
78% of gross sales from our Engineered Wood Products division in the year ended December 31, 2020. We sell
our premium engineered wood products predominantly to customers in the fast-growing premium kitchen and the
robust and growing furniture end-markets, which together generated approximately 60% of our Engineered
Wood Products division’s gross sales in the year ended December 31, 2020. In the year ended
December 31, 2020, 91% of the external gross sales of our Engineered Wood Products division were to
customers located in Western Europe, which has allowed us to benefit from stable and growing market
environments. We estimate that in the same year we generated approximately 75% of gross sales in our
Engineered Wood Products division from the renovation and replacement segment. The renovation and
replacement segment has historically been resilient to cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions and has
contributed to our stable revenue generation and gross margins.

Our leading market position and strong focus on attractive end-markets is supported by our efficient and
well-invested production facilities. Our Engineered Wood Products division operates five highly automated
manufacturing plants, which are strategically located across Germany in close proximity to our customers in our
key market, the DACH region. We believe that the close proximity of our plants to key customers in Germany
provides us with an important competitive advantage due to the limited ability to profitably transport engineered
wood products over long distances. Silekol’s resin production plant is located in Poland, which provides costefficient access to both Western and Central and Eastern European markets.

Our operations have historically generated industry-leading margins and free cash flow conversion and
benefit from a lean and flexible cost structure. The success of our business is underpinned by, among others, a
high share of higher-margin value- and high-value added products, economies of scale, a high degree of
automation, backward integration within both chemicals and electricity, as well as our as high share of recycled
wood usage, which helps reduce our raw material procurement costs.

We continuously strive to operate our business with a view to sustainability and protecting the environment,
which is well-aligned with our focus on high product quality, superior customer service, and staying at the
forefront of product innovation. In connection with the Offering, we adopted the Sustainability-Linked Financing
Framework, pursuant to which we have committed to increasing the Percentage of Recycled Wood Used in our
operations to at least 44% by the end of 2022 and 50% by the end of 2025, in each case from approximately 40%
in 2020. We have also committed to reduce our Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions to 201.7 kT by the end
of 2022 and to 173.9 kT by the end of 2025, in each case from 220.2 kT in 2020. Adopting the SustainabilityLinked Financing Framework will allow us to leverage our existing sustainability expertise to meet ambitious
timelines and targets to further improve our sustainability performance in a way that is relevant, core and
material to our business.

Historically, our Parent operated our business through three divisions: Engineered Wood Products, Silekol
and Panel East. Following the take-private of our Parent by SVPGlobal in September 2019, we have optimized
our corporate structure to focus on our core divisions, Engineered Wood Products and Silekol, which we are now
operating together through the Issuer. Panel East is being managed independently by our Parent. We believe that
these changes in our corporate structure have enabled us to focus on the core strengths of the Engineered Wood
Products and Silekol divisions and position us well for the next phase of our growth. In 2019 and 2020, our
management team also implemented a comprehensive series of cost savings and efficiency initiatives. These
initiatives, together with the optimization of our corporate structure, have allowed us to benefit from more
efficient operations, a highly flexible cost base and a stronger competitive profile in our premium end-markets.
All of this has strongly enhanced our credit profile as demonstrated by our resilient performance during the
recent COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Our Engineered Wood Products division is a leading wood panel and laminate producer in Western Europe.
Through this division, we focus on producing a broad range of value-added and high-value added engineered
wood products. We sell these products under the Pfleiderer, Duropal and Thermopal brands. We serve customers
primarily in the kitchen, furniture and construction end-markets. We focus primarily on the residential sector,
with a focus on the renovation and replacement segment, including shops, hotels, hospitals, nursing homes and
restaurants. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our Engineered Wood Products division generated net sales
of €687.9 million (including inter-division sales to our Silekol division). In the same year, our Engineered Wood
Products division generated Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €133.3 million, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
margin of 19.0% and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure margin of 14.6%.

Our Silekol division manufactures a full spectrum of resins, with a focus on specialty resins, which have
higher margins compared to industrial resins. In 2020, we sold our resins to over 200 external customers,
primarily in the German and Polish wood-based panel production, packaging, construction and building materials
industries. We also sell our resins to Panel East on an arm’s length basis. In addition, our Silekol division
operates as a vertically integrated in-house resins manufacturer and supplies resins to our Engineered Wood
Products division for use in manufacturing our engineered wood products, including on an exclusive basis for
certain products. We believe this gives us a competitive advantage in supply sourcing. For the year ended
December 31, 2020, our Silekol division generated net sales of €121.1 million (including inter-division sales to
our Engineered Wood Products division). In the same year, our Silekol division generated Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA of €18.7 million, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4% and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA

**Our Strengths**

**_Well-positioned in attractive Western European markets with exposure to structurally growing and resilient_**
**_end-markets with high barriers to entry_**

Following the optimization of our corporate structure in 2020, we are well-positioned as a leading supplier
of premium engineered wood products and laminates in attractive and growing end-markets in Western Europe.
This enables us to focus on achieving growth in our core business and benefit from more efficient operations. We
demonstrated this in 2020 when we meaningfully increased our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
margins despite the COVID-19 pandemic. We have grown our Adjusted EBITDA in every year since 2012, and
have achieved a 9.8% compound annualized growth rate during this period.

_Our core geographical markets have a strong and sustainable growth outlook driven by exposure to attractive_
_and resilient end-markets_

We primarily sell our premium engineered wood products and laminates into the DACH region, the United
Kingdom and France, which are our key addressable markets. According to third party reports, including a report
prepared for us by a leading international consulting firm, these markets had a total size of €4.6 billion in 2020,
of which the DACH region accounts for €2.9 billion. These markets are expected to grow at a CAGR of 4% to
5% to reach approximately €5.7 billion in 2025. This growth is expected to be driven primarily by strong growth
in the DACH region, supported by the fast-growing export markets in the United Kingdom and France. In the
year ended December 31, 2020, the DACH region, United Kingdom and France together accounted for
€486.3 million, or 75%, of our Engineered Wood Products division’s gross sales.

Growth in our core addressable markets in Western Europe is primarily driven by the exposure to the
kitchen, furniture, construction (residential and non-residential) and specialized application industries, which
represented 33%, 27%, 37% and 2%, respectively, of gross sales generated by our Engineered Wood Products
division in the year ended December 31, 2020. Growth in the resilient kitchen and furniture end-markets is
primarily driven by robust Western European demand, an increasing shift towards higher-value premium
products, as well as an increase in export of high-end kitchens produced in Germany. Growth in the welldiversified construction industry is primarily driven by robust domestic German demand as well as increased
usage of sustainable materials, including wood.

_Our primary exposure is to the renovation and replacement segment, which is more resilient to macroeconomic_
_fluctuations_

Our business further benefits from the significant exposure to the renovation and replacement segment. This
segment has historically been more resilient and less volatile than new construction activity in periods of
economic recession and reduced investments. We estimate that in 2020 the renovation and replacement segment
accounted for over 75% of gross sales from our Engineered Wood Products division compared to 70% in the
2019. We estimate that in 2020 the new construction segment accounted for approximately 22% of gross sales
from our Engineered Wood Products division, compared to approximately 30% in 2019. As a result, we have
benefitted from stable, through-the-cycle revenue generation and gross margins. We also see a secular trend of
energy saving and sustainability enhancing renovations which further drives growth in the renovation and
replacement segment.

We believe there are three structural drivers that have driven growth in our end-markets in recent years.
These are home improvement, premiumization (i.e., the integration of the kitchen into the living space) and the
trend towards more sustainable, environment friendly buildings. These trends have been visible for years and
have been further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect that once COVID-19-related restrictions
are lifted, these trends will be reinforced and continue to drive growth in our end-markets in the coming years. In
particular, we believe that employers will continue to adopt, and employees will continue to support, flexible
work models, leading to an increase in remote working. We believe premiumization to continue as a trend and
believe we are well positioned given our focus on innovative, high value added products. We expect this will
mainly benefit the kitchen and furniture end-markets.

In addition, government subsidy programs for the use of sustainable materials in buildings have increased,
and are expected to continue to increase, demand for wood and wood-based products. Steady increase of usage of
wood as environmentally friendly and renewable material accelerated by heightened focus on sustainability is a
long term trend that is here to stay. We expect this will primarily benefit the construction end-markets. This is
further reinforced by recent trends, where we estimate that the share of wooden houses out of total pre-fabricated
houses in Germany increased from approximately 13.5% in 2000 to approximately 15% in 2010 and
approximately 20% in 2020, and is expected to reach approximately 25% in 2025. Similarly, we estimate that the
share of energy efficient renovations out of total renovations in Germany increased from approximately 9% in
2015 to approximately 10% in 2020, and is expected to reach approximately 15% in 2025.

_Favorable industry dynamics in our core markets_

We estimate that in 2020 the top three and five manufacturers in the DACH region, including us, had a
combined market share of approximately 50% and 70%, respectively. We believe that the structural reduction in
engineered wood production capacity over the last ten years has contributed to a healthy and disciplined market.
In particular, we estimate that total engineered wood production capacity in Western Europe has been reduced
significantly since 2005. This was primarily due to the financial crisis in the late 2000s, which rendered some
production facilities uneconomical. Given such reduced capacity, utilization rates among engineered wood
manufacturing facilities in the DACH region have been stable since 2012 at well over 90% compared to
approximately 80% in 2009. Furthermore, market participants have increasingly focused on premium products,
which, in combination with the disciplined capacity development, have led to higher EBITDA margins among
the top tier producers in our markets.

We benefit from several industry dynamics which limit the ability of new competitors to enter our core
DACH market. Building new engineered wood manufacturing plants in Western Europe and installing
state-of-the-art equipment for value-added and highly-automated basic products requires significant initial capital
investments. For example, we estimate that the construction of a new particleboard manufacturing plant in the

115


-----

DACH region would require an investment of approximately €300 million to €500 million, given the high
minimum scale and level of automation required to compete effectively. Furthermore, high regulatory and
environmental permit costs and requirements, including lengthy lead times for certain regulatory approvals,
significantly reduce the likelihood of meaningful capacity additions in the DACH region. According to a report
prepared for us by a leading international consulting firm, capacity additions in both RCB and MFB are unlikely
to exceed projected demand growth, which suggests stable utilization rates.

Our recurring customer survey feedback has demonstrated that customers value the long-standing
relationships, reliable supply and consistent quality among products and geographies, which are difficult to
replicate for new market entrants. Our customers associate the Pfleiderer brands with high product quality,
excellent customer service and reliability. In particular, in 2020, our Engineered Wood Products division
achieved a “net promoter score” of 29% in an NPS survey prepared for us by a leading international consulting
firm, which demonstrates the strength of the Pfleiderer’s brand and customers’ satisfaction with our delivery. We
are among the few large scale suppliers capable of servicing the industry’s leading customers and pride ourselves
on being able to address their needs across leveraging our basic, value-added and high value-added products. Our
combination of scale and focus on industry-leading value-added and high-value added products provides us with
a strong relative cost position, while at the same time providing value through our strong portfolio of premium
products.

Due to the limited ability to profitably transport engineered wood products and key raw materials, such as
resins, over long distances, production facilities need to be located in close proximity to customers to compete in
a cost-effective manner. As a result, competition in our markets from lower-production cost geographies, such as
Eastern Europe, is limited. The production of engineered wood products requires market expertise and
established relationships with raw material suppliers, as the availability of raw materials, particularly wood and
high quality sawdust for thin surfaces, is limited and regionally fragmented, which increases sourcing
complexity. The ability of manufacturers to hedge raw material risk through the the mix of wood and wood
substitutes used is limited.

**_We are a leading producer of premium products with a loyal, diversified customer base_**

Through our Engineered Wood Products division, we focus on providing a broad range of value-added and
high value-added products generating high and resilient contribution margins to a large, diversified and loyal
customer base.

_Strong focus on value-added and high value-added products generating high and resilient contribution margins_

We are a leading producer of high-quality premium engineered wood-based products focused on providing
our customers with value-added and high value-added products. These premium products require increased levels
of customization compared to basic products and therefore generate higher and more resilient margins. In the
year ended December 31, 2020, our value-added and high value-added products accounted for 23% and 55%,
respectively, of our Engineered Wood Products division’s gross sales. We are currently one of only two scale
manufacturers of engineered wood products and laminates in the DACH region (Egger being the other) focused
on value-added and high-value added products instead of the volume-driven market basic products, which
companies such as Kronospan, Sonoe Arauco and Swiss Krono produce.

We typically work closely with our customers, particularly in the kitchen, furniture and construction
end-markets, to provide products that meet their requirements for specific applications, such as consistent color
and haptic qualities, durability, thickness, scratch resistance, waterproofing or fire-resistance. As a result, our
value-added products are more difficult to substitute than basic products, and price and demand for our valueadded products have historically been higher and more stable.

Furthermore, our high share of value-added and high value-added products gives us high and relatively
stable contribution margins. While we consider the average contribution margin for our basic products as very
attractive, our value-added and high-value added products have contribution margins which are on average
around five and more than ten percentage points, respectively, higher than the contribution margin of our basic
products. Our value-added and high value-added products also drive customer retention and are subject to less
pricing pressure than basic products. This is due to the limited number of value-added product manufacturers in
our markets and because customers of value-added products tend to value product customization, quality, design,
customer service levels and just-in-time delivery over price. In addition, our products generally represent a small
portion of their total costs incurred in manufacturing their finished products. According to management data and
third party reports, basic products typically make up approximately 30-40% of our individual end-customer’s
total cost base, while value-added products typically make up approximately 10-20% and high value-added
products typically make up less than 10%. To maintain our competitive position, we continuously develop new
value-added products, which we often develop in close cooperation with our customers to meet their required
specifications.

_Diversified and loyal customer base with low customer concentration and long standing relationships_

In our Engineered Wood Products division, we sell engineered wood products and laminates to a diversified
and loyal customer base comprising more than 1,500 active customers as of December 31, 2020. Our
end-markets are primarily the kitchen and furniture industries and, to a lesser degree, the construction industry.
We sell to wholesalers, retailers and other distributors, who in turn sell to smaller manufacturers and carpenters.
Our customers value us for our high quality products, consistent on-time delivery performance and wide range of
décors and textures that help differentiate their end products. For example, according to our NPS surveys, which
measures the propensity for our customers to recommend our products, our Engineered Wood Products division
achieved a “net promoter score” of 29% in 2020. This compares to an average of negative 3% for our key
competitors in the same year. We believe that our consistently high levels of customer satisfaction are driven by
our strong track record of launching new and innovative products, our ability to supply them continuously with

117


-----

matching components for repair and replacement over the useful life of their products. In addition, there is a
limited number of competitors that can offer a breadth and scope of products similar to ours.

Our business also benefits from the longevity of our customer relationships and a significant number of our
customers have purchased from us for more than thirty years. In particular, all of our top ten customers in our
Engineered Wood Products division have been our customers for ten or more years, with our relationships with
each of our top four customers spanning more than 20 years. In turn, long-standing customer relationships
improve product planning, financial forecasting and stability. We also benefit from low customer concentration.
The top ten and top 50 external customers of our Engineered Wood Products division represented 18% and 41%
of the division’s external net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. No single external
customer represented more than 5% of our Engineered Wood Products division’s external net sales in the same
period.

**_We have a long-standing and market leading focus on ESG trends with a sustainable manufacturing_**
**_approach_**

Wood, an inherently sustainable resource, has been at the core of our focus for more than 125 years. The
renewable nature of wood, our single most important raw material, has historically played a major role in shaping
our corporate culture. Over the last several decades, we have established a strong focus on ESG and sustainability
trends in our key end-markets. This is supported by our sustainable manufacturing process focused on protecting
the environment, while not compromising the high quality of our products. In 1987, we introduced to the market
our LivingBoard panels, which are made with formaldehyde-free glue and have been are certified as a “green”
building product. In addition, we started using recycled wood at our plants in 1993. In 1997, we also established
our first CHP (combined heat power plant) plant to produce electricity from carbon-neutral biomass.

We focus on the sustainable sourcing of wood and constantly endeavor to increase the share of recycled
wood used in our products. By increasing the amount of recycled wood used in our products, we are able to
decrease our use of fresh wood and lower our overall raw material costs and increase our margins. At the same
time, utilizing recycled wood in our manufacturing processes allows us to meet the increasing demand for
sustainable products in our end-markets. This is coupled with the growing willingness by our end-customers to
pay higher prices for environmentally friendly products.

We are among the first in the industry to use closed-loop recycling of wood waste and cascading utilization
of wood, which consists of the efficient utilization of wood as a resource through multiple processing stages,
from harvesting to recycling and energy recovery. We believe that the cascading utilization of wood is the only
wood utilization model that can guarantee sustainable production of high quality, innovative wood products,
while relieving the burden on forestry and reducing our overall environmental footprint. We will continue to
strengthen partnerships with external stakeholders, including innovative and certified recycling companies,
furniture manufacturers, suppliers and customers to promote the cascading utilization of wood and closed-loop
recycling to increase the supply of recycled wood in our production process.

We have made dedicated and meaningful capital investments in order to increase the share of recycled wood
used in our products. We estimate that in the year ended December 31, 2020, recycled wood represented
approximately 40% of total wood used in 2020, compared to approximately 38% in 2018. Pursuant to the
Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework that we adopted in connection with the Offering, we have
committed to increase the Percentage of Recycled Wood Used to at least 44% by the end of 2022 and 50% by the
end of 2025, in each case from our 2020 baseline. Based on management data and a report prepared for us by a
leading international consulting firm, the share of recycled wood we use in our products is significantly higher
than those of one of our key competitors, one of the few to make such information public, which was
approximately 21% in 2020. In addition, we estimate that in the year ended December 31, 2020, industrial wood,
which is used as pre-consumer recycling material, represented approximately 45% of total wood used, increasing
the share of overall recycled materials used in our products to approximately 84%.

All of the fresh wood we process at our plants is sourced from sustainably managed forests that are largely
certified by well-recognized industry organizations such as FSC[®] and PEFC, which ensure that wood is sourced
in a sustainable way and that biodiversity as well as existing fauna and flora is safeguarded. We estimate that in
the the year ended December 31, 2020, fresh, sustainably sourced wood represented approximately 14% of total
wood used. Our strong commitment to sustainability and environmental protection is also testified by the

118


-----

recognition of an increasing number of our engineered wood products as Cradle to Cradle Certified[™], a globally
accepted measure of safer, more sustainable products made for the circular economy.

In order to protect the environment, meet sustainability needs and contribute to the mitigation of the effects
of climate change, we also focus on minimizing environmental pollution and, in particular, on reducing our
Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions. We estimate that in 2020 we generated approximately 220.2 kT of
Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions compared to approximately 238.5 kT and approximately 270.6 kT in
2019 and 2018, respectively. Overall, we estimate that we reduced Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions by
approximately 26% from 2013 to 2020. Pursuant to the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework that we
adopted in connection with the Offering, we have committed to reduce our Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas
Emissions to 201.7 kT by the end of 2022 and to 173.9 kT by the end of 2025, in each case from 220.2 kT in
2020. We also estimate that approximately 95% of the electricity we used in 2020 came from carbon-neutral
biomass produced at our CHP plants.

In addition to benefitting the environment, our meaningful investment in our recycled wood capacity also
meaningfully enhances our relative cost position as recycled wood is cheaper to source than fresh wood.
Furthermore, our commitment to reducing our Scope 1 & Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions, which we have
focused on since the introduction of our emission-free LivingBoard in 1987, meaningfully enhances the
attractiveness of our products to our sustainability-conscious end customers.

**_We have a solid and resilient financial profile supported by high Adjusted EBITDA margins and strong free_**
**_cash flow generation_**

_Resilient, through-the-cycle financial performance_

During the past ten years, we have transformed our company into a stable and resilient business with a
strong focus on premium products and a highly variable cost base. As a result, our Adjusted EBITDA grew at a
CAGR of 9.8% between 2012 and 2020 and our Adjusted EBITDA margins increased from 10.1% in 2012 to
16.9% in 2020, and in the year ended December 31, 2020, our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.3%.
Adjusted EBITDA has grown every year since 2012 in spite of varied macroeconomic environments, including
but not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In addition, the order book in our Engineered Wood
Products division increased from a monthly average of approximately €69 million in the the year ended
December 31, 2020 to approximately €120 million in January 2021, approximately €131 million in February
2021 and approximately €137 million in March 2021, which we believe provides us with good visibility on our
sales performance in the second quarter of 2021. The following graph provides an overview of the development
of our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin from 2012 to 2020:

(1) Adjusted EBITDA gives effect to IFRS 16 from January 1, 2018, which was the date of the Issuer’s transition to IFRS. Adjusted
EBITDA for the periods from 2018 to 2020 is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 is a pro
forma amount, which includes an estimated adjustment to give effect to the impact of IFRS 16 had we adopted it during this period,
based on the impact of IFRS 16 on our Adjusted EBITDA for 2018. Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 has been derived from the combined
financial statements for the Issuer and may not be presented on the same basis as Adjusted EBITDA for the periods after December 31,
2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the periods from 2012 to 2016 is based on the business unit reporting in our unaudited management
accounts, which do not give effect to the optimization of our corporate structure in 2020 and are not directly comparable to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2) Refers to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA with Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures
based on Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma adjusted net sales, which includes an estimated net sales contribution of
€11.6 million from our pricing initiatives.

(3) Based on Adjusted EBITDA of approximately €76 million generated in the second half of 2020.

We believe that the pricing of premium products has historically been less impacted by the underlying raw
materials price developments as compared to basic products and we have been able to maintain high price levels
even when raw material prices decreased. In addition, our focus on value-added and high value-added products
has historically allowed us to actively pass through raw material price increases to our customers due to
relatively stable customer demand for these products and low price elasticity. In the year ended December 31,
2020, we achieved a net pass-through of approximately €13.4 million. At the same time, we were able to increase
the contribution margin of our high value-added products by approximately four percentage points from 2018 to
2020.

Over the past ten years, we have also implemented a number of initiatives to make our operations more
stable and resilient and increase the share of variable costs in our cost structure. Between 2017 and 2020, we
have made significant capital expenditures to modernize our facilities and increase automation, digitalization and
efficiency. We have also rationalized our fixed cost structure by reducing our full-time employees from 2,338 as
of December 31, 2016 to 2,227 as of December 31, 2020. Starting in the year ended December 31, 2019, we
implemented a number of cost saving and efficiency initiatives aimed at streamlining our cost base by optimizing
our headcount, obtain logistics, administrative and indirect procurement cost savings, and achieve raw material
efficiencies. These cost initiatives resulted in savings of €20.5 million reflected in our results for the year ended
December 31, 2020. In addition to our cost saving initiatives, in 2020 we began implementing certain price
improvement initiatives aimed at further improving our product margins. As a result of our cost saving
initiatives, we decreased our fixed costs to 13% of our total cost base in the year ended December 31, 2020.

We believe that our focus on making our business more resilient and sustainable has allowed us to soften the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is reflected in our performance in 2020. This has also allowed us to
benefit from the strong economic recovery starting in the third quarter of 2020. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA of
our Engineered Wood Products division increased by 3% and 26%, respectively, in the third and fourth quarters
of 2020 compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2019. This performance highlighted the success of our
strategy of focusing on the value-added segment in the resilient kitchen and furniture end markets. Overall, in the
year ended December 2020, our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by over 7% and 2%,
respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Industry-leading Adjusted EBITDA margins and strong Adjusted Free Cash Flow generation_

We benefit from industry-leading Adjusted EBITDA margins and strong cash flow generation relative to
our peers. We achieve this through our higher margin products in our product portfolio, our strong relative cost
position which is the result of our scale and high levels of automation, our strong pricing discipline, supported by
efficient raw material sourcing (including the use of recycled wood) and active management of raw material cost
pass-through. We have also successfully implemented several structural cost saving initiatives during both years
ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 (described elsewhere in this offering memorandum).

Between 2018 and 2020, our Adjusted Free Cash Flow increased from €18.6 in the year ended
December 31, 2018 to €71.0 in the year ended December 31, 2020. In the same year, our Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure margin was 80%. In 2020, based on public-available information,
we have among the highest Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures
margins within the industry, including among our direct competitors and a broader selection of listed building
materials peers. The following graphic provides an overview of our and our direct competitors’ and a broader
selection of listed building materials peers’ Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EBITDA less capital
expenditure margin in 2020.

**_Highly experienced management team with a strong track record_**

Our business benefits from the industry expertise and know-how of our experienced senior management
team, which has long-standing experience in building materials manufacturing and distribution, and a strong
track record of financial and operational success in both favorable and challenging market conditions. Our senior
management includes Miguel Kohlmann, who is the Chairperson of the Parent’s Advisory board since September
2020, having previously served as an advisor to the board since May 2018, and has more than 30 years of
experience in management positions; Dr. Frank Herrmann, who has been our Chief Operating Officer since May
2019 and has more than ten years of experience in operational management roles; and Stefan Zinn, who has been
our Chief Commercial Officer since January 2019 and has more than 25 years of experience in sales positions. In
addition, in connection with the completion of the Restructuring and in preparation for a renewed phase of
growth, in January 2021, we welcomed our new Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Mani Herold, who has over 20 years
of experience in finance positions at global companies, including more than nine years as CFO, and in February
2021, we welcomed our new Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson in respect of our Engineered Wood
Products division, Dr. Boris Gorella, who has over 30 years of experience in leadership positions, including more
than ten years as CEO, with industrial coatings, chemical and consulting companies. Since February 2021, our
former CEO, Zbigniew Prokopowicz, is a member of the Advisory board of the Parent and is responsible for the
Silekol division and Panel East, providing us with continued expertise, particularly from the leadership roles he
has held in our business since 2016.

**Our Strategies**

**_Continue to focus on value-added and high value-added premium products_**

We will continue to focus on product innovation and research and development to increase the share of our
value-added and high-value add engineered wood products in our portfolio. We will focus on expanding the
characteristics of the finishes of our HPL products, such as HPL products with special coating for outdoor use.
We believe such products are less price elastic and will further help us penetrate the outdoor furniture market.

121


-----

We plan to increase our output of value-added and high-value added products by selectively reducing our
end-market sale of of basic raw particleboards, and plan to use this particleboard capacity to produce higher
value laminated and coated products (such as MFB and coated HPL).

We sell our products to a variety of niche markets, such as hospitals, hotels, elevator interiors, playground,
garden furniture and caravan and mobile home interiors. We will continue to focus on identifying additional
attractive niche markets for value-added and high-value add products in order to increase customer
diversification. As transportation cost is less relevant for high-value add products, we also plan to expand our
exporting activities of such products to other regions, including China and Taiwan.

Lastly, we will continue to actively manage the pricing of our premium products by analyzing our markets,
enhancing the distinguishing features of our products, achieving greater pass-through of raw material costs to our
customers. We will also continue to actively monitor our portfolio of basic products with a view to shifting into
HPL products. We believe this strategy will result in a continued augmentation in the average price and
contribution margin of our product portfolio.

**_Continue to increase our focus on ESG trends and sustainable manufacturing_**

We will continue to focus on the sustainable sourcing of wood and on making our manufacturing processes
and product portfolio more sustainable. This is part of our ongoing environmental and sustainability strategy and
supports key trends in the kitchen, furniture and construction industries. We believe we can establish a leading
market position in products that have been certified as sustainable, such as “Blue Angel” certified products,
which have been certified by the German government as environmentally friendly. For example, in 1987, we
were among the first wood panel manufacturers to introduce engineered wood panels made with formaldehydefree glue, our LivingBoard panels, which obtained the prestigious “Blue Angel” certification. We are also the
first panel manufacturer that has obtained the renowned “Cradle to Cradle” certification on several products. In
the construction markets, there is a growing demand for environmentally sustainable products, such as woodbased products for pre-fabricated houses. We believe we will be able to meet this demand through our
specialized product lines.

Pursuant to the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework that we adopted in connection with the
Offering, we have committed to increase the share of the recycled wood used in our products from 40% in the
year ended December 31, 2020, to at least 44% by the end of 2022 and at least 50% by the end of 2025. In order
to do this, we will continue focus on closed-loop recycling of wood waste and cascading utilization of wood. In
addition, starting from 2021 we plan to invest further in debottlenecking actions to unlock our capacity to
produce higher quantities of recycled wood at our Neumarkt and Leutkirch facilities. We believe that the use of
recycled wood not only drives sustainability, but also reduces our costs. These materials tend to be cheaper and
have lower energy costs than non-sustainable products since they use a lower amount of water, requiring less
drying.

Additionally, we are aiming to increase the number of environmentally-friendly adhesives in our productportfolio. We currently offer certified particleboards with formaldehyde-reduced glues for construction
applications, which have lower emission applications. We will also support sustainability in our processes by
continuing to generate green electricity with our own power plants and heat from wood that can no longer be
used as a material for our products, making us climate-neutral, and by feeding surplus electricity into the public
power network.

Finally, we will continue to focus on avoiding any form of environmental pollution and, pursuant to the
Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework that we adopted in connection with the Offering, we have
committed to reduce our Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions to 201.7 kT by the end of 2022 and to 173.9 kT
by the end of 2025, in each case from our baseline of 220.2 kT in 2020.

We believe that these investments and activities are not only good for the environment, but also positively
impact our Adjusted EBITDA growth due to the associated reduction in input costs per unit, and they increase
the perceived value of our products, enabling us to meet the increasing demand for sustainable products in our
end-markets.

**_Maintaining a focus on cost reduction and efficiency and pricing improvements to further increase our_**
**_margins_**

We intend to continue to focus on operational efficiencies, which we believe result in cost reductions,
ultimately allowing us to further improve margins and cash flow generation and contributing to the overall
resilience of our business. In line with these objectives, we are aiming to complete the implementation of the cost
saving initiatives that our management team actioned in 2019 and 2020. Going forward, we also plan to increase
our focus on improving raw material mix and consumption, further optimizing our headcount, decreasing indirect
costs and logistics costs, and implementing a new procurement program. Overall, we are targeting to realize
more than €25 million of cost savings through these initiatives over the next three years.

Our raw material mix and consumption improvements focus primarily on improving wood consumption,
particularly by increasing the share of recycled wood and chemicals within our total raw materials consumption,
further reducing our SKUs and increasingly adopting data-driven processes to improve raw materials yield.

We also intend to continue taking advantage of opportunities to reduce our headcount at our production
facilities and administrative functions, through a combination of redundancies, early retirement arrangements and
other FTE rationalization measures. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have negotiated the
necessary framework agreements with the worker’s council, which provide us with the necessary flexibility to
implement these plans quickly. We believe these measures, coupled with the implementation of process
optimization and further technology investments, will drive significant headcount savings. We aim at further
optimizing indirect costs that are non-labor related, such as those relating to repair, maintenance and waste
disposal services. We intend to do so by continuing to consolidate our supplier base through our re-tendering
process and focusing on tighter procurement controls. In addition, we intend to continue focusing on further
reducing our logistics costs by utilizing a centralized IT platform for logistics tenders in order to take advantage
of spot pricing conditions as opposed to contracted rates.

We expect to further benefit from the strategic price improvement measures that we initiated in 2020 and
which we intend to expand upon going forward. In particular, we will complete the strategic review of our
product pricing across our product portfolio and across all sales channels and sales regions. We also intend to
apply various price quality management actions, including price differentiation on product value, clear pricing
escalation procedures, price quality reporting and upgraded information technology systems.

**_Continuing to implement our strategic pricing initiatives_**

We continuously strive to optimize the prices for our products. In the second quarter of 2020, we engaged a
leading global consultancy firm to conduct a strategic review of pricing across our product portfolio aimed at
fixing certain structural gaps and systems and implementing new pricing rules into our ERP systems to improve
pricing discipline and invoicing. Following this strategic pricing review, we implemented a number of structural
pricing initiatives to improve pricing accuracy across all our products and customers as well as our invoicing
process. These structural pricing initiatives included (i) the automatic application of contractually agreed
surcharges to low volume orders, (ii) list price optimizations, (iii) the reduction of the number of small,
unprofitable orders and (iv) the implementation of certain other price quality management actions, including
price differentiation on product value, clear pricing escalation procedures, price quality reporting and upgraded
information technology systems. We estimate that these initiatives will have a total impact on our Adjusted
EBITDA of approximately €5.3 million by the end of 2021, of which we have included €3.0 million in our Pro
_Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020, and of approximately €15 million by the end of_
2023.

In connection with the launch of our new 2021-2024 product collection in 2021, we increased the price of
certain value-added and high value-added products of our Engineered Wood Products division. Our new
four-year year collection of value-added and high value-added products replaced our existing collection on
January 1, 2021. We estimate that these price increases will contribute €8.6 million to our Adjusted EBITDA for
the year ending December 31, 2021, which is less than 40% of agreed price increases with certain customers as
of December 31, 2020.

**_Prudent management of capital expenditure to deliver growth and maintain strong free cash flow conversion_**

Commencing in 2019, we conducted a review of our resource allocation and capital expenditure
management. Historically, our capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales has been more than 7%, primarily

123


-----

due to our significant investments into new production lines, additional capacity and debottlenecking projects.
Examples of recent investments include the installation of a lacquering line in our Leutkirch facility, the
expansion of drying capacity at our Leutkirch facility and capacity for phenolic resins, formaldehyde and
melamine in our Silekol division, and the installation of sanding lines at our Neumarkt and Baruth plants.

In addition, our high level of capital expenditure in recent years has been due to required investments into
environmental and occupational health initiatives and certain inefficient repair and maintenance investments.
These investments were essential for us to operate a stable and environmentally friendly production base. We
review investment projects both during and after implementation to check success and learn in case of deviation
from our targets, and have new procedures in place that entail reviewing capital expenditures monthly in order to
avoid budget overruns and ensure timing compliance. As a result, our capital expenditures to net sales ratio
decreased to 5.5% in 2020. We are targeting to further decrease our capital expenditures to net sales ratio to 4.5%
in the medium term. We currently have no plans to invest in new production lines and all necessary investments
required to comply with current environmental, health and safety regulations have been implemented.

We have revised our repair and maintenance approach towards condition based maintenance, which allows
for better planning and ultimately lower capital expenditures. Our maintenance capital expenditure requirements
are now relatively limited and include expenditures related to periodic plants shutdowns, replacement of
equipment, maintenance of our information technology systems and regulatory-driven expenditures. Between
2018 and 2020, maintenance capital expenditures represented approximately 3.5% of our net sales. In addition,
we plan to focus our capital expenditures into targeted projects that we believe will help us achieve our return on
investment requirements, which we have set at two years, except for a small number of strategic investments. For
example, we are currently implementing a pilot project for the installation of a scanner solution in two lines at
our Gütersloh plant which we expect to be completed at the end of 2020 and will then be rolled out to our other
plants. We expect it will take over three years to achieve returns for this project. In addition, we intend to
continue investing in debottlenecking actions in our Engineered Wood Products divisions. These actions include
the expansion of silo capacity for wood at our plant in Neumarkt and the installation of short-cycle presses at our
plant in Leutkirch, which we expect will result in additional recycling capacity during 2021. We also intend to
expand storage capacities in our Silekol division. We will continue to make selected strategic investments in
efficiency-driven projects to achieve further cost savings and increase the share of recycled wood used in our
products.

In the second half of 2019, we launched a centralized project aiming at organizing the management of our
working capital, pursuant to which we monitor all functions, such as supply chain management, procurement,
sales, controlling, treasury and accounting, in order to improve key performance indicators. We have identified
the main drivers that will help us optimize our working capital, including inventories and semi-finished and
finished-goods, in particular the composition of trade payables and trade receivables. We have also established a
new reporting standard for working capital in order to monitor working capital and target achievements. For
example, we have set clear reporting dates for balance sheet items or ratios targets, such as days payable
outstanding and days sales outstanding. We have also agreed and executed measures to adjust stocks and
decrease working capital in a sustainable manner. As a result, our net cash position has improved significantly.
Going forward, we will continue to focus on tight trade working capital management to further improve our cash
flow generation.

**History**

Our business was founded in 1894, initially as a timber trading operation, before transforming into a
producer of processed wood products. We acquired our first sawmills in Heilbronn and Wernberg, Germany in
1916 and constructed an impregnating plant with a sawmill in Neumarkt, Germany in 1919. We continued to
grow as a family-owned business until the initial public offering of the Issuer (then known as Pfleiderer AG) on
the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 1997. As a public company, we engaged in a period of rapid expansion through
strategic acquisitions, leading to a broader product portfolio and a significant geographic presence across Europe
(including Germany, Poland, Russia and Sweden) and North America (including the United States and Canada)
by 2008. As part of this expansion, we also listed our Polish subsidiary, Pfleiderer Grajewo S.A., on the Warsaw
Stock Exchange in 1997.

As a consequence of a significantly over-levered balance sheet due to an excessive expansion strategy
coupled with the global financial crisis in 2009, the effects of which were further exacerbated by the housing

124


-----

crisis in the United States, trading of our shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange ceased in November 2012 and
certain of our creditors took control of our business. To improve profitability and our resilience during market
cycles, we initiated strategic facility closures, divestments and functional optimization programs focused on cost
reductions and improved efficiency. We also invested in our core products and key markets. In doing so, we
divested our operations in Russia, the United States and Canada and redefined our business as two independent
divisions, “Core West” and “Core East,” operating out of Germany and Poland, respectively.

In 2016, we undertook a restructuring, pursuant to which the Issuer was acquired by Pfleiderer Grajewo
S.A., its listed Polish subsidiary in a reverse merger. In connection with the restructuring, Pfleiderer Grajewo
S.A. changed its name to Pfleiderer Group S.A. and re-listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. In August 2019,
the European Commission approved the public tender offer by Volantis Bidco B.V., an indirect subsidiary of
SVPGlobal, ultimately resulting in SVPGlobal holding all of the outstanding share capital of the Parent.

Historically, our Parent operated our business through three divisions: Engineered Wood Products, Silekol
and Panel East. Following the take private of our Parent in September 2019, our Sponsor separated our
Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions from Panel East. As a result of the optimization of our
corporate structure, we believe we benefit from a strongly enhanced credit profile due to (i) an improved business
mix with strong market position in the more stable and attractive Western European market, (ii) greater focus on
value-add products with a loyal and more diversified customer base and (iii) higher and more resilient margin
and cash flow profiles. To separate the Silekol division from the operations of the Panel East division and
combine the Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions, we completed the Silekol Transfer on March 6,
2020. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2020, we changed the Parent’s jurisdiction of incorporation
from Poland to Germany and converted the Parent from a Polish public company (spółka akcyjna) into a besloten
_vennootschap & limited partner (besloten vennootschap & Compagnie Kommanditgesellschaft). For more_
information on the optimization of our corporate structure, please see “Summary—The Optimization of Our
_Corporate Structure” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations—The Optimization of Our Corporate Structure.”_

We now operate our Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions together through the Issuer, while
Panel East operates independently and on an arm’s-length basis, and will be outside the Restricted Group. Our
Engineered Wood Products primarily produces engineered wood products and laminates in Germany and sells its
products to customers, who are primarily located in the DACH region and across Western Europe. Our Silekol
division produces resins and other chemicals in Poland and sells its products to customers in Central and Eastern
Europe as well as to the Engineered Wood Products division and Panel East.

**Engineered Wood Products**

**_Our Products_**

Through our Engineered Wood Products division, we produce and distribute a comprehensive range of
wood products, laminates and decorative design products. We categorize our products as basic products, valueadded products or high value-added products, depending on the applied degree of surface treatments,
functionality and decorative features. Our products have diverse applications, including in kitchen construction
or remodeling, furniture and construction industries, as well as for niche end-markets such as shop fittings and
outdoor façades.

Overall, we offer 14 wood panel and laminate product groups, with different degree of value addition, which
can be clustered in five product segments. The following table sets forth an overview of our five product
segments in our Engineered Wood Products division, their percentage of gross sales generated in our Engineered
Wood Products division from sales of products to external customers for the year ended December 31, 2020.

125


-----

_High Value-Added Products_

Our high value-added products include strongly enhanced boards, such as melamine-faced board (“MFB”),
high pressure laminate (“HPL”) and lacquered MFB and HPL, which have been given advanced surface
treatment (including, for example, lacquered or colored melamine surface treatment), significant functionality
(including, for example, anti-fingerprint, impact resistance and ease of care) and a wide variety of decorative
features for designs and finishes. Our high value-added products, particularly for the kitchen, furniture and
construction end-markets, are frequently “made to order” to meet customer requirements for specific applications
that not only demand consistent color and haptic qualities but also call for other properties such as durability, a
specific thickness, scratch resistance or fire-resistance.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, our high value-added products accounted for 55% of our Engineered
Wood Products division’s gross sales, and generated contribution margins which were on average more than ten
percentage points higher than the average contribution margins generated on our basic products in the same year.
In the kitchen, furniture and construction markets, we continue to focus on high value-added products due to the
“made-to-order” nature of these products, which promotes demand stability, price stability and visibility of future
net sales. The “made-to-order” nature of our high-value added products also tends to limit customer defections,
as our competitors may not be able to provide the same products and, to the extent our competitors can offer
alternative products, a customer’s transition to a different supplier would trigger significant lead times to source
replacement products and high switching costs due to the need for consistency in décor and finish. Furthermore,
customers of high value-added products have historically shown lower sensitivity to price increases since the cost
of such products represents a smaller percentage of their total finished products budget, as compared to
customers of basic products. As a result, our customers have generally accepted premium prices, price increases
and pass-through of increased raw material costs in the past, allowing us to maintain high margins on our high
value-added products. Our high value-added products also give us the opportunity to enter into new niche
end-markets because of the breadth of customizable features they offer existing and potential customers. Our
high value-added products are primarily produced and sold in low to medium volumes.

Set forth below are brief descriptions of our key high value-added products.

   - _Melamine-faced board (MFB): Our high value-added MFB is available in a wide range of different_
core materials, such as standard chipboards (in “P2-P3” grade), specialty chipboards (such as low
emission boards, fire resistant boards, and electrostatically dissipative boards) and fiber boards. MFB is
directly laminated on both sides with a decorative melamine resin in a variety of color and surface
finishes. The lamination is also available in multi-layer construction, creating different textures and
designs. Sold through our DecoBoard range, our MFB boards are available in formaldehyde-reduced,
hygienic, low-emission, flame retardant, low-maintenance and moisture-resistant formats, making them
suitable for a wide range of uses in kitchen and furniture making and interior fixtures and finishes. Our
low-emission and formaldehyde-reduced MFB is typically used for interior design and furniture in both
private and public premises, such as hotels, schools, offices and administrative buildings. Additionally,
our moisture-resistant MFB is typically used in the construction of bathroom furniture.

   - _High pressure laminate (HPL): HPL is a durable laminate or compact, which is produced by first_
saturating multiple layers of craft paper with phenolic resin, then coating one or both sides with
melamine resin-coated décor paper, metallic decorative coating or magnetic decorative coating and
finally fusing the materials together under heat and pressure. HPL may have a brown core, black core
or white core or it may be pigmented through to the core to avoid visible edges and joints. HPL may be
used as a surface material that is combined with a core material such as chipboard or on a stand-alone

126


-----

basis. The typical thickness of HPL ranges from 0.5 mm to 15 mm, with thin HPL typically being used
as a surface for doors and interior fittings and thick HPL (over 2 mm) being used as a stand-alone
product, typically for bathroom fittings, tabletops and exterior applications like outdoor furniture and
façades.

   - _Lacquered MFB and HPL: Our lacquering line at our Leutkirch production facility in Germany was_
created to adapt our production capacity to the needs of our customers by expanding our product
portfolio with more decorative patterns and surfaces. The installation of our lacquering line has
allowed us to create new high-value added products, such as lacquered front doors for furniture and
kitchen applications as well as for outdoor applications, such as compact boards for outdoor furniture
and façade, thus allowing us to access new end-markets. The integration of our lacquering line within
our color match system ensures long-lasting color stability. Our lacquering line technology also creates
mirror effects for our products in a premium high gloss surface finish. The lacquering line, at 165
meters long, is the biggest lacquering line using the HotCoating system in the world.

_Value-Added Products_

Our value-added products include enhanced boards, such as chipboard, melamine-faced chipboard and
lacquered high-density fiberboard, which have been given basic surface treatment (including, for example, a
white melamine surface), moderate functionality (including, for example, stress and moisture resistance, bending
strength or fire protection) and decorative features.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, our value-added products accounted for 23% of our Engineered
Wood Products division’s gross sales and generated contribution margins which were on average five percentage
points higher than the average contribution margins of our basic products in the same year. Like our high valueadded products, our value-added products are frequently “made to order” to meet customer requirements for
specific applications. As a result, they are more difficult to substitute than basic products and exhibit a more
stable price and demand pattern. The “made-to-order” nature of these products also promotes customer loyalty,
high margins and visibility of future net sales. Our value-added products are primarily produced and sold in
medium to large volumes.

Set forth below are brief descriptions of our key value-added products.

   - _Chipboard: Chipboard is a wood panel manufactured by compressing wood chips, sawmill shavings,_
sawdust, recycled wood or biomass from other plants and a synthetic resin adhesive (urea or melamine
resin or formaldehyde-free PMDI (polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate) resin) under the
application of heat. The typical density of our chipboards ranges from 600 kg/m[3] to 750 kg/m[3] and the
typical thickness ranges from 8 mm to 64 mm.

      - _Multi-function panels: Our multi-function chipboard is characterized by high bending abilities,_
loading resistance in longitudinal and transverse directions and high moisture resistance. Our
multi-function chipboard is engineered with randomly distributed wood chips and melaminereinforced urea resins. It is typically used in a range of construction applications, the production of
sturdy packaging and as structural material for exhibition stands and for interior design. For
example, our LivingBoard panels, which were introduced to the market almost four decades ago,
are certified as a “green” building product. With an unsanded contiprotect surface, it offers
moisture resistance and low swelling and is particularly ecological. Made with formaldehyde-free
glue and having been given the “Blue Angel” certification, our LivingBoard panels satisfy the
special demands for interior and exterior walls mainly used in the prefabricated housing market.

      - _Pyroex boards: Our Pyroex boards have the same advantages as standard chipboard and can be_
used for decorative purposes, but are also designed to provide protection from fires. They are
available in different materials ranging from flame resistant to non-flammable and are typically
used in facilities that have a higher demand for fire protection, such as laboratories, railway
stations, airports, hotels, exhibitions, places of public assembly, care facilities and hospitals.

   - _MFB: Our value-added MFB is the same as our high value-added MFB, discussed above, except that_
we offer the decorative melamine resin lamination in only a white decorative range.

   - _Lacquered HDF: Our lacquering line at our Leutkirch production facility produces value-added_
products, such as PrimeBoard. PrimeBoard, offered in PrimeBoard XTreme Matt or PrimeBoard
XTreme High Gloss, incorporates innovative multi-coating technology from our HotCoating system

127


-----

and acrylic lacquers, making it particularly easy to clean and resistant to scratches and high stress.
PrimeBoard is typically used for interior solutions, such as kitchen worktops.

_Basic products_

Our basic products include wood boards, such as raw chipboard and raw medium- and high-density
fiberboard (“MDF/HDF”), which come in a variety of standardized formats and thicknesses. Our basic products
are not produced with decorative features, but we believe they are a competitive advantage as they form the
foundation of our value-added and high value-added products and allow us to more fully utilize our production
facilities throughout the economic cycle.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, our basic products accounted for 21% of our Engineered Wood
Products division’s gross sales and generated very attractive contribution margins. Our basic products have
historically generated lower margins than our value-added products, primarily because customers have more
options to purchase these types of products from our competitors due to their greater standardization and lower
distinguishing qualities, as compared to the “made-to-order” nature of our value-added and high value-added
products. Therefore, competition for these products is primarily based on price and this has historically limited
our ability to increase their prices to pass increased raw material costs to our customers, particularly when supply
levels are higher than demand levels. However, while there is an extensive network of competing production
facilities that produce such basic products across Europe, there is limited competition from imported basic
products because of the high transportation costs incurred as a result of the weight and bulkiness of the products,
particularly combined with the smaller margins on basic products. As a result, we strategically built our
production facilities for our basic products close to key customers to, among other things, reduce transportation
costs. Our basic products are primarily produced and sold in large volumes.

Set forth below are brief descriptions of our key basic products.

   - _Raw chipboard: Our raw chipboard is produced from renewable raw materials and is easy to process. It_
is often used as a core or construction material, can be load-bearing or non-load-bearing and can be
produced in a variety of formats and thicknesses, with or without additional features such as moisture
resistance. In addition to our ClassicBoard and PremiumBoard lines, which are composed of wood
chips, sawmill shavings, sawdust or recycled wood and a synthetic resin adhesive. Raw chipboard is
typically used as a core material in furniture production, including for flooring, and underneath
construction materials.

   - _Raw medium-density and high-density fiberboards (“MDF/HDF”): Raw MDF and HDF are engineered_
wood products made by breaking down hardwood or softwood residuals into wood fibers, combining
those wood fibers with wax and resin and forming panels by applying high temperature and pressure.
The main difference between raw MDF and HDF is the amount of pressure applied.

      - _Raw MDF: Raw MDF boards are stronger and significantly denser than chipboard and have_
smooth surfaces suitable for a variety of applications. Raw MDF is typically used for lacquer or
lamination and can be easily shaped and finished for furniture fronts, tabletops and shop fittings.
The typical density of our raw MDF boards ranges from 650 kg/m[3] to 850 kg/m[3] and the typical
thickness ranges from 8 mm to 38 mm.

      - _Raw HDF: Raw HDF is thinner, denser, stronger and harder than raw MDF because it is_
engineered with higher pressure. Raw HDF is typically adapted for use in the furniture industry,
primarily for rear furniture walls and drawer bottoms and as carriers for laminating floors. The
typical density of our raw HDF boards ranges from 900 kg/m[3] to 950 kg/m[3] and the typical
thickness ranges from 5 mm to 9 mm. Raw thin HDF is a type of raw HDF board that is even
denser and more highly compressed than raw HDF. The typical density of our raw thin HDF
boards ranges from 800 kg/m[3] to 1,050 kg/m[3] and the typical thickness ranges from 1 mm to 5
mm. Raw thin HDF is typically adapted for use in advertising panels, packaging, furniture rear
panels or as decks for doors or lightweight construction panels.

**_Our Customers and End-Markets_**

We primarily sell our products into the DACH region, which is our core market and accounted for 61% of
our Engineered Wood Products division’s gross sales in the year ended December 31, 2020. With a market share
of 14% by net sales in 2020, our Engineered Wood Products division is the second largest manufacturer of
premium engineered wood products and laminates in the DACH region. Our other primary markets are

128


-----

neighboring regions and countries in Western Europe, such the United Kingdom, Netherlands, France and Italy.
We sell our products across a diversified range of end-markets, which increases our exposure to the renovation
and replacement segment. Our largest end-markets are the kitchen and furniture industries, and kitchen and
furniture producers accounted for 33% and 27%, respectively, of our Engineered Wood Products division’s gross
sales in the year ended December 31, 2020. Our other customers are in the furniture, construction and niche
end-markets, such as shop fittings and outdoor facades. Our customers in the kitchen and furniture industries are
primarily large producers, such as Nobilia, Schüller, Häcker, Nolte, Schmidt, Fournier, Nobia Group, Vivonio
Group and Mäusbacher. Our key customers in the construction and wholesale industries include Enno
Roggemann, Heckewerth, ZEG, Holztec, doka, CarlGötz and Kesseböhmer.

The following graphs illustrate the breakdown of our Engineered Wood Products division’s gross sales by

Denmark and Belgium.

(3) Central and Eastern Europe comprises Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.

(4) Rest of World (“RoW”) comprises the remaining jurisdictions in which our customers are located.

(5) Based on management estimates derived from the analysis of the segment exposure as prepared by a leading consulting firm for the gross
sales (excluding the impact of sales reductions, such as bonuses for customers, cash discounts and refunds) generated in the DACH
region by our Engineered Wood Products division from the sale of products to external customers excluding (i) inter-division sales from
our Engineered Wood Products division to our Silekol division and (ii) sales to Panel East.

As of December 31, 2020, our Engineered Wood Products division had a large and fragmented customer
base comprising over 1,500 active customers. We generally have low customer concentration, with the division’s
top ten external customers representing 18% of external net sales generated by our Engineered Wood Products
division in the year ended December 31, 2020. No single external customer exceeded a share of 5% of our
Engineered Wood Products division’s external net sales during the period. We also have a loyal and stable
customer base and constantly receive positive customer feedback. The majority of our customers, including our
top ten customers, have been our customers for more than ten years.

_Kitchen Industry_

Customers in the kitchen industry use our products to create kitchen cabinets and fronts, countertops and
worktops in a variety of materials and finishes. The degree of customization desired by our customers determine
which products they wish to purchase, but typically customers in the kitchen industry will require moderate to
advanced surface treatment (including, for example, with our décor paper and various surface treatments) and
functionality (including, for example, ease of care and moisture resistance) which can only be found in our valueadded and high value-added products. As a result, we typically generate high margins from customers in the
kitchen industry due to our large variety of products, new designs and excellent service levels. We believe we are
the number one supplier to two of the four largest kitchen manufacturers in the DACH region, and the second or
third largest supplier to the remaining two manufacturers.

_Furniture Industry_

Customers in the furniture industry use our products to create cabinet fronts, shelves, rear walls and drawers
in a variety of materials and finishes. The degree of customization desired by our customers determine which
products they wish to purchase. For decorative furniture and furniture for specific purposes, such as bathrooms or
office furniture, customers will typically require moderate to advanced surface treatment and functionality
(including, for example, low-emission, impact resistance, ease of care and moisture resistance), which we only
provide through our value-added and high value-added product offering. We typically generate mixed margins
from customers in the furniture industry, with higher margins from customers in the office furniture industry. We
create ongoing relationships with customers of basic products where we offer competitive pricing and customer
service as well as customers of value-added and high value-added products, allowing them to continue accessing
the furniture collection they have created with or otherwise purchased from us.

_Construction Industry_

Customers in the construction industry typically purchase our products for new build activities and use our
products to create pre-fabricated houses, built roofs, walls, concrete formworks and flooring (for example, in
storage centers with anti-slippery surfaces and office buildings). Customers in the segments of the construction
industry we serve mainly require value-added products, such as multi-function panels characterized by high
bending abilities, loading resistance in longitudinal and transverse directions and high moisture resistance. As a
result, we typically generate high to very high margins from customers in the construction industry.

_Niche Markets_

We sell our products to customers in niche markets, such as shop fittings, hospitals and other public
buildings and hotel interiors. The degree of customization desired by our customers determine which products
they wish to purchase, but typically customers in attractive niche markets will require moderate to advanced
surface treatment (including, for example, lacquered or colored finishes) and functionality (including, for
example, anti-fingerprint, impact resistance, moisture resistance and fire protection) which we only provide
through our value-added and high value-added product offering. As a result, we typically generate high margins
from customers in niche markets and create ongoing customer relationships because of the breadth of
customizable features our high value-added products offer to meet niche needs.

**_Our Production Facilities_**

We currently operate five highly automated manufacturing plants, which are strategically located across
Germany (Arnsberg, Baruth, Gütersloh, Leutkirch and Neumarkt) in close proximity to our customers in our key
market, the DACH region. This allows us to benefit from lower costs of deliveries and provide better customer
service through shorter delivery times and provides us with an important competitive advantage due to the
limited ability to profitably transport engineered wood products over long distances.

While our production facilities are operated locally to enable quick decisions and flexible reactions to
market changes, a number of functions are run centrally, which allows us to identify regional weaknesses in
quality assurance and to leverage synergies, including through the swift transfer of certain products to more costeffective production facilities.

The production process at our production facilities comprises five key steps. The first step requires the
necessary input factors, comprising resin production, energy generation in our CHP plants and inbound logistics
for our other raw materials. The second step comprises the manufacturing of panels and laminates, such as RCB,
MDF, HDF and HPL. The third step comprises the application of the finishing surface, including impregnation,
lamination, edge banding, painting and lacquering. The fourth step comprises the manufacturing of furniture
elements or interior fittings, including kitchen worktops. The fifth and final step involves outbound logistics to
ensure flexible and reliable deliveries to our customers.

(1) Our Gütersloh facility consists of one facility divided into two plants, Gütersloh I (Werk II) and Gütersloh II (Werk III).

(2) As of December 31, 2020.

Each of our five German production facilities focuses on specific customers and product groups, with
limited overlap. Our production facility in Gütersloh is located in a region where major German kitchen and
furniture producers are based and thus manufactures MFB products targeted at customers in the kitchen and
furniture industry. Our production facility in Neumarkt produces standard MFB and raw chipboards and is the
largest chipboard production facility in Western Europe and the second largest in Europe overall with a capacity
of 900,000 m[3] per annum. Our production facility in Leutkirch produces MFB products in the retail format of
2800 mm x 2100 mm and HPL products in the 2070 mm width. Our production facility in Arnsberg is a fully
integrated production facility covering the entire value chain (resin production, impregnation and HPL
production) for the production of HPL and end-products using HPL, such as elements, countertops and window
sills. Our production facility in Baruth produces both HDF and MDF. The majority of our production facilities
have warehouse facilities, but we also outsource some of our warehouse logistics to an external service provider.

We aim to align our production capacity within our production facilities with the demand for our products in
the markets in which we are active, as capacity utilization is a key strength in our industry. We estimate that total
engineered wood production capacity in Western Europe has been reduced significantly since 2005. This was
primarily due to the financial crisis in the late 2000s, which rendered some production facilities uneconomical.
Given such reduced capacity, utilization rates among engineered wood manufacturing facilities in the DACH
region have been stable since 2012 at over 90% compared to approximately 80% in 2009. Despite the COVID-19
pandemic, our production facilities had stable capacity utilization of nearly 90% with respect to our basic
products as well as our value-added products and approximately 80% for our high value-added products in the
year ended December 31, 2020. Despite our high capacity utilization, our production facilities have capacity to
expand production, including of high value-added products, as a result of our investments. We have invested
approximately €158 million in our Engineered Wood Products production facilities since 2011, which has
provided us with an efficient manufacturing base that benefits from numerous productivity increasing
enhancements. As a result of our investments and the fact that much of our plant and equipment can be replaced
on a modular basis, we have a low level of maintenance capital expenditure, which between 2018 and 2019
averaged €27.7 million annually for our Engineered Wood Product division. In the year ended December 31,
2020, maintenance capital expenditure was €29.1 million, as a result of a strategic reduction as part of our cost
saving measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditures”. We believe that_
we have well-invested equipment and expect to invest only in select efficiency projects going forward.

Typically, the larger the production facility, the higher the capacity of the facility. In 2020, the annual
average capacity of our production facilities was 600,000 m³ for particle boards and 450,000 m³ for MDF/HDF.
The capacity of our production facilities is in line with the average capacity of the production facilities of our
four key competitors, whose average facility size ranges from 400,000 m[3] to 650,000 m[3]. The large size of our
production facilities allows us to be more efficient with increased buying power in respect of raw material
purchases and agreements with third-party logistics providers, making us one of only few players in our area that
can supply products on a large volume basis. Our proximity to key customer groups allow us to provide more
tailored offerings to our customers and fulfill smaller orders with lower transportation costs and higher margins.
As of December 31, 2020, after giving effect to the Transactions, the ratio of our total net debt to the total
appraisal value of our assets (based on an insurance appraisal performed in the second quarter of 2020) was
approximately 1.5x and the ratio of our total net debt to the total replacement value of our assets (based on
competitors benchmark) was approximately 2.9x.

In addition to our production facilities, we lease our corporate headquarters in Neumarkt, which we use for
administrative, technical, sales and distribution purposes.

**Silekol**

**_Our Products_**

Our Silekol division produces a full spectrum of industrial and specialty resins, and accounted for 11% of
our consolidated net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, excluding inter-division sales. We focus on
specialty resins, which are manufactured for specific functions that are not commonly found in our industry, and
which generate higher margins than widely-available industrial resins. We sell our resins to external customers,
primarily in the German and Polish wood-based panel production, packaging, construction and building materials
industries. We also sell our resins to Panel East on the basis of the Panel East Resin Supply Agreement, which
was entered into between our Silekol division and Panel East in connection with the Silekol Transfer. In addition,
our Silekol division operates as a vertically integrated in-house resins manufacturer and supplies resins to our
Engineered Wood Products division for use in manufacturing our engineered wood products, including on an
exclusive basis for certain products. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold approximately 408 kT of
resin, 181 kT of which we sold to external customers, 114 kT of which we sold to Panel East and 113 kT of
which we used for our internal processes in the Engineered Wood Products division.

The following graphs illustrate the breakdown of our Silekol division’s net sales by product, customer and
geography for the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Specialty Resins_

We produce value-added specialty resins, melamine-urea formaldehyde resins (“MUF”), melamine-ureaphenol formaldehyde resins (“MUPF”) and phenol formaldehyde (“PF”) resins, which are also known as rezole
resins. These specialty resins are used as binding agents for composite, chipboards, impregnated paper and paper
laminates. PF resins are used as binding agents for special panels of composite boards, plywood, construction,
furniture, packaging and mineral wool. UF resins, MF resins and PF resins are also impregnating resins used as
binding agents for paper and paper laminates. Specialty resins accounted for 24% of our Silekol division’s net
sales in the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Industrial Resins_

We produce value-added industrial urea formaldehyde (“UF”) resins and urea-melamine formaldehyde
(“UMF”) resins. UF and UMF resins are used as binding agents for composite and chipboards. Industrial resins
accounted for 74% of our Silekol division’s net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Other Chemicals_

We produce other chemicals, such as formaldehyde, hardeners, resin fillers, NOX-catchers, plasticizer for
impregnating resins and concrete modifiers (in powder and liquid form).

**_Our Customers and End-Markets_**

Our Silekol division is the third largest resin manufacturer by volume in Central and Eastern Europe, where
we generate the majority of our net sales from customers in the German and Polish wood-based panel production,
packaging, construction and building materials industries. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated
74% of our Silekol division’s net sales from sales of our industrial resins to customers in the wood-based panel
production industry and 24% of our Silekol division’s net sales from sales of our specialty resins to customers in
the packaging, construction and building materials industries. We generated 45% and 41% of our gross sales in
the Silekol division from Poland and Germany, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020.

As of December 31, 2020, our Silekol division had over 200 active customers. The top ten external
customers of our Silekol division represented 61% of the external net sales generated by our Silekol division
(excluding sales to our Engineered Wood Products division and Panel East) in the year ended December 31,
2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, no single external customer accounted for more than 6% of the
Silekol division’s net sales for that period. We have a loyal customer base and a significant number of our
customers, including most of our top ten customers, have been our customers for more than ten years. Key
customers in our Silekol division include Nolte, DDL, Sonae Arauco, Paged, Rauch, Homanit and Lombardo.

Resins have a limited ability to travel, including because they typically have a short shelf-life of a maximum
of four weeks and are sensitive to the temperature at which they are stored, which helps insulate us from global
competition.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, our Silekol division generated 27% of its net sales from the sale of
resins to our our Engineered Wood Products division. In the same year, our Silekol division generated 28% of its
net sales from the sale of resins to Panel East. As part of our strategic growth initiatives to increase profitability,
we intend to increase our production of resins with the goal of increasing the percentage of sales to external
customers from approximately 45% to 50%.

For a description of our Panel East Resin Supply Agreement, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party
_Transactions.”_

**_Our Production Facilities_**

We currently operate one resin production facility in Poland, which provides cost-efficient access to both
Western and Central European markets. Our resin production facility includes three formaldehyde production
lines and 13 batch reactors, divided into 11 reactors for amino resins (including urea and melamine impregnation
resins, UF and MF) and two reactors dedicated for rezole resins (including rezole impregnation resins). We
employed 121 employees (full-time equivalents) at these facilities as of December 31, 2020, including employees
that were temporarily furloughed under COVID-19-related measures.

The production process at our Polish production facilities comprises two key steps: the production of
formaldehyde and the production of resin. Our formaldehyde production facility has a capacity of 143 kT, and

134


-----

oxidizes methanol with the aid of metal catalysts to produce formaldehyde and subsequently use excess steam to
produce power. Our eleven batch reactors have a capacity of 517 kT, and “cook” formaldehyde, urea and other
additives (such as melamine) to produce resin, which is then transferred to cooling or storage tanks. The entire
production process is supervised and controlled by our Batch Computer System to automate our processes as
much as possible, leading to proper control of raw material consumption and utilities. For example, our Batch
Computer System—DELTAV incorporates dosing technology specifically fitted to our reactors in order to
automate the input of ingredients for specific resin production recipes. In addition, we use The New Advanced
(Automatic) Resin Technology, a modern tool for production of new innovative resins with automatic process
control.

The following table provides an overview of our resin production facility in Poland.

We aim to align our production capacity in our production facility with the demand for our products in the
markets in which we are active, as capacity utilization is a key strength in chemical industries. In 2020, the
annual capacity of our production facility was 517 kT of resins. We believe that our production facility is the
most modern among our competitors, with the average age of the production facilities of BASF, MetaDynea,
Lerg and Chemcom ranging between ten and 20 years, and that our capacity makes us one of the biggest
producers of resins in Central and Eastern Europe.

We have invested approximately €27 million in our Silekol production facilities since 2011, which has
provided us with an efficient manufacturing base that benefits from numerous productivity increasing
enhancements. For example, under our Project Heliex initiative, we installed a steam generator unit at one of our
formaldehyde plants to generate our own energy supply. We have also invested in creating new phenol capacity
at our resin production facility, which is operated by a team with the specific technical know-how to produce
these new products in-house. In addition, our new Advanced (Automatic) Resin Technology (“ART”) is a
modern tool for the production of new innovative resins. ART gives us the opportunity to create efficient gluing
systems with resins and hardeners to be used for the production of ecological panels, and design resins according
to our customers’ needs. As a result of our investments and the fact that much of our plant and equipment can be
replaced on a modular basis, we have a low level of maintenance capital expenditure, which between 2018 and
2020 averaged €0.9 million annually for our Silekol division, with capital expenditure in the year ended
December 31, 2020 strategically reduced as part of our cost saving measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.
With our historical spend on growth and expansion projects substantially complete, we expect to invest in select
efficiency projects in the future that have a short payback period.

**Research and Development**

As a leader in product quality and innovation, we consider research and development to be among the key
factors in the development of new processes for a more efficient and sustainable use of raw materials and the
further development of our product offerings and brands. Within our Engineered Wood Products division, we
developed Duropal XTerior Compact in 2019 as an addition to our value-added product portfolio, an easy-to
process, ultra-matte laminate for outdoor use. In 2020, we developed Compact worktops, new surfaces which
meet current demand for haptic, smooth and matt surfaces that are easy to clean. Moreover, within our Silekol
division, we have the technical know-how necessary to make resin recipes in-house to cater to growing customer
needs, which allowed us to commence our specialty phenolic resin production in 2018. We seek to achieve
further growth in existing and new markets through a strong pipeline of new products, including high-margin
value-added products that differentiate us from our competitors. In addition, in line with our strong focus on
further increasing the sustainability of our business, we continuously strive to reduce our wood consumption
through the cascading utilization of wood through multiple processing stages and closed-loop recycling while not
compromising product quality. See “—Environmental, Social and Governance and Sustainability.”

Our current research and development activities primarily aim to improve our products’ finishes. In
particular, our goal is to expand the characteristics of the finish of our HPL products by combining or

135


-----

complementing them with varnish characteristics. For example, all of our decorative panel product lines,
including our decorative MDF/HDF lines, are customizable by the customer who can choose the décor, surface
and core materials to suit its needs. As part of our unique DST system (Décor, Surface and Träger), we have
approximately 130 décors, 11 surface textures and 13 core panel materials, through which we can create over
20,000 different wood-based panel combinations to offer solutions for a variety of trades, regardless of whether
the elements will be installed horizontally, vertically, play a functional role or are simply decorative. We offer an
extensive range of plain color, wood reproduction, stone and creative decors, which can be combined with
design- and application-oriented surface textures on a variety of core materials from chipboard, fiberboard and
fire protection and moisture-resistant panels for classic furniture and interior design to special core materials such
as LivingBoard for ecological construction. In addition, our pre-manufactured and customizable panel options
are available in a range of prices with short lead-times, all with consistent quality due to our well-invested
equipment. We also developed digital printing techniques to offer our customers the opportunity to customize
products even further. Building on our research and development experience, we are currently developing new
types of decorative surfaces that combine the haptic advantages of varnishes and foils with the hardness and
durability of laminates.

In addition, we organize customer workshops and cooperation projects with our customers to understand
their needs and generate ideas for new or improved products. For example, by collaborating with one of our
customers in the kitchen industry, we introduced the award-winning worktop, Xtra, in 2019. The Xtra board is
significantly more impact-resistant and less sensitive to water penetration and swelling than a conventional
board. These properties therefore enable, among other things, flush-mounted installation of sinks and cooking
hobs.

**Environmental, Social and Governance and Sustainability**

Wood, an inherently sustainable resource, has been at the core of our focus for more than 125 years. The
renewable nature of wood, our single most important raw material, has historically played a major role in shaping
our corporate culture. Over the last several decades, we have established a strong focus on Environmental, Social
and Governance (“ESG”) and sustainability trends in our key end-markets. This is supported by our sustainable
manufacturing process focused on protecting the environment, while not compromising the high quality of our
products.

**_Sustainability Goals and Wood Utilization_**

In order to protect the environment and meet sustainability needs, we focus primarily on optimizing the use
of our raw materials, from sourcing and processing to transportation and recycling, increasing the percentage of
recycled wood used in our products in place of fresh wood to produce fully sustainable products, improving our
energy efficiency and production processes, avoiding any form of environmental pollution, reducing our Scope 1
& 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions and minimizing waste production.

We estimate that recycled wood represented approximately 40% of the total wood we used in 2020
compared to approximately 38% in 2018, and we have committed to increase this share to at least 44% by the
end of 2022 and 50% by the end of 2025. Based on management data and a report prepared for us by a leading
international consulting firm, the share of recycled wood we use in our products is significantly higher than those
of one of our key competitors, one of the few to make such information public, which was approximately 21% in
2020. In addition, we estimate that in the year ended December 31, 2020, industrial wood, which is used as
pre-consumer recycling material, represented approximately 44% of total wood used, increasing the share of
overall recycled materials used in our products to approximately 84%

We focus on the sustainable sourcing of wood and constantly endeavor to increase the share of recycled
wood used in our products. By increasing the amount of recycled wood used in our products, we are able to
decrease our use of fresh wood and lower our overall raw material costs and increase our margins. At the same
time, utilizing recycled wood in our manufacturing processes allows us to meet the increasing demand for
sustainable products in our end-markets. This is coupled with the growing willingness by our end-customers to
pay higher prices for environmentally friendly products.

We are among the first in the industry to use closed-loop recycling of wood waste and cascading utilization
of wood, which consists of the efficient utilization of wood as a resource through multiple processing stages,
from harvesting to recycling and energy recovery. We believe that the cascading utilization of wood is the only
wood utilization model that can guarantee sustainable production of high quality, innovative wood products,
while relieving the burden on forestry and reducing our overall footprint on the environment. In addition, the

136


-----

sustainable production of goods and, in particular, cascading utilization and closed-loop recycling management,
are an increasing focus of our customers and our partner companies, which are becoming more and more
sensitive to sustainability and environmental concerns. We will continue to strengthen partnerships with external
stakeholders, including innovative and certified recycling companies, furniture manufacturers, suppliers and
customers to promote the cascading utilization of wood and closed-loop recycling to increase the supply of
recycled wood in our production process. We have made dedicated and meaningful capital investments in order
to increase the share of recycled wood used in our products.

Our cascading utilization cycles comprise the following key stages: (i) we source logs of fresh wood from
sustainable forestry and deliver them to sawmills where they are cut in bars and planks; (ii) we collect industrial
wood, consisting of thinning, chips and residual wood as well as sawdust and other sawing residues and obtain
pre-consumer recycling material, (iii) we process pre-consumer recycling material together with fresh wood and
post-consumer recycled wood through sorting, gluing, compacting and pressing to produce wood-based
materials, such as wood fiber boards; (iv) we supply finished wood and wood-based products to our customers;
(v) at the end of their service life, we dismantle used wood and wood-based products and process them in
accordance with applicable laws through innovative and sophisticated technologies and waste management
systems, whereby we remove minerals and metallic components as well as chemical and organic impurities;
(vi) we re-use high quality recycled wood as post-consumer recycled material for the production of new woodbased products; and (vii) we convert wood that can no longer be recycled into thermal and electric energy at our
integrated biomass power plants in Gütersloh, Neumarkt and Baruth, where we also operate as a certified waste
management company, using such energy in our production processes and feed any surplus electricity into the
public electricity network.

In order to protect the environment, meet sustainability needs and contribute to the mitigation of the effects
of climate change, we also focus on minimizing environmental pollution and, in particular, on reducing our
Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions. We estimate that in 2020 we generated approximately 220.2 kT of
Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions compared to approximately 238.5 kT and approximately 270.6 kT in
2019 and 2018, respectively. Overall, we estimate that we reduced Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions by
approximately 26% from 2013 to 2020. We have committed to reduce our Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas
Emissions to 201.7 kT by the end of 2022 and to 173.9 kT by the end of 2025, in each case from 220.2 kT in
2020. We also estimate that approximately 95% of the electricity we used in 2020 came from carbon-neutral
biomass produced at our CHP plants.

In addition to benefitting the environment, our meaningful investment in our recycled wood capacity also
meaningfully enhances our relative cost position as recycled wood is cheaper to source than fresh wood.
Furthermore, our commitment to reducing our Scope 1 & Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions, which we have
focused on since the introduction of our emission-free LivingBoard in 1987, meaningfully enhances the
attractiveness of our products to our sustainability-conscious end customers.

**_Sustainability of Other Raw Materials_**

In addition to continuously focusing on increasing our use of recycled wood, we aim to ensure the
sustainability of other raw materials used in our production process, such as glue, by striving to use
formaldehyde- reduced and formaldehyde-free solutions. For example, our LivingBoard panels, which were
introduced to the market in 1987, are made with formaldehyde-free glue and have been given the “Blue Angel”
certification, the ecolabel of the federal government of Germany. The gluing of our raw chipboard and fiberboard
is carried out in closed systems and we are continuously researching to improve glue formulas.

In addition, we only use paper for decor coating. We process up to 9,000 tonnes of decor paper per year. For
impregnation, we use melamine resin or a mixture of melamine resin and urea to impregnate the paper before it is
applied to the chipboard on the laying belt under heat and pressure. We produce the resins for the melamine and
phenol impregnation of our high-pressure laminate (HPL) boards ourselves to ensure the high durability and
homogeneity of the HPL products.

At our Arnsberg plant, we test our boards for impurities, organ halogen compounds such as PCP and
chlorine, and measure formaldehyde emissions in our own test chambers in order to guarantee the safety of our
products.

**_Certifications_**

Our commitment to sustainability and environmental protection is underlined by the complete certification
of all processes along the entire value chain. All of our six manufacturing plants hold sustainability certifications

137


-----

such as ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 50001. In addition, we are a member of the Quality Association for
Wood-based Panels and all the fresh wood we process at our plants comes from sustainably managed forests
typically certified by FSC[®] (the Forest Stewardship Council), which sets out clear requirements aimed at
safeguarding existing fauna and flora as well as promoting biodiverse reforestation. We also utilize wood from
companies certified by PEFC (the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes) which
ensures that the wood supplied was originally sourced from FSC-compliant forests. See also “—Procurement
_and Purchasing of Raw Materials—Wood.” Our strong commitment to sustainability and environmental_
protection is also testified by the recognition of an increasing number of our engineered wood products as Cradle
to Cradle Certified[™], a globally recognized measure of safer, more sustainable products made for the circular
economy, which is awarded based on the environmental and social performance of products across five critical
sustainability categories: material health, material reuse, renewable energy and carbon management, water
stewardship, and social fairness.

**_Employees and Communities_**

The commitment to sustainability is an integral part to our corporate culture and lies at the core of our
relationship with our employees, customers, suppliers and the broader society in which we operate. We strive to
ensure a safe, fair and inclusive working environment for our employees and place great importance on diversity
and inclusion as well as talent recruitment and management. In particular, we endeavor to safeguard the health
and safety of our employees by constantly upgrading our production facilities and equipment with the latest
technologies and utilizing effective maintenance strategies. In addition, we maintain safety equipment and
provide various practice-oriented safety trainings on a regular basis. In 2016, we began our current “One Safety”
program, under which we train and instruct our managers and supervisors to create a safe workplace environment
for all of our employees toward our target of zero workplace accidents. In addition, through our “Five minutes
for safety” initiative, we aim to increase awareness about work-place safety by ensuring that safety is discussed
during every daily meeting at all of our plants. In addition, in 2020 we have implemented multiple single
improvement actions, including in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, which we believe will contribute to an
overall reduction in the risk of accidents at our facilities.

Overall, we place a great importance on our corporate social responsibility and our public image and
endeavor to apply the highest ethical and legal standards when shaping our strategic goals and in our daily
business activities, and we strive to incorporate ethical and social responsibility principles in our internal
guidelines and procedures. We act in close adherence to all applicable regulations and government guidelines and
expect our suppliers, customers and other business partners to also operate in compliance thereof.

Furthermore, we give our employees extensive opportunities to develop their skills and talents and
encourage them to make suggestions for process improvements through a bonus system. In addition to training
courses on their work and job security, we promote the environmental awareness of the people who work for us
through training courses.

In addition, we work to support the communities in which we operate and seek to give back to local
communities through impactful community projects to promote the local cultural and sports landscape as well as
support social and environmental campaigns and the local fire brigades, for example by investing in new
equipment, digital radio alarm receivers and other fire-fighting aids.

**Sales and Marketing**

**_Sales_**

_Overview_

Our Engineered Wood Products division sells our products in approximately 60 countries and provides
quality customer service, including product consultations, to key European markets through our service

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 201 employees (full-time equivalents) in sales and
marketing in our Engineered Wood Products division, including employees which were temporarily furloughed
under COVID-19-related measures.

_Sales Channel_

In our Engineered Wood Products division, in order to exploit the full potential of our customer base, we
sell our products through both direct sales channels (directly to customers operating in our end-markets) and
indirect sales channels (to wholesalers, retailers and other distributors that sell to their customers operating in our
end-markets).

   - Our direct sales channel allows us to maintain longstanding relationships with our customers, who are
typically medium to large sized industry customers. As our sales strategy in this channel is to pursue
needs-based selling, we focus on identifying and fulfilling our direct customers’ preferences and
requirements for products. Our sales representatives in our direct sales channel comprise end-market
specialists and key account managers for major direct customers.

   - Our indirect sales channel, through which we sell to wholesalers, retailers and other distributors, allows
us to effectively serve smaller end customers and efficiently serve a range of accounts, including
globally. We frequently partner with distributors to engage directly with, and best fit the needs of, our
end customers in order to deepen customer insights and build brand awareness and loyalty. Our sales
representatives in our indirect sales channel comprise generalists covering a wide span of products for
dedicated regions, as well as a dedicated team of object consultants to support particular end-market
businesses.

In our Silekol division, we sell our products directly to customers operating in our end-markets. We focus
on identifying and fulfilling our direct customers’ preferences and requirements for products. This approach
similarly allows us to maintain longstanding relationships with our customers.

_Sales Teams_

Our sales teams have a deep understanding of the markets they serve and our product details and intended
applications, have strong commercial acumen to negotiate costs and margins and work alongside our customers
to understand their specific needs. In particular, our object consultants are end-market specialists who each
support customers in particular industries.

Since profitability can vary considerably between end-markets and individual customers, our sales teams
actively manage our customer portfolio by focusing on higher-margin businesses. We implement a targeted
customer approach with clear and actionable segmentation of customers by sales and margin potential,
considered together with other factors, such as loyalty and payment morale.

In order to ensure we have full coverage in all the regions we operate, we have developed longstanding
relationships with certain key distributors and merchants, sometimes spanning over 30 years. We have a number
of preferred suppliers that generally do not operate on an exclusive basis, but cooperate closely with our sales
teams and benefit from our sales and marketing support, making us in turn their preferred producer.

Compensation for our sales teams is partly performance-based, creating an entrepreneurial culture and high
commitment to our business, which is reflected in generally low turnover rates on our sales teams.

_Pricing Strategies_

We employ strategic pricing, with a two-pronged approach to first set prices through cost transparency after
optimizing price targets for different products and customer groups and then make sales through adjustments or
discounts for specific customers and/or large order volumes. For our basic products and some value-added
products, such as MFC, we generally renegotiate prices and volumes with our customers on a quarterly or semiannual basis. For products sold to our retail purchasers, we operate with price lists which we typically update
once or twice per year, except for raw chipboard (P2-P3), where prices are agreed on a quarterly basis for some
key customers. For products sold to the kitchen, furniture and construction end-markets, pricing is typically set at
an agreed amount until further notice, offering us the flexibility to change our pricing, if and as needed, at a later
point during the relationship with the customer. We agree with our customers on a non-exclusive basis to
produce the value-added and high-value added products in the combinations they purchase available during the
life of each collection, which typically is between three and five years. This consistency of supply is of particular
importance to our customers in the kitchen and furniture industry to ensure stability of their products.

139


-----

Pricing of our products is dependent on various factors, such as the cost of the underlying raw materials, the
features and quality of products, supply and demand in our markets and the nature of, and the dynamics in, our
customers’ businesses and industries. Pricing for our products is also dependent on the history and the
relationship we have with the customer, the exclusivity agreements and the utilization rate of the relevant product
line. Our larger customers, including certain industrial manufacturers, take advantage of ordering in larger
volumes, whereas our smaller customers, including certain retail customers, typically order smaller quantities.
The individual customer’s order size is reflected in the price level that can be achieved when negotiating with
customers, in some cases resulting in a surcharge for small orders. We also produce weekly, monthly and
quarterly reports relating to price, volume and margin developments and sales, to help the sales team better
understand their performance and market environment. The trends of our price development have generally been
in line with the market over the last five years, although we have also been able to maintain a premium over the
average market prices in our core markets. Furthermore, in the last years we have been able to achieve a positive
price pass through of sales prices compared to raw material prices dynamics.

**_Marketing_**

Our marketing strategy is designed to reach, consult and collaborate with decision makers responsible for
the use and purchase of our products, such as architects, developers, civil engineers, builders, builder merchants,
carpenters and distribution partners.

We use several types of marketing strategies, including trade fairs, seminars, customer events, joint
customer visits, advertisements, targeted mailings, promotions and marketing campaigns. Training, brochures,
technical documentation and online activities (such as central and regional websites, social networks, apps and
marketing movies) also play an important role in our marketing activities. We are transitioning to using digital
marketing techniques in order to increase the scope of our target groups as well as our marketing efficiency.

Our brand strategy focuses on our umbrella brand Pfleiderer, which is used throughout our business and
across engineered wood products. In addition, we use the established sub-brands Duropal and Thermopal. We
believe that we benefit from the broad recognition of our brands and their reputation for quality and proven
material characteristics, and our offering of customer-specific building and design solutions.

**Procurement and Purchasing of Raw Materials**

Our global sourcing strategy is coordinated by sourcing teams, which negotiate price lists and payment
targets with our suppliers based on the aggregate purchasing volume, thereby leveraging our group-wide scale.
Individual orders are then placed by the division receiving the order. We project annual purchasing volumes
based on our budget and continuously update our strategy throughout the year. Our teams integrate purchasing
and production specialists to realistically assess needs, optimize inventories of raw materials and reduce material
consumption. Other than as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, since 2004, we have not experienced any
incidents of having to interrupt production for lack of supplies.

We generally manage the purchase of our all of our key raw materials carefully and tend to solicit pricing
from multiple suppliers in order to maintain negotiating leverage and ensure security of supply. In order to ensure
an adequate level of supply, we attempt to reduce risks by diversifying our supply chain and purchasing raw
materials strategically in a combination of bulk and spot rate purchases. We incentivize our sourcing teams to
negotiate purchases of raw materials below the applicable spot rate. We have generally been able to pass on price
increases of raw materials and other costs of sales to our customers as a result of strategic pricing. In our
Engineered Wood Products division, we typically manage pass-through of costs by raising our prices for
incoming contracts and contract renewals. We typically enter into supply agreements with a duration of three, six
or twelve months to cover a significant portion of our raw material requirements. This has allowed us to mitigate
the effect of rising or fluctuating raw material costs on our business. We typically purchase wood and paper one
quarter in advance at fixed prices, electricity in advance for the whole year and chemicals one month or one
quarter in advance. Our contract prices are set by our integrated supply chain management function, which
continuously reviews the price index for our raw materials to determine appropriate pricing terms and will seek
to raise the prices we charge our customers as raw material prices rise. In our Silekol division, we typically agree
the pass-through directly in our customer contracts by tying the purchase price of our products to the price index
for methanol, urea, melamine and phenol (benzene).

In the year ended December 31, 2020, our top ten external suppliers accounted for approximately 50% of
our raw material costs. The key raw materials we purchase include wood, chemicals, paper and energy.

140


-----

In the year ended December 31, 2020, the expense for raw materials and energy used in the production by
our Engineered Wood Products division amounted to €310.6 million, or 45%, of divisional net sales. In the same
period, the expense for raw materials and energy used in the production by our Silekol division amounted to
€86.9 million, or 72% of divisional net sales.

**_Wood_**

Wood is our single most important raw material and accounted for 26% of the Engineered Wood Products
division’s overall raw material and energy costs in the year ended December 31, 2020. We have three primary
sources of wood: (a) fresh wood, or wood sourced directly from forests or wood-farms; (b) industrial wood,
which is residue and chips from saw mills; and (c) recycled wood, which is used and reprocessed wood from the
construction industry or our own manufacturing processes. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 it
became more difficult to source recycled wood, and we estimate that in the year ended December 31, 2020,
approximately 15% of the wood we used in our operations was fresh wood, approximately 45% was industrial
wood and approximately 40% was recycled wood. In contrast, we estimate approximately 16% of the wood we
used in our operations in the year ended December 31, 2018 was fresh wood, approximately 47% was industrial
wood and approximately 38% was recycled wood. Industrial wood and recycled wood, which together
constituted approximately 84% of our wood sources in the year ended December 31, 2020, are both cheaper and
a favorable selling point as our customers are increasingly interested in sustainable and environmentally friendly
products. Solid wood furniture is not generally common in the market due to modern trends and the
sophistication of products such as ours, which can resemble wood in addition to meeting additional customer
specifications such as color and texture preferences. In order to increase the share of recycled wood used in our
products, starting from 2021 we plan to invest further in debottlenecking actions to unlock our capacity to
produce higher quantities of recycled wood at our Neumarkt and Leutkirch facilities.

We also source wood from various suppliers in order to reduce the risk of disruptions to our supply. We
contract with suppliers that are local to each of our production facilities to source saw mill residue and recycled
wood, which we use in our raw chipboard and fiberboard production processes. In the year ended December 31,
2020, we purchased wood for an overall cost of €81.8 million from approximately 400 suppliers. Because of the
relatively low value of our wood raw materials relative to transport costs, it is most cost-effective for us to
contract with wood suppliers within approximately 150 to 200 kilometers of a production facility. However, we
also procure wood from global sources, such as producers in the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Denmark,
Finland, Switzerland, Austria and Lithuania, to prevent dependencies from local market dislocations, to
opportunistically benefit from attractive spot prices or exchange rate effects and as a tool to maintain negotiating
leverage.

We use a proprietary forecasting model to manage our wood product purchasing, which we typically make a
fiscal quarter in advance. The use of this model has generated cost advantages when compared to the industry
average prices for raw materials, such as wood chips and wood shavings.

To control our supply and support sustainable forestry, we seek to only source wood from suppliers who are
able to verify the district of origin for “controlled wood,” which refers to wood from sustainably managed or
certified forests or recycled wood. In sourcing wood, we adhere to ecological, social and economic standards set
by the PEFC[™] (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification) and FSC[®] (Forest Stewardship
Council). We do not use wood from exhaustive cultivation or forest destruction. See “—Environmental, Social
_and Governance and Sustainability—Certifications.”_

Furthermore, in order to optimize costs and increase productivity, we launched a new wood recycling
facility in Neumarkt in 2018 and have also increased the share of recycled wood that we purchase from our
suppliers. This has resulted in a reduction in our wood procurement costs by approximately €34.7 million during
the period from 2018 to 2020, without giving effect to fresh wood market price fluctuations.

In addition, in most of our production facilities, we run biomass CHPs plants or other biomass incineration
production facilities, allowing us to convert the timber that we discard for quality reasons, and other waste
timber, into energy for our production processes. The majority of our energy needs are covered by our own
biomass-based CHP plants. We cover our additional electricity needs by entering into annual contracts for
approximately 60% to 70% of our additional electricity demand as well as short-term forward contracts for a
further 20% to 30% of the energy we purchase.

141


-----

**_Chemicals_**

The manufacture of the products produced by each of our divisions involves the use of chemicals. For our
Engineered Wood Products division, we purchase resins, glues and additives in order to create the wood-based
products we sell to our customers. Our Engineered Wood Products division sources a portion of these chemicals
from the Silekol division and also contracts with third-party suppliers in order to reduce the risk of disruptions to
our supply. We typically purchase such chemicals a month in advance. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we
purchased chemicals for our Engineered Wood Products division for an overall cost of €94.2 million from our
suppliers, of which €32.3 million, or 34%, was purchased from our Silekol division, in total accounting for 30%
of the total raw material and energy costs for our Engineered Wood Products division.

Our Silekol division also purchases certain chemicals in order to manufacture its resins, glues and additives.
The key ingredients we use in the production of our own resins, glues and additives are urea, methanol, melamine
and phenol. These ingredients are commodities with relatively transparent pricing in the global market. For some
of our raw material supply agreements, our purchase price is tied to a price index and, for other of our raw
material supply agreements, we specifically negotiate discounts and rebates based primarily on our purchase
volumes. These discounts and rebates help us counteract, among other things, regulatory drivers of the cost of
chemicals, including formaldehyde, that may otherwise set higher costs. In the year ended December 31, 2020,
we purchased chemicals for our Silekol division for an overall cost of €83.2 million from our suppliers, which
accounted for 96% of our total raw material and energy costs of our Silekol division.

**_Paper_**

We contract with global paper suppliers to source the décor paper and technical paper used in the production
of our decorative wood-based panel boards. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased paper for an
overall cost of €64.4 million from our suppliers, which accounted for 21% of our total raw material and energy
costs in our Engineered Wood Products division. By sourcing our papers globally from our headquarters, we are
able to reduce prices by bundling volumes and minimize contract negotiations. We operate a single sourcing
strategy for specific items of décor paper whereby we choose a single supplier to maximize purchase volumes
even though other comparable suppliers exist in the supplier base, still allowing us to switch suppliers if
necessary. This allows us to forge strategic partnerships with our supplier, which result in a higher quality
products at lower total costs. We employ a dual sourcing strategy for the remainder of our paper raw materials.
We typically purchase paper a fiscal quarter in advance.

**_Energy_**

We contract with suppliers of electricity, gas, wood and other biomass products to be used for own
consumption needs and as fuel in our CHP plants to provide us with the majority of the thermal energy necessary
to run our production facilities. We also operate our own CHP plants in Neumarkt, Gütersloh and Baruth,
Germany, with an overall installed thermal output of 271MW and an overall installed electrical output of 52MW,
which are fueled by biomass or natural gas. In addition, we installed an electricity generation unit at our Silekol
production facility, which became fully operational in December 2019. We have ceased the use of heavy heating
oil in our production facilities in Germany due to increasing prices, environmental issues and limited competition
among suppliers and replaced this energy source with natural gas and biomass. In the year ended December 31,
2020, we purchased energy in an aggregate purchase price of €22.9 million (after energy reliefs) from our
suppliers, which accounted for 6% of our total raw materials and energy costs.

Energy cost is affected by various factors, including the availability of supply of particular sources of
energy as well as regulatory decisions. To mitigate the effects of fluctuating energy prices, we assess long-,
middle- and short-term expectations for energy prices and enter into yearly contracts to hedge approximately
70% to 80% of our electricity demand and short-term futures contracts to hedge a further 20% to 30% of our
energy supply. We also actively manage the energy usage at our production facilities to avoid expensive
electricity peak loads. Energy costs are also affected by regulatory decisions. For example, in Germany, our
energy costs are directly affected by relief benefits that we are granted annually, including the EEG relief for
energy intensive consumers, grid cost relief and energy tax relief for highly efficient CHP plants like ours, which
amounted to a total of €6.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we have historically
received grid cost reliefs in three plants (Gütersloh, Neumarkt and Baruth) which amounted €3.6 million per
year, and a concession relief of €0.4 million.

While we use the heat produced in our CHP plants for our production processes, we also sell the electricity
generated to the grid. Our energy sales further benefit from government pricing incentives through a state
142


-----

granted fixed “EEG feed-in tariff” because we produce energy from renewable sources. In 2020, the price
guarantee under the EEG feed-in tariff was extended until 2026 for all our biomass CHP plants, with a
progressive phasing out starting from 2023. While such extension came into force under German energy law, it
remains subject to final approval by the European Commission, which is currently expected in the second quarter
of 2021. If the European Commission does not approve the extension or, in any event, if the price guarantee is
not renewed after its new expiration date, we will no longer be able to sell electricity at the price guarantee under
the EEG feed-in tariff and we will have to conduct electricity sales at market rates that are subject to fluctuation
over time. As a result of the currently scheduled progressive reduction of the EEG feed-in tariff, we currently
estimate our net sales form energy sales will progressively decrease over the coming years. We plan to offset a
small portion of this reduction through operational initiatives, but we believe the net impact to Adjusted EBITDA
of our energy sales will be €1.1 million in 2021, €2.3 million in 2022 and €7.9 million in 2023. Given the high
degree of flexibility of our power plants, we also partner with utility companies to participate in their grid load
management, which means that at times of high loads, which may be caused by weather-dependent high output
of wind or solar power generation, we are paid for temporarily reducing the electricity output of our CHP plants,
thereby reducing the stress on the grid.

As a result of our recycling practices, the use of heat we produce, the sale of the electricity we generate and
self-water generation, we are able to typically offset volume-driven increases in freight and other costs related to
sourcing our energy externally.

Moreover, our ongoing projects aim to further optimize our production network and reduce complexity,
improve efficiency and standardize pricing across our business to continue to reduce costs and increase
profitability. These projects include revised production processes, such as implementing more efficient glue
application methods, improved processes to load wood into production machines, better product recipes and
revised sales processes that set more effective target prices toward margin contribution.

**_Water_**

Furthermore, we require and recycle water in our production processes. We use wastewater, which remains
after cleaning facility parts or washing and shredding chippings, directly in our production processes, including
by mixing water for glue. After any remaining wastewater is vaporized, the distillate is fed back into our
production process. In November 2019, we also completed the replacement of mechanical water seals at our
Silekol production facility, enabling us to source our own water from an on-site well in which we installed new
filters.

**Logistics**

Our integrated supply chain management (“SCM”) function serves as a link between our supply,
manufacturing and distribution operations. Based on our budget, SCM continuously updates our supply forecasts
based with details of volumes, timing and production plans to optimize capacity utilization and inventory levels.
SCM also oversees the delivery logistics of our decentralized delivery system.

Our logistics management focuses on improvements in service and inventory levels along our supply chain,
both during the movement of goods from our suppliers to us and the movement of products from us to our
customers. Delivery times to the customer’s location depend on the type of product and final destination. We
typically travel an average distance of approximately 400 kilometers to deliver products to customers from our
Engineered Wood Products division and, in our Silekol division, we typically travel up to 850 kilometers to
deliver industrial resins and up to 1,200 kilometers to deliver specialty resins from our Silekol division.

Deliveries for our Engineered Wood Products division are mostly made as full truck loads. Where
customers order small quantities, we consolidate different customer orders into a single truck to achieve a full
truck load. A single delivery truck can therefore have multiple unloading points to serve different customers’
delivery addresses. We generally distribute our products within a radius of 50 to 600 kilometers depending on the
product, which is partially due to our production facilities being located close to our key customers. To the extent
required, in particular with transportation over longer distances, we increasingly review alternative transport
solutions, such as transport by train or ship. Our production facilities in Neumarkt and Baruth were strategically
built in close vicinity to railway stations.

Our Silekol division uses various delivery methods, including containers, trucks and block train wagons or
train shuttles. In each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, less than 5% of our customers collected
their product orders directly from our production facilities.

143


-----

As part of our cost savings initiatives, in 2020 we finalized the rationalization and specialization of our own
transportation fleet, reducing our fleet from 53 trucks in the year ended December 31, 2019 to 36 trucks as of
September 30, 2020, consisting of 28 walking-floor trucks, compared to 20 in 2019, and only five standard taut
liners and tanks for special transport needs. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position
_and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Cost and Efficiency Improvement_
_Initiatives—Logistics Cost Reduction Initiatives.”_

Our centrally-managed fleet of 36 leased trucks is operated by our subsidiary JURA-Spedition GmbH,
through which we carried out approximately 11% of our deliveries in the year ended December 31, 2020. Our
fleet consists of fuel-saving, Euro 6-compliant trucks, which enables us to achieve high levels of delivery
performance while reduction energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The remaining 89% of our transportation
needs are carried out by third parties, which are selected and managed centrally by JURA-Spedition GmbH. To
select the most cost-effective provider, we both cooperate with international and regional trucking companies on
a recurring basis pursuant to contractual agreements and purchase capacity in the spot market. We use internetbased tools for price transparency. JURA-Spedition GmbH also operates 28 walking-floor trucks which work in
round trips, transporting raw wood materials to our production facilities and transporting completed wood-based
panels outbound, resulting in capacity utilization rates of about 90%. This translates into competitive costs
compared to external providers. Our fleet of tanker trucks, which is used to deliver resin to our production
facilities, is also used as short-term mobile storage on weekends to optimize the level of supply at our production
facilities.

**Information Technology**

IT assists a significant portion of our business, and we have built control rooms to oversee our operations at
our production facilities and increased our use of automated machinery to improve efficiency and decrease labor
costs. We have a harmonized information technology infrastructure, whereby all back-end servers are on the
same hardware and software release. The wide-area network is a Pfleiderer multi-protocol label-switching
network hosted by a third-party provider. Our firewall is also monitored by a third-party provider. We have a
data center in Neumarkt and use SAP software hosted by a third-party provider. We have maintenance and
service contracts for all back-end systems.

**Intellectual Property**

We own several registered trademarks worldwide. Our significant trademarks include “Pfleiderer”,
“Thermopal”, “Duropal”, “DecoBoard”, “PrimeBoard” and “Silekol”, among others, and otherwise relate to
these brand names, our logos or our product names.

We also own various registered patent and patent applications worldwide, of which several are registered
under our Engineered Wood Products division and one of which is registered under our Silekol division.
Protection of process innovations and other technology is essential to our business. We rely upon unpatented
proprietary expertise, continuing technological process innovations and other trade secrets to develop and
maintain our competitive position. Additionally, we rely on confidentiality agreements with third-party
developers. We are also party to a series of licensing agreements relating to technical applications and production
methods.

We are not aware of any major legal proceedings that have been brought against us for infringement of a
patent or trademark or of any proceedings brought against any of our patents that could have a material adverse
effect on our business if we do not prevail in such proceedings.

**Environment and Health and Safety Regulations**

**_Overview_**

One of the key barriers to entry in our industry is the variety of regulations and standards to which we are
subject and the number of permits required to operate this business.

All of our operations require environmental permits, certificates and other approvals that are subject to
modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities, certain of which can take years to acquire. For
example, because all of our facilities emit carbon dioxide in the ordinary course of our operations, we are
required to possess emission rights in the EU. In the EU, the right to emit such gas is regulated, allotted and
granted by the competent public authorities. Our operating sites in Germany have sufficient emission rights for
their present operations, particularly because we benefit from certain privileges available to energy-intensive
production companies.

144


-----

We are subject to a wide range of environmental, health and safety requirements, including those governing
the control of atmospheric and water pollution, the use, handling, treatment, storage, transport and disposal of
chemicals, hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contaminated sites, the makeup of our products
and the protection of human health and safety. As an owner and as an operator of industrial properties, we are
subject to potential liabilities and obligations relating to environmental conditions, particularly contaminations of
soil, groundwater and buildings at our current facilities and former sites as well as neighboring properties,
including investigation, cleanup, containment, decommissioning or closure obligations.

**_Costs_**

In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we spent approximately €1.3 million, €2.1 million
and €0.5 million, respectively, on costs to comply with environmental requirements for our Engineered Wood
Products division and approximately €0.2 million, €0.1 million and €0.1 million, respectively, on costs to comply
with environmental requirements for our Silekol division. Costs include the use, handling, disposal of or
exposure to chemicals and hazardous substances (including waste and waste water) and the control of
atmospheric and water pollution. We have received permanent approval from the relevant EU authority to burn
our wood dust in our incineration plants. Our major environmental costs consists of the disposal of the ashes
generated in our power plants in Neumarkt, Gütersloh and Baruth.

Environmental, health and safety requirements change often and tend to become more stringent over time.
Additional laws and regulations, or changes in existing laws and regulations, in the future could increase our
costs or restrict our ability to manufacture or market our products.

**_Key Regulations and Standards_**

We are subject to the applicable laws and regulations of the respective jurisdictions in which we operate.

In particular, our production plants are subject to the IED, which was transposed into German law in 2020.
The IED provides for close monitoring and inspection of certain industrial plants by the competent authorities,
increased reporting duties for the relevant operators as well as enhanced public participation in administrative
decision-making processes. Furthermore, the IED also introduced an EU-wide regime of emission limit values
based on the BAT for each relevant industry sector. These emission limit values are adopted and updated at
regular intervals on the EU-level as part of BREFs and are subsequently required to be implemented in each EU
member state through binding national law. As a result of the IED, emission limit values have been lowered by
the authorities. We continue to monitor the potential impact of these regulations and determinations on our
business.

Under an integrated management system (“IMS”), we also adhere to the following standards: DIN EN ISO
9001 (for our quality management system), DIN EN ISO 14001 (for our environmental management system),
DIN EN ISO 50001 (for our energy management system), FSC/PEFC (for our sustainable forestry management
system), EfbV (according to the German Directive for Waste Management) and SQAS (for the CEFIC safety and
quality assessment system). Our efficient energy management system has received certification in all our German
production facilities to EN ISO 50001, the current global standard for energy management systems. Compliance
with these standards is an integral part of our business.

Additionally, we must comply with applicable decisions by the EU REACH Committee. For example, in
December 2013, the EU REACH Committee adopted a decision to reclassify formaldehyde as a “category 1B
carcinogen” (presumed to have carcinogenic potential for humans, classification largely based on animal
evidence). The reclassification of formaldehyde has significantly affected emission standards, workplace health
and safety regulations and other regulations applying to our products, resulting in lower limit values. As we have
historically used and continue to use formaldehyde as our primary bonding agent in the production of our woodbased panel products, we have made changes in our production processes in order to comply with the regulations
relating to the reclassification, such as the installation of new ventilation systems in our press hall and changes to
our gluing and board production systems. In February 2020, the European Commission published a regulation
classifying titanium dioxide as a “category 2 carcinogen” (presumed to have carcinogenic potential for humans,
classification largely based on animal evidence), which will apply starting from September 2021. In addition, we
cannot exclude the possibility that additional chemicals or other materials used in our production processes may
be formally designated as harmful or become subject to additional regulation. For example, in December 2020,
the risk assessment committee of the European Commission proposed to reclassify melamine, which is used in
our products, as a “category 2 carcinogen.” See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Market and Our Business—
_The EU REACH Committee previously reclassified formaldehyde and titanium dioxide as a carcinogen, and may_

145


-----

_do the same in the future in respect of additional chemicals or materials used in our production processes, which_
_could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”_

**Employees**

We receive employment applications by highly skilled workers and managers as well as young talent. We
invest in the development and training of our employees during apprenticeships and our human resources
department constantly monitors the development of our employees by tracking a qualification matrix as well as
discussing training plans with our employees.

The following table sets forth our number of employees (full-time equivalents) and apprentices by country
as of December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (including employees which have been temporarily furloughed under
COVID-19-related measures) for each of our Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions.

As part of our headcount optimization programs, we have been working to rationalize our headcount at our
production facilities as well as in certain sales back-office and administrative functions. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of_
_Operations—Cost and Efficiency Improvement Initiatives—Headcount reduction program—Manufacturing_
_Labor” and See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations—_
_Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Cost and Efficiency Improvement Initiatives—Headcount_
_reduction program—SG&A.”_

We have not suffered any material work stoppages or strikes in recent years, and we consider relations with
our employees, works councils and unions to be satisfactory. We are subject to collective bargaining agreements
(Tarifverträge) with most of our employees in our German production facilities and strikes may occur in
Germany and elsewhere at any time. Our current standard employment agreements were put in place in 2014, and
have provisions for flexible working hours (Betriebsvereinbarung zur Arbeitszeitflexibilierung) as well as traffic
light accounts (Ampelkonten), which create specified ranges of working hours for individual employees within
which no overtime bonuses are provided, or overtime accounts (Mehrarbeitskonten), which create specified
thresholds for individual employees beyond which overtime bonuses are provided. As German law prohibits
asking employees whether they are members of unions, we are not aware of how many of our employees are
unionized.

In general, our employees in Germany fall within the scope of the German Dismissal Protection Act
(Kündigungsschutzgesetz), which limits our ability to terminate individual employment relationships unilaterally.
In the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into a framework Social Plan (Rahmensozialplan) covering all
redundancies (betriebsbedingte Kündigungen) until December 31, 2021. We are also subject to the German AntiDiscrimination Act (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz) and comparable legislation in other countries in
which we operate.

We operate a number of company-sponsored supplementary long-term defined benefit pension
arrangements. These pension plans and individual pension commitments provide for the payment of old-age,
long-term disability and survivors’ benefits (spouses’ and orphans’ pensions). Subject to certain conditions, an
employee’s rights under those pension plans and individual pension commitments vest. In most cases, benefits
payable are determined on the basis of an employee’s length of service, earnings and position in our company.

In addition, employees in Germany may participate in defined contribution schemes (Direktversicherung or
_Pensionskasse), which are generally financed by employee contributions and partially supplemented by employer_
subsidies that are mainly financed by corresponding savings in employer contributions to the German social
security system.

**Insurance**

We carry an all-risk insurance policy for our assets, as well as policies for fire, explosion, radiation,
electrical damage, machinery breakdown, fuel or power shortages, third-party liability insurance, transport
insurance, computer insurance, directors’ and officers’ insurance and other assurance coverage, such as credit
insurance for receivables from customers, to the extent we believe necessary to operate our business. We believe
our policies are in accordance with customary industry practices, including deductibles and coverage amounts.
We regularly review our insurance program together with our insurance broker. We cannot guarantee, however,
that we will not incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies. In addition,
longer interruptions of business in one or more of our production facilities can, even if insured, result in loss of
sales, profit, customers and market share.

**Compliance**

We have in place policies, trainings (including online and in-person compliance internal trainings) and
controls to avoid irregularities in business activities or corruption, and any critical matters are discussed and
handled by our compliance committee. Additionally, we have a whistle blowing tool where reports on
irregularities or critical matters can be filed anonymously. In regards to sanctions, we block any sanctioned
countries in our Enterprise Resource Planning system to ensure that no order can be placed by or delivered to
sanctioned countries, such that no sales are made into sanctioned countries.

**Legal and Regulatory Proceedings**

We are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Except as stated below,
we are not and, have not been within the past twelve months, party to any material administrative, legal or
arbitration proceeding that may have or have had a significant effect on our financial position or profitability, and
we are not aware of any such proceedings being pending or threatened. We note, however, that the outcome of
legal proceedings can be extremely difficult to predict, and we offer no assurances in this regard.

W. Classen GmbH & Co. KG (“Classen”) has filed a case against us before the regional court of Düsseldorf
seeking damages of €55.0 million plus a significant amount of interest, for deliveries by us, of HDF panels to
three of its subsidiaries at excessive prices from 2002 to 2007. Classen filed the claim after an order from the
German Federal Cartel Office, which imposed financial penalties against a number of individuals and legal
entities, including us, for price collusion in the field of wood raw material products (“Chipboard Cartel”). As per
the court’s preliminary order passed on August 9, 2019, Classen’s claim is justified on the merits, but subject to
determination of the amount of damages. We have filed an appeal against the Düsseldorf regional court’s
decision before the Court of Appeal of Düsseldorf (Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf). On February 10, 2021, the
Court of Appeal largely confirmed the initial judgment on the merits, did not admit any further appeal to the
German Federal Court of Justice (“FCJ”) and ordered us to bear 85% of the legal costs for the appellate
proceedings (approximately €0.2 million). On March 17, 2021, we filed a complaint with the FCJ to dispute the
Court of Appeal’s denial of leave to appeal. The amount of damages payable to Classen remains unclear and
subject to separate proceedings on quantum which will be initiated only following a final and binding decision on
the merits. We have only made provisions for the costs in respect of these proceedings.

Oeseder Möbel-Industrie Mathias Wiemann GmbH & Co. KG (“Oeseder”), one of our Group’s customers,
filed a case against Sonae Arauco Deutschland AG (“Sonae”) before the regional court of Hannover, claiming
damages of €26.0 million plus a significant amount of interest. Sonae has claimed that it suffered damages due to
the Chipboard Cartel. The court has passed an order stating that Sonae’s claim is justified on the merits but
subject to determination of the amount of damages. Sonae has filed an appeal against the regional court’s
decision before the provincial High Court. We have been made a party to this case as an intervener
(Nebenintervenient) and its obligation could result from a contribution claim based on joint and several liability.
The appeal, as well as the proceedings for determination of damages, are currently pending and the next hearing
is scheduled for June 22, 2021. We have only made provisions for the costs and potential settlement of the claims
in respect of these proceedings.

**_Committees_**

The Advisory board of the Parent may form committees from among its members and charge them with the
performance of specific tasks. The committees’ tasks, authorizations and processes are determined by the
advisory board. Where permissible by law, important powers of the Advisory board may also be transferred to
the committees. The Advisory board of the Parent has established the following committees:

_Audit Committee_

The audit committee (Prüfungsausschuss) performs advisory and consultancy functions for the Parent’s
advisory board. The tasks and responsibilities of the audit committee include, among others, monitoring the
financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control, internal audit, risk management and internal
accounting control systems, including in the area of financial reporting, carrying out audit activities, and
controlling and monitoring the appointment and the independence of the statutory auditors. The audit committee
consists of at least two members, including a chairperson appointed by the advisory board.

_Nomination and Remuneration Committee_

The nomination and remuneration committee performs consulting and advisory functions for the Parent’s
Advisory board and supports the Advisory board in its performance of its statutory obligations. The tasks and
responsibilities of the nomination and remuneration committee include, among others, the monitoring of
succession plans and employee rotation processes and the assessment of employees’ satisfaction levels, the
assessment of candidates for the management board, the supervision of compensation policies as well as the
proposal of candidates for appointment to the advisory board. The audit committee consists of at least two
members appointed by the advisory board.

**Compensation, Other Benefits and Share Ownership**

Our remuneration system consists of a fixed salary and a performance-related bonus based on meeting
certain profitability and operational cash flow thresholds.

**_Service Agreements and Remuneration of the Members of the Management Board_**

Certain members of our Advisory Board and our Management Board, respectively, have entered into
customary service agreements with the Parent and the Issuer, respectively. The directors’ remuneration consists
of a fixed salary, a performance-related bonus based on meeting certain profitability and operational cash flow
thresholds, as well as a company car and contributions to a pension fund. We believe that each of the service
agreements appropriately reflects the level of responsibility of the relevant director and their contribution to
Pfleiderer’s long-term success.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, the remuneration paid to the members of the management board and
Advisory board of the Parent was initially recognized at the Parent level, since the management board is
employed by the Parent as well as its subsidiaries, including Pfleiderer and Panel East. The portion of these costs
economically attributable to Pfleiderer, which amounted to €2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020,
was determined using an allocation method based on the number of FTEs and subsequently charged to Pfleiderer.
For further details, see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_Management Investment Plan_**

Certain members of our senior management team, including our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief
Financial Officer, our Chief Operating Officer, our Chief Commercial Officer and the Chairperson of the
Parent’s advisory board, indirectly hold interests in an indirect parent entity of the Issuer which, under certain
circumstances, entitle them to receive a share of the proceeds from a future divestiture of the business.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

From time to time, we enter into transactions with our shareholders and other entities owned by, or affiliated
with, our direct and indirect shareholders in the ordinary course of business. These transactions include, among
other things, the sale of goods and services, including professional advisory, consulting and other corporate
services. For a description of our material, historical transactions with related parties, see the notes to our
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement**

On November 18, 2020, with retroactive effect from January 1, 2020, the Issuer and the Parent entered into
a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the “DPLTA”) pursuant to which the Issuer and its
consolidated subsidiaries located in Germany (other than Heller Holz GmbH) became part of the Parent’s tax
group for German corporate income and trade tax purposes. Pursuant to the DPLTA, the Parent is entitled to
issue binding directives to the Issuer in respect to all corporate matters of the Group. Furthermore, pursuant to the
DPLTA, the Issuer will be required to transfer its entire annual accounting profits and losses to the Parent. As a
result of the DPLTA, commencing with the year ending December 31, 2020, the taxable profits of the Issuer and
its subsidiaries that are part of the tax group are allocated to the Parent, which will be subject to German trade
taxes and potentially will fund German corporate income taxes at the level of the limited partners of the Parent.
We intend to comply with the Issuer’s obligations to transfer its profits to the Parents by way of (x) cash
payments to the Parents in respect of any German cash taxes to be paid by the Parent or funded by the Parent to
its limited partners as set out above and (y) an annual non-cash set-off of the amount of other transferable profits
of the Issuer against outstanding loan receivables due to the Issuer from the Parent, including the loan receivable
put in place in connection with the Transactions on the Issue Date. See “Use of Proceeds.” If the amount of
transferable profits of the Issuer exceeds the total outstanding amounts under the loan receivables due to the
Issuer from the Parent in the future, the Parent will convert such profits into a subordinated shareholder loan to
the Issuer. The DPLTA has an initial duration of six years (until December 31, 2025), after which it will
automatically renew for an indefinite period unless either party terminates the agreement by giving at least six
months’ notice.

**Panel East Resin Supply Agreement**

On November 17, 2020, with retroactive effect from January 1, 2020, Pfleiderer Grajewo, Pfleiderer MDF
Grajewo and Pfleiderer Wieruszów, as customers, and Silekol, as supplier, entered into the Panel East Resin
Supply Agreement pursuant to which each of the customers have agreed to purchase certain fixed quantities of
resin and other chemicals from Silekol each year, which constitute a significant portion of the purchasers’ annual
resin requirements.

The price for each order is determined on the basis of a price per ton of products calculated in accordance
with a formula that was contractually agreed at arm’s length and which takes into account, among other things,
prevailing raw material, labor and freight costs. The pricing formula may be updated with the agreement of all
parties for changes in the rate of inflation, labor and fuel costs. Prices are quoted on a delivered-at-place-basis in
euro and converted to Polish zloty at the average monthly euro to Polish zloty foreign exchange rate for the prior
month as published by the National Bank of Poland. Pursuant to the Panel East Resin Supply Agreement,
customers will receive a volume-based discount subject to meeting certain order thresholds. Payment for a resin
order is due within 60 days of the delivery of weekly invoices and Silekol is entitled to suspend the delivery of
resin if a customer fails to pay their invoice within 30 days after the due date.

The Panel East Resin Supply Agreement provides for customary liquidated damages if Silekol fails to fulfil
its orders on time, in which case customers are also permitted to source their resin requirements from third
parties and may require Silekol to reimburse them for any difference in the purchase price. Should a customer
fail to order the fixed contractually agreed quantity of resin from Silekol, Silekol is entitled to charge such
customer a penalty in an amount equal to (x) the unclaimed portion of the contractually agreed order volume
multiplied by (y) the price per ton of resin.

The Panel East Resin Supply Agreement contains a market standard force majeure clause and will terminate
on January 1, 2025. Prior to the expiration of its term, the Panel East Resin Supply Agreement may only be
terminated with respect to any customer who definitively and fully discontinues production activity relating to
particleboard and HDF boards. The Panel East Resin Supple Agreement is governed by Polish law.

-----

In the year ended December 31, 2020, sales of resins from our Silekol division to Panel East contributed
€6.8 million, or 39%, to the Adjusted EBITDA of our Silekol division.

**Wood Products Supply and Distribution Agreement**

Pfleiderer Deutschland GmbH and Pfleiderer Polska So. z o.o., as distributors, and certain of their respective
subsidiaries, as suppliers, have entered into a supply and distribution agreement (the “Wood Products Supply and
Distribution Agreement”) pursuant to which the distributors agree to distribute certain pre-agreed engineered
wood products supplied to them by the suppliers to external customers. The Wood Products Supply and
Distribution Agreement does not provide for minimum order quantities and the prices charged by the suppliers
for any products supplied is based on applicable standard market rates. Each distributor undertakes to support
and advertise the sale of the supplied products in its markets and with its customers and to regularly provide the
suppliers with updates relating to their products. We consider the Wood Products Supply and Distribution
Agreement to be on standard market terms. The Wood Products Supply and Distribution Agreement can be
terminated by any party for any reason by giving three months written notice and with immediate effect upon the
occurrence of certain significant events, including the Parent ceasing to own, directly or indirectly, at least a
majority of each of the parties to the agreement. As a result, the Wood Products Supply and Distribution
Agreement would become terminable upon a sale of Panel East. Based on our unaudited management accounts,
we estimate that the sale by our Engineered Wood Products division of products manufactured by Panel East
under a Wood Supply and Distribution Agreement, contributed approximately €2.2 million, or 1.9%, to the
Adjusted EBITDA of our Engineered Wood Products division in the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition,
based on our unaudited management accounts, we estimate the sale by Panel East of products manufactured by
our Engineered Wood Products division contributed approximately €2.2 million, or 1.9%, to the Adjusted
EBITDA of our Engineered Wood Products division in the year ended December 31, 2020.

**Joint Procurement**

Historically, our Engineered Wood Products and Silekol divisions and Panel East have jointly purchased
selected categories of raw materials, such as paper and chemicals, which has allowed us to benefit from certain
procurement cost synergies due to the larger scale purchasing power of the three divisions compared to our
Group. Following a sale of Panel East, we may no longer be able to benefit from such procurement cost
synergies.

**Ordinary Course of Business Relationships with Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies**

In the course of our ordinary business activities, we regularly enter into intercompany loan, intercompany
receivables, purchase and supply agreements between subsidiaries and affiliated companies and with associated
companies or shareholders of such associated companies, including holders of non-controlling interests that are
not part of our Group.

In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Issuer provides certain services to Panel East, including
technical engineering services, information technology services and miscellaneous other corporate services, such
as accounting, tax, legal and treasury services. We provide these services to Panel East on standard market terms.
In the event of a sale of Panel East to a third party, we may enter into a transition services agreement with the
new owner of Panel East for the provision of certain services, including information technology, selected
technical support services and miscellaneous other corporate services.

The Issuer, the Parent and certain Group companies are also party to certain cash pooling agreements. For
more information, please see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Cash Pooling Agreements.”

**Parent Loan**

In connection with the Silekol Transfer, the Parent transferred all of the shares in Silekol sp.z o.o. to the
Issuer in partial repayment of a loan owed to the the Issuer (the “Parent Loan”). As of December 31, 2020,
€31.5 million remains outstanding under the Parent Loan. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Position and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—The Optimization_
_of Our Corporate Structure—The Silekol Transfer.”_

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following is a summary of the material terms of our principal financing arrangements in addition to the_
_Indenture after giving effect to the Transactions. The following summaries do not purport to describe all of the_
_applicable terms and conditions of such arrangements and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the_
_actual agreements. Capitalized terms used in the following summaries and not otherwise defined in this offering_
_memorandum have the meanings ascribed to them in their respective agreements._

**New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

In connection with the Transactions, the Issuer will enter into a new super senior revolving credit facility
agreement with, among others, the Parent as Topco, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as the Security Agent,
the facility agent named therein as Agent, and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe S.E., Credit Suisse (Deutschland)
Aktiengesellschaft, Bank of America Europe Designated Activity Company, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft
and Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft as mandated lead arrangers (the “New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement”). The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for a new super senior revolving credit
facility in a principal amount of €65.0 million (the “New Revolving Credit Facility” for the purposes of this
description).

The New Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by the Issuer, Pfleiderer Deutschland GmbH and Silekol
s.p. z.o.o. and certain of its restricted subsidiaries which accede to the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
as additional borrowers of that facility (the “SSRCF Borrowers”) and may be applied in or towards (directly or
indirectly): (A) financing or refinancing the general corporate purposes and/or working capital requirements of
the Group (including, without limitation, the financing or refinancing of capital expenditure, any permitted
acquisition, investments and joint ventures, operational restructurings and reorganization requirements of the
Group, financing or refinancing financial indebtedness of the Group (including the refinancing or discharge of
the existing indebtedness of certain members of the Group) or any acquisition target and paying any related
breakage costs, redemption premium, make-whole costs and other fees, costs and expenses payable in connection
with such refinancing or discharge, any required original issue discount fees or any additional original issue
discount fees or funding any market flex or any ticking fees required to be paid in connection with and any
interest accruing on indebtedness); and/or (B) any other purpose contemplated by a funds flow statement relating
to the Transactions or a tax structure memorandum relating to the Transactions.

The New Revolving Credit Facility will be available in euros, sterling, U.S. dollars and certain other
currencies readily available in the relevant interbank market by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of letters
of credit and ancillary facilities (on a bilateral and fronted basis).

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes (in addition to other permissions under the
limitation on indebtedness covenant) the ability (without double counting against the limitation on indebtedness
covenant) to incur additional indebtedness (including under one or more uncommitted additional facilities within
the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or any additional notes and/or other facilities or notes
documented outside the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) up to (after taking into account the
commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility) an aggregate amount of the greater of €105 million and
69% of LTM EBITDA (as defined in “Description of the Notes”).

**_Availability_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from (and including) the issue date of the Notes (the
“Closing Date”) to (and including) the date which is one month prior to the maturity date of the New Revolving
Credit Facility.

**_Conditions Precedent_**

Utilizations of the New Revolving Credit Facility are subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to
EURIBOR or, for loans denominated other than in Euro, LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, which in each case
will be subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to
consolidated pro forma EBITDA (the “Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio”).

155


-----

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under the
New Revolving Credit Facility. If LIBOR is less than zero, LIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans
made under the New Revolving Credit Facility.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the New
Revolving Credit Facility from the Closing Date to the end of the availability period applicable to the New
Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 30% of the applicable margin for the New Revolving Credit Facility.
Commitment fees will be payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of the availability period and on the date
the New Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full or on the date on which the relevant lender cancels its
commitment.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

**_Repayments_**

The loans made under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the last day of the interest period
relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll over cash drawings. All outstanding amounts under the New
Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the date falling fifty-four (54) months from the Closing Date.
Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the New Revolving Credit Facility may be reborrowed,
subject to certain conditions.

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to de minimis
amounts). The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory
prepayment of all amounts due to that lender upon a “Change of Control.”

A “Change of Control” for the purposes of the New Revolving Credit Facility shall be defined as per the
Notes, including a change of control with respect to Topco ceasing to own 100% of the shares in the Issuer, but
the proviso to the definition of “Change of Control Triggering Event” shall not apply.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by each Guarantor on a joint and several basis.

The New Revolving Credit Facility will be secured by the same security interests as for the Notes as set
forth under “Description of the Notes—Security.”

Subject to certain adjustments and the agreed security principles that apply to the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the Issuer is required to ensure that members of the Group that generate at least 80% of
Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the section entitled “Description of the Notes”) are guarantors of the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (i) on the date which is 120 days following the Closing Date; and
(ii) thereafter on the date when the annual financial statements of the Issuer are required to be delivered to the
agent in connection with the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject to
certain limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the other
matters set forth in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (and, to the extent such requirement at
(ii) above is not satisfied on such date, the Issuer shall ensure that it is so satisfied within 120 days of such date).

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain representations and warranties (subject to
certain agreed qualifications and with certain representations being repeated), including: (i) status, binding
obligations, non-conflict with other obligations, power and authority, validity and admissibility in evidence,
governing law and enforcement and pari passu ranking; (ii) no insolvency, no litigation and taxation; (iii) no
default, financial statements and no misleading information; (iv) no liens/indebtedness; (v) ownership and
environmental laws; (vi) intellectual property; and (vii) centre of main interests and compliance with sanctions
and anti-corruption laws.

Certain representations and warranties will be made on the Closing Date and will be repeated on the date of
each utilization, on the first day of each interest period (other than in the case of roll over cash drawings) and at
certain other times.

**_Covenants_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and related
definitions (with certain adjustments and exceptions) that are set forth in the Indenture.

156


-----

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains a “note purchase condition” covenant. Subject
to certain exceptions set out in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Issuer may not, and shall
procure that no restricted subsidiary will, repay, prepay, purchase, defease, redeem or otherwise retire any Notes
(or additional Notes issued under the Indenture (or offer to do so) prior to their scheduled repayment date). The
exceptions to such covenant include (among other things) notes purchases that do not exceed 50% of the
aggregate original principal amount of the Notes as at the Closing Date.

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires the Issuer and certain of its restricted
subsidiaries to observe certain other customary positive and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions and
grace periods, including covenants relating to: (i) authorizations and consents; (ii) compliance with laws;
(iii) centre of main interests; (iv) provision of guarantees and security and further assurance; and (v) compliance
with sanctions, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption laws.

In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes a financial covenant requiring the drawn
super senior leverage ratio not to exceed a ratio to be set with 40 per cent headroom versus the base case model
for the New Revolving Credit Facility (which shall be calculated by reducing Consolidated EBITDA as set out in
that base case model and assuming full utilisation of the New Revolving Credit Facility and no cash on the
balance sheet (the “Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio”)). The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio is
calculated as the ratio of consolidated drawn loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility and any other funded
indebtedness that ranks pari passu with such loans in respect of the distribution of Recoveries (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) net of cash and cash equivalents (the “Drawn Super Senior Facilities Debt”) to
Consolidated pro forma EBITDA for the twelve month period preceding the relevant quarterly testing date, and
is tested quarterly on a rolling basis, subject to the aggregate outstanding amount of all Loans outstanding under
the New Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any utilizations drawn on the Closing Date, any utilizations by way
of letters of credit (or bank guarantees), ancillary facilities, or any amounts used to fund any original issue
discount paid on or around the date of the Closing Date and any other flex-related payments, fees and expenses)
net of cash and cash equivalents exceeding 40% of the total commitments of the New Revolving Credit Facility
on the relevant test date (the “Test Condition”). The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio, if breached, will
trigger a drawstop on any further borrowing under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement unless the
breach is cured or remedied.

The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio is based on the definitions and adjustments in the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in the Indenture and the equivalent
definitions described in this offering memorandum.

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the shareholders
of the Issuer to make shareholder injections by way of debt and/or equity to the Issuer to (i) increase the
consolidated pro forma EBITDA under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, (ii) decrease Drawn Super
Senior Facilities Debt, or (iii) prepay the New Revolving Credit Facility so that the Test Condition is no longer
satisfied. The equity cure rights pursuant to (i) and (ii) above may not be exercised on more than five occasions
during the term of the New Revolving Credit Facility and may not be exercised more than twice in any
consecutive four quarter periods.

It is intended that certain agreed covenants and other provisions of the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement will fall-away on the satisfaction of certain release conditions, being (i) the occurrence of a listing
which does not constitute a change of control and in respect of which the Group’s senior secured net leverage
ratio does not exceed an agreed ratio; or (ii) the Issuer having a long-term corporate credit rating equal to or
better than Baa3 according to Moody’s Investor Services Limited or BBB- according to Standard & Poor’s
Rating Services.

**_Events of Default_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default as
under the Notes. In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for additional events of
default, subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including (i) inaccuracy of a
representation or statement when made; (ii) repudiation, rescission, invalidity and unlawfulness of the New
Revolving Credit Facility financing documents; and (iii) material failure to comply with the Intercreditor
Agreement.

157


-----

**_Governing Law_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with
English law although the information undertakings, restrictive covenants, events of default and related definitions
scheduled to the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with New York law
(without prejudice to the fact that the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Issuer,
certain Guarantors and the Trustee will enter into the Intercreditor Agreement between, among others, the agent,
arrangers and lenders under our New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Security Agent. We expect
the Trustee to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement on or about the Issue Date.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the
relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the Issuer, the
Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider, when payments can be made in respect of debt of the Debtors or Third Party Security
Providers, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to which certain of
that debt will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover provisions and
provisions related to the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It
does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it, and
not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes and of the Trustee. Capitalized
terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement.

For the purposes of this description:

“Senior Secured Group” shall mean the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

other debt instruments issued or to be issued by or in relation to which a New Debt Financing has been made
available to or by a Topco Borrower which are designated by the Issuer as Topco Notes.

Security or Topco Shared Security or as described above) shall be granted by a member of the Senior
Secured Group in respect of any Topco Liabilities.

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements that will constitute, for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities,
Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities or Hedging Liabilities
(each a “New Debt Financing”). The conditions include certification by the Issuer that such New Debt Financing
is not prohibited under the terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, set-off,
discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental financing arrangement under the
relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New Debt Financing, each agent in
respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent (and each other person party to a Transaction
Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document) is authorized and instructed to enter
promptly into any new security document, amend or waive any term of an existing security document and/or
release any asset from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be)
and/or to effect the ranking, priority guarantees and security of the New Debt Financing subject to certain
conditions, including as regards the terms of any such new security in relation to such New Debt Financing
(which shall be, unless otherwise agreed by the Issuer or otherwise required by the Issuer to the extent that the
existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is not being amended or released and
the new Transaction Security or new Topco Independent Transaction Security only secures the New Debt
Financing, substantially the same as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited under the Finance
Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its subsidiaries who, after
the Closing Date, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges, consolidates or is otherwise combined with a
Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of any such person or which is otherwise acquired after the
Closing Date (together an “Acquired Person or Asset”), any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance
against loss in respect of such New Debt Financing which is subsisting at the date when the conditions to the
incurrence of such New Debt Financing set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be
granted thereafter, including subject to any condition or periodic testing) shall be permitted to subsist and there is
no requirement to offer that security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in respect of any other liabilities
under any Debt Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is required to be
given by any member of the Topco Group in respect of any liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i)
over any Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group
or is excluded or exempt from being given under the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), (ii) over any asset required (including subject to any condition) to provide
credit support in relation to any Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other than as a result of any obligation to
extend any Transaction Security rateably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness), or (iii) where
the grant of such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is prevented by the documentation
in relation to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would give rise to an obligation (including any payment
obligation but not including any obligation to extend any Transaction Security rateably for the benefit of such
Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

Facility Liabilities (together with the Hedging Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities,” the creditors
in respect thereof being the “Senior Secured Creditors”) at any time, provided that following certain acceleration
events under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement or Senior Secured Notes Indenture or Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or
following an Insolvency Event (defined below), payments may only be made by Issuer, the members of the
Group or Third Party Security Providers and received by creditors in accordance with the provisions described
below under “Application of Proceeds” provided that there shall be no obligation to turnover any such payments
received, other than those related to an enforcement of Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined
below) of assets subject to the Transaction Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following an
acceleration event as required by the ICA shall not prevent the occurrence of an event of default under such
applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities (together, the “Senior Secured Liabilities” and together with the Second Lien
Liabilities and Topco Liabilities being the “Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged (the “Senior Secured
Discharge Date”), the Issuer, the members of the Group and Third Party Security Providers may only make
specified scheduled payments in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, in accordance with the finance documents
governing such Second Lien Liabilities, subject to compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized interest)
is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior Secured

the Intercreditor Agreement), no payment stop notice has been issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant
Second Lien Liabilities and no Senior Secured Payment Default (as defined below) has occurred and is
continuing.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times,
notwithstanding that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These
payments and basket amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities in (ii) of the next
paragraph.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date (the “Second Lien
Discharge Date”) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the “Priority Discharge Date”), the

under the Second Lien Facilities or Second Lien Notes (a “Second Lien Payment Default”); and

(C) the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the Topco

acceleration event, (2) any other amount which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest
(such other amounts including all scheduled interest payments (including, if applicable, special
interest (or liquidated damages) the accrual of cash interest otherwise payable during a period
when a Topco Payment Stop Notice is outstanding and default interest on the Topco Liabilities

additional amounts payable as a result of the tax gross-up provisions relating to Topco Liabilities
and amounts in respect of currency indemnities in any Topco Finance Document, (3) made in
pursuance of a debt buy-back program approved by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,
Majority Super Senior Creditors and Majority Second Lien Creditors (each as defined below), or
(4) amounts due under any syndication strategy letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents;

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or (other
than in respect of paragraph (N) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default and/or a Second Lien
Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a guarantor or borrower
under any prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect of paragraph (L) below)
irrespective of whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities have accelerated their debt, the
payment is not prohibited to be made at such time by any prior ranking financing agreements (in
respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or the payment is (without
double counting any equivalent applicable basket in any Debt Document, but whether or not permitted
by the Debt Documents): (A) of ongoing fees under any original fee letter relating to the Topco
Finance Documents, (B) of commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for restructuring
advice and valuations (including legal advice and the advice of other appropriate financial and/or

Topco Finance Documents), (F) of any other amount not exceeding €5,000,000 in any financial year of
the Issuer, provided that any such amount not so applied may be carried forward and utilized in the
subsequent financial year (where it shall be deemed to have been used first), (G) of any amount of the
Topco Liabilities which would have been payable but for the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice
(which has since expired and no new Topco Payment Stop Notice is outstanding) which has been
capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Topco Liabilities or where that amount is
outstanding as a result of the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the Topco Liabilities during
such period or any such amount described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such payment may be made
if certain events of default have occurred under the Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien
Liabilities or would occur as a result of making such payment, (H) for as long as an event of default
under the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Group Liabilities documents
which is continuing, all or part of the Topco Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged solely in
consideration for the issues of shares in any holding company of the Issuer (a “Debt for Equity Swap”)
provided that no cash or cash equivalent payment is made in respect of the Topco Liabilities, that it
does not result in a Change of Control as defined in any prior ranking finance agreement or Topco
Finance Document and that any Liabilities owed by a member of the Senior Secured Group to another
member of the Senior Secured Group, to the Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding company
of the Issuer that arise as a result of any such Debt for Equity Swap are subordinated to the Senior
Secured Liabilities and Second Lien Liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior
Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors are granted Transaction Security in respect of any of

instrument which is subordinated on the same terms as the Topco Liabilities, (J) of audit fees,
directors’ fees, taxes and other proper and incidental expenses required to maintain existence or any

-----

other reasonable and ordinary course administrative and maintenance costs and expenses of a Topco
Borrower or an Affiliate thereof, (K) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds
of Topco Liabilities incurred under or pursuant to any Topco Finance Documents, (L) if the payment is

such payment is not directly or indirectly sourced from a member of the Senior Secured Group or such
payment is funded from proceeds received by the Topco Borrower from the Senior Secured Group
without breaching the terms of the Debt Documents, (M) if the payment is of a principal amount of the
Topco Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision in a Topco Finance Document relating to
prepayment upon illegality or any other provision that permits the repayment in full of the participation
of any Topco Creditor (without a related requirement to repay all other Topco Creditors), including a
provision (if any) in a Topco Finance Document which is substantially equivalent to the prepayment of
a single lender in the event of a tax gross-up, increased costs or other indemnity becoming payable and
(N) if no Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is
continuing the payment is a payment of principal, interest or any other amounts made on or after the
final maturity date of the relevant Topco Liabilities (provided that such maturity date is no earlier than
that contained in the original form of the relevant Topco Finance Document as of the date of first
issuance or borrowing (as the case may be) of the applicable Topco Liabilities; or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give prior
consent to that payment being made.

A reference in the section above to a payment shall be construed to include any other direct or indirect step,
matter, action or dealing in relation to any Topco Liabilities which are otherwise prohibited under the
Intercreditor Agreement.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party Security
Providers may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco Finance
Documents and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date falling one Business Day
after the date on which, following the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a
“Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien
Event of Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Super Senior Creditors, Senior
Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) (a
“Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any Topco Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under
any Topco Notes (the “Topco Notes Trustee”) advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien
Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities,
until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the
relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has
been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Second Lien Creditors gave the
instructions for the relevant Topco Payment Stop Notice to be delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco
Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco Notes Trustee cancelling the Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured
Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the relevant event

165


-----

of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event or set
of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of a
Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a
payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect
of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco
Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability to
make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable Debt
Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and capitalization of
interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a
payment stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party that has
acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the “Topco
Investors”) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments
which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as
applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop
Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

(iii) then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco
Proceeds Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result
of that suspension of payments shall be waived without any further action being required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions (including, but not limited to, a provision that provides that any Intra-Group
Lender in respect of Intra-Group Liabilities who is under a competing contractual requirement to turnover those
proceeds to any trade creditor of the Topco Group (and that competing obligations is not prohibited by a Finance
Document) is not required to turnover the applicable proceeds), the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if,
at any time prior to the latest to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date (as defined below), the Senior Secured
Discharge Date, the Second Lien Discharge Date and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have
been fully discharged (the “Topco Discharge Date”) (the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a
Senior Secured Creditor) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third
Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out
below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction
Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other litigation or
proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any Third Party Security
Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event); or

166


-----

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out below
under “Application of Proceeds”;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities
owed by any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider which
is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and which is
made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that Debtor, member
of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,

That creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of
that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on
trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and promptly pay or
distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any) by
which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time prior to the
Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from any Debtor, any member of the
Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the enforcement of security or
from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event or the enforcement of security,
any proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other amounts which should otherwise be
received or recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance with the provisions set out below under
“—Application of Proceeds.”

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Obligor, Material Subsidiary (being each original obligor
under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and, subject to certain adjustments and the agreed security
principles that apply to the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, each member of the Group that has an
EBITDA representing 5% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the
passing of any resolution or making of an order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution,
administration, examination or reorganization, (b) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its indebtedness,
(c) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other
similar officer in respect of it or any of its assets, or (d) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any
jurisdiction, other than (in each case), (i) frivolous or vexatious proceedings, (ii) proceedings or appointments
which the Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or (iii) as permitted under any Senior
Secured Credit Facility Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a
default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled to
receive a distribution out of the assets of an Obligor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider (in the
case of a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall
direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities
owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to
it in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities to
creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a

167


-----

Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an amount equal to the
amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that
the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event, each creditor irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement
Action (as defined below), make demands, collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions
necessary to make recovery in relation to the Debtors, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party
Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give
effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the
Transaction Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent of an
Instructing Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable) otherwise as
specified in the provisions described below.

An “Instructing Group” means:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super Senior
Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”), Senior Secured
Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50% of the credit
participations of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority
Senior Secured Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors representing more than 50% of the credit
participations of the Super Senior Secured Liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that,
for instructions relating to enforcement, it shall mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give
instructions in accordance with the enforcement regime described under “—Enforcement of
_Transaction Security” below;_

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date but
before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than 50% of the credit
participations of the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than 50% of the credit participations of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco
Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise in
accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security has become enforceable,
if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement
instructions their respective representatives (and, if applicable, the hedge counterparties) shall deliver a copy of
those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and
hedge counterparties which did not deliver such Initial Enforcement Notice.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to
instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior
Discharge has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an
Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is
continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct

168


-----

the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors (x) determine in good faith that a delay
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the
Transaction Security or on the realization of proceeds and (y) deliver instructions they reasonably believe is
consistent with the Enforcement Principles (as defined below) before the Security Agent has received any
instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super
Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super
Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as
applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or cease
enforcing and have not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the
Majority Second Lien Creditors, where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the
Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given
instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or cease enforcing and have not required
any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Majority Topco Creditors who
are then entitled to give such instructions under the Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions either give such instruction or
indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Super
Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement instructions as described in the
paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they see fit
and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that (i) to
the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement chosen
should maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received in cash, and
(iii) enforcement in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or shares if not carried out by way of a public auction or
other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is request to do so by the Majority Super Senior
Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of
accountants or third party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its
terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco
Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance with
any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any
administrator of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any
persons entitled at any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such
instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the
Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with the paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Certain of the features set out below with respect to Topco Creditors may apply to the Second Lien
Creditors, with appropriate modifications for the relative position in the capital structure.

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors” will not apply in
respect of the Topco Group Liabilities, Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities, or any Transaction Security securing the
Topco Group Liabilities, if:

(i) an event of default (the “Topco Event of Default”) under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco
Proceeds Loan Agreement (the “Relevant Topco Default”) is continuing;

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, and
Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Topco Default from the Topco Agent, the Topco Notes Trustee
or the Topco Borrower in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities;

(iii) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Topco Default is continuing at the end of that Topco Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Topco Event of Default, a Topco Notes Trustee, Topco Agent or Topco
Investor (as the case may be) may give a Topco Enforcement Notice notifying any agent under a Permitted
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the “Senior Agent”), senior secured notes trustee, the Second Lien Agent
and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of such event of default.

“Topco Standstill Period” means the period beginning on the date (the “Topco Standstill Start Date”) a
Topco Enforcement Notice is served in respect of such a Relevant Topco Default and ending on the earliest to
occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Topco Standstill Start Date (the “Topco Standstill Period”);

(ii) the date the Priority Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider, provided that:

(A) if a Topco Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (ii), the Topco Creditors or a Topco
Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may only take the same
Enforcement Action in relation to a Topco Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the
Priority Secured Parties against such Topco Guarantor and not against any other member of the
Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken to preserve or
protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event (as defined above) in relation to a particular Topco Guarantor against
whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(iv) the expiry of any other Topco Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned Topco
Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or other permitted
remedy); and

(v) the first date on which each of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors and the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have given their consent to the
relevant Enforcement Action.

The Topco Creditors or Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may take
Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco Enforcement) in relation to a
Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at any later time, a further
Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other event of default in respect of the Topco Liabilities.

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior
Secured Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may elect, by giving

171


-----

not less than 10 days’ prior written notice to the Security Agent, to purchase all, but not part of, the Senior
Lender Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility
Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have
been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors
must also elect for the counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in
exchange (subject to specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such hedging
obligations had they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such
purchase.

**_Non-Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that it shall (and is
irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement or instruction from
any creditor, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written request from the Issuer:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security and the Secured Debt Documents:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the Issuer has
confirmed is the subject of:

(1) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable release and/
or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document including a disposal to
a member of the Senior Secured Group but without prejudice to any obligation of any
member of the Senior Secured Group in a Finance Document to provide replacement
security;

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents pursuant to which that asset
will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Senior Secured Group (or, to the extent
any applicable Finance Document prohibits such transaction, the applicable Agent authorizes
the release in accordance with the terms of the applicable Finance Document or the Required
Creditor Consent for such transaction has been obtained),

in each case where such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) (in each case, a
“Non-Distressed Disposal”);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the Senior Secured Group to effect any
amendment or waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligation or take any
action in relation to such document or agreement to the extent that the Issuer has confirmed that
such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document;

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of the
Senior Secured Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor to the extent that
the Issuer has confirmed that such ceasing to be a Debtor or guarantor in accordance with the
terms of each Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement); and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the extent
that the Issuer has confirmed that such security is not required to be given or such release in
accordance with the terms of any Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined
in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement); and

(ii) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interest in a Debtor, other member of the Senior Secured
Group or any holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor,
other member of the Senior Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a
member of the Topco Group or a Debtor, release or procure the release of that Debtor or other member
of the Senior Secured Group and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the
Secured Debt Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents
(including any claim relating to a Debt Document).

172


-----

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A), (i)(B) or (ii) above, the Issuer shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited as at the date
of completion of such release or, at the option of the Issuer, on the date that the definitive agreement for such
disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Issuer shall confirm
in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant release or cessation
is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed Security Principles (as
defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured
Group or holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of the
Senior Secured Group or holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco Group or a Debtor,
to the extent the Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that it is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if
such member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document,
such person shall have the right to voluntarily prepay all Liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a
member of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any assets or shares or
financial securities which are subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected (a) at the request of an
Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an
acceleration event, (b) by enforcement of the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event, or (c) after
the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of security as a result of an acceleration event, by a
Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the
cost of the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and the Issuer and without any consent, sanction,
authority or further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security
Provider or Debtor):

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release of that
Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any
consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that Debtor
and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities;
(B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its
assets, and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or
another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf
of the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to
release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted by that holding company
or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and (C) any other claim of an intragroup lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a Debtor over that holding company’s assets
or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to
dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or any of their
subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that
any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to
dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any
Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that
any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement,

173


-----

to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of the
liabilities owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of any other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors; and

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the
Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of
the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities to any
Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are
owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities)
to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities,
liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the
obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be
transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as described
above in (iv)) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under
“—Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction
Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred pursuant to (iv) and (v) above, as if that
disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to (iv) and (v) above) effected by, or
at the request of, the Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in
the prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such
Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price), and shall in all cases comply with
the requirements set out in the paragraphs below (as applicable) and act in accordance with them (as applicable).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to
give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee
liabilities or other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee
liabilities or other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the
case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility,
made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) immediately
following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give,
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized
to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities or
other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing
liabilities or guarantee liabilities or other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien
Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit,
cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to
the relevant senior creditor) immediately following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities, guarantee
liabilities or other liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Issuer specified by such creditor, in which
case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any
consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as
are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other liabilities.

Subject to the paragraphs below, if a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to paragraphs
(iv) and (v) above) is being effected by or at the request of the Security Agent, unless the consent of each Senior

174


-----

Agent and each Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable) has been obtained, it is a further condition to any
release, transfer or disposal under paragraphs (i) to (v) above that:

(i) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(A) pursuant to a competitive sales process; or

(B) where a reputable, independent and internationally recognized investment bank, firm of
accountants or third party financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an
opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the Group which can be relied upon by the Security
Agent and disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco
Creditors on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds received or recovered in connection with such
sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances including the method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security
Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any investment bank, firm of accountants or
third party financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded
to its satisfaction).

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of Liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Second Lien Liabilities and/or Transaction Security
securing Second Lien Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, it is a further condition to any release, transfer, or disposal under paragraphs (i) to (v) above that
either:

(i) the Second Lien Agent and each Second Lien Notes Trustee have approved the release, transfer or

and in each case all Transaction Security, Topco Independent Transaction Security or other
security in favor of the Secured Parties in respect of the assets of such members of the Group is

nevertheless less than the aggregate amount of outstanding amount of the liabilities owed to
the Priority Secured Parties (which shall be deemed to be the case if there are no bidders or if
each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee (acting reasonably and in good faith)
determines that there are no bona fide and fully committed bids in cash or substantially all in
cash in excess of the outstanding amount of the liabilities owed to the Priority Secured
Parties) (the “Priority Secured Liabilities”); and

(E) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor.

_Order of Application—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to certain provisions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement, all amounts from time to time received
or recovered by the Security Agent pursuant to the terms of any Topco Document in connection with the
realization or enforcement of Topco Independent Transaction Security or any guarantees provided by a Topco
Guarantor (other than a member of the Senior Secured Group) (the “Topco Recoveries”) shall be applied at any
time as the Security Agent sees fit, in the following order of priority:

(i) in discharging any Agent Liabilities in respect of the Topco Liabilities (to the extent related to such
Topco Recoveries), the Security Agent and any receiver or delegate, on a pari passu basis;

(ii) in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by any agent or Topco Creditor in connection with any
realization or enforcement of the Topco Independent Transaction Security taken in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) for application towards the discharge of:

(A) the Topco Facility Liabilities; and

(B) the Topco Notes Liabilities,

on a pro rata basis and ranking pari passu between paragraphs (A) and (B) above;

(iv) if none of the Debtors or Third Party Security Providers or Topco Independent Obligors is under any
further actual or contingent liability in respect of the Secured Liabilities, in payment to any other
person whom the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to any Debtor or Third Party Security
Provider or Topco Independent Obligor; and

(v) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor.

**_Equalization_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the first
date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses
are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their respective exposures at
the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that specified class at the
Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst themselves as the Security
Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments)
those losses are borne in those proportions.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or
waived only with the consent of the Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the Security
Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and
such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the
interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the agent or trustee acting on behalf of the
affected class shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to,
among other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above and the order of priority or
subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of each of the agents or

178


-----

trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior
Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities, (i) each Cash Management Facility Lender
(only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and
obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), (iii) each Hedge
Counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the
rights and obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), and (iv) the Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions or
authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized to relate to
any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below) or as permitted by the
Debt Documents, (i) the Security Agent may, if the Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of
the requirements of or grant consents under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security which shall be binding on each party, (ii) the Security Agent may, if the Issuer consents,
amend, release and/or retake any Transaction Security Document where such amendment, release and/or retake is
required in order to ensure the validity, perfection or priority of the Transaction Security purported to be created
under such Transaction Security Document, together with any related or consequential waiver (including by
reason of a failure to register such Transaction Security Document with Companies House within the prescribed
time limit set out in section 859 of the Companies Act 2006, in which case the Security Agent shall also
irrevocably waive any payment or other obligation or default arising out of such failure to register) and any such
amendment, release, waiver and retake shall be binding on each party (iii) and the prior consent of the Secured
Parties is required to authorize any amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any document creating
Transaction Security which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets subject to Transaction
Security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security are distributed.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations
which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including, without
limitation, any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may not
be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “—Amendments and Waivers: Transaction
_Security Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular to_
(i) any release of Transaction Security, claim or liabilities, or (ii) to any amendment waiver or consent, which, in
each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to
the incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under “—New Debt Financings,”
“Non-Distressed Disposals” and “—Distressed Disposals” above. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent
effected in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be
effected solely by the Issuer and the Security Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any action
or to provide any confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement or another
applicable agreement (but excluding any indenture), any creditor fails to respond to the request within ten
Business Days (or any other period of time notified by the Issuer, with the agreement of each of the agents or
trustee in the case of a shorter period of time) or fails to provide details of its credit participation, such creditor
will be disregarded or be deemed to have zero participation in respect of the matter or be deemed to have
provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as applicable.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

Following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an “IPO”), the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically

179


-----

operate so that, amongst other things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to
the member of the Senior Secured Group or holding company of the Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares
are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Pushdown Entity,” and if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in
full on or before the date of such IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be the Topco Borrower) and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made excluding any holding company of the IPO
Pushdown Entity, (iii) certain provisions of the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings and
events of default) will cease to apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity.

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations under the Debt
Documents (including any Transaction Security) and each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security Provider,
Investor (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor will be
released from its obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities,
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and
as defined in any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of any Second Lien
Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility and noteholders representing
more than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant IPO), the Issuer and each subsidiary of the
IPO Pushdown Entity shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor under the Debt
Documents and from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (other than, in each
case, borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any
amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate such matters.

_Agreement to Override_

To the extent any step or action is permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement (or permitted subject to the
consent of specified parties under the Intercreditor Agreement), the parties agree that such step or action will be
permitted under the other Debt Documents (or permitted thereunder subject to the consent of such specified
parties) and if there is any conflict between the terms of, or the requirement for any conditions in, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any other Debt Document, the terms of, or the requirement for any conditions in, the
Intercreditor Agreement will prevail (save to the extent that to do so would result in or have the effect of any
member of the Group contravening any applicable law or regulation, or present a material risk of liability for any
member of the Group and/or its directors or officers, or give rise to a material risk of breach of fiduciary or
statutory duties), in each case notwithstanding any restriction or prohibition to the contrary, any provision
expressed or purported to override any provision of the Intercreditor Agreement or the requirement to fulfil any
additional conditions, in each case, in any other Debt Document.

**Cash Pooling Agreements**

For the purposes of improved cash management, certain German companies of Pfleiderer (Pfleiderer
Deutschland GmbH, Pfleiderer Arnsberg GmbH, Pfleiderer Neumarket GmbH, Pfleiderer Leutkirch GmbH,
Heller Holz GmbH, JURA-Spedition GmbH, Pfleiderer Gütersloh GmbH and Pfleiderer Baruth GmbH) have
implemented a central cash pooling (zero-balancing) system operated with Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. An
account of Pfleiderer Deutschland GmbH serves as a central pooling account (Zielkonto). The balances resulting
from the daily settlement of accounts are subject to customary interest rates. The general policy on cash balances
regarding the accounts of the participating companies is to transfer these to central pooling account as well as
settle the balances on the respective accounts by way of crediting the central pooling account. This takes place
daily. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Parent is a party to these cash pooling arrangements to
cover any corporate and other expenses incurred by it as the shareholder of the Group.

**Securitization and Factoring Arrangements**

**_Securitization Program_**

Pfleiderer Deutschland GmbH, Pfleiderer Arnsberg GmbH, Pfleiderer Neumarkt GmbH, Pfleiderer
Leutkirch GmbH, Heller Holz GmbH, JURA-Spedition GmbH, Pfleiderer Gütersloh GmbH and Pfleiderer
Baruth GmbH are party to a securitization program arranged by Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft through assetbacked commercial paper and medium-term note programs with Silvertower, initially dated as of October 15,
2012, and amended from time to time. Commencing on January 1, 2021, the securitization program provides for
a financing volume of up to €60 million.

180


-----

Under the securitization program, trade receivables are sold by the relevant companies in our group, as
sellers and servicers, to Silvertower on a weekly basis. Subject to certain servicing termination events, each seller
is obligated to continue to service the sold receivables on behalf of Silvertower and any cash receipts are placed
in the relevant company’s special collection account, which is pledged to Silvertower. Cash collections and
payments for sold receivables are settled on a net basis once per week.

The purchase of receivables by Silvertower is made without the recourse to the respective sellers (with the
exception of certain purchase price reductions retained to minimize risk for the buyer of our receivables). The
sellers are obligated (joint and several liability) to indemnify the purchaser for any damages suffered as a result
of a breach of customary representations, warranties and covenants. The sellers are obligated to pay to the
purchaser certain customary fees in connection with the program, reimburse refinancing costs and pay foreign
currency exchange fees with respect to receivables denominated in a currency other than euro.

**_Factoring Facility_**

Silekol sp.z o.o. is party to a factoring facility agreement with Bank Millennium S.A., as factor, initially
dated as of December 4, 2017, and amended from time to time. The factoring facility provides for a financing
volume of up to PLN 40 million, with this limit being reviewed annually.

Under the factoring facility, trade receivables are sold by Silekol sp.z o.o. to Bank Millennium S.A. on a
bi-weekly basis.

The purchase of receivables by Bank Millennium S.A. is made without the recourse to the respective sellers
(with the exception of certain purchase price reductions retained to minimize risk for the buyer of our
receivables).

**Lease Liabilities**

We reported €14.4 million of lease liabilities as non-current liabilities and €9.1 million of lease liabilities as
current liabilities as of December 31, 2020. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations”._

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

_You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the_
_heading “—Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” (i) references to the “Issuer”_
_refer only to PCF GmbH and (ii) references to “we,” “our,” “us” or “Group” refer to the Issuer and the_
_Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries._

The Issuer will issue €400 million aggregate principal amount of Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured
Notes due 2026 (the “Fixed Rate Notes”) and €350 million aggregate principal amount of Sustainability-Linked
Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2026 (the “Floating Rate Notes” and, together with the Fixed Rate
Notes, the “Notes”) under an indenture, to be dated April 22, 2021 (the “Indenture”), among, inter alios, the
Issuer, the Guarantors (as defined below), Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”),
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (in such capacity, the “Security Agent”) and as paying
agent (in such capacity the “Paying Agent”), and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as transfer agent (in such
capacity, the “Transfer Agent”) and registrar (in such capacity, the “Registrar”), in a private transaction that is
not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under,
incorporate by reference or include, or be subject to or refer to, any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, as amended, including Section 316(b) of such act. Consequently, the Holders will not be entitled to
the protections provided under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, to holders of debt securities
issued under a qualified indenture, including among other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the
event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

We will use the proceeds of the Notes sold on the Issue Date: (i) to fully repay the Existing Senior Facilities
(including accrued interest thereon); (ii) to grant a loan to the Parenty so that the Parent may make a distribution
to our Sponsor; and (iii) to pay certain fees and expenses, in each case, as more fully described in this Offering
Memorandum in the section entitled “Use of Proceeds.”

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount. We may, subject to applicable law and the
terms of the Indenture, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Fixed Rate Notes (the “Additional Fixed
_Rate Notes”) and additional Floating Rate Notes (the “Additional Floating Rate Notes” and, together with the_
Additional Fixed Rate Notes, the “Additional Notes”); provided that if the Additional Fixed Rate Notes are not
fungible with the Fixed Rate Notes originally issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes or the Additional
Floating Rate Notes are not fungible with the Floating Rate Notes originally issued for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, respectively, such Additional Fixed Rate Notes or Additional Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, will
be issued with a separate ISIN code or common code or other identifying number, as applicable, from the Fixed
Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, originally issued. We will only be permitted to issue Additional
Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenants restricting the
Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”
and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, each of the
Fixed Rate Notes (together with any Additional Fixed Rate Notes) and Floating Rate Notes (together with any
Additional Floating Rate Notes) will constitute a separate series of Notes, but shall be treated as a single class for
all purposes under the Indenture, including in respect of any amendment, waiver or other modification of the
Indenture, redemption and offers to purchase or any other action by the Holders hereunder, except to the extent
otherwise provided by the Indenture. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,”
references to the “Notes” include the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes and any Additional Fixed
Rate Notes and Floating Rate Notes that are actually issued under the Indenture.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements (as defined below), and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make
payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of
certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the priority of payment for
amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and the
Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. This description does not restate
those agreements in their entirety. Since this description is only a summary of the terms of the Notes, you should
refer to the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents for complete
descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors and your rights because they, and not this

182


-----

summary, define your rights as Holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Notes and the
Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth under “Listing and General Information.”

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders
will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of
other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and will be subject
to certain transfer restrictions.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

   - be general, senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the obligations of the Issuer under the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;

   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (if any);

   - be effectively senior to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer that is not
secured by the Collateral owned by the Issuer, to the extent of the value of such Collateral;

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer that is
secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property
and assets securing such Indebtedness;

   - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that
are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors and lease obligations;

   - be guaranteed on the Issue Date by the Guarantors;

   - mature on April 15, 2026; and

   - be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be
represented by Definitive Registered Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain conditions, amounts recovered in respect
of the Collateral from certain distressed disposals of, or enforcement over, the Collateral will be used to repay
amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain future
indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to be classified as
“super senior” (if any) before any such amounts will be available to repay the Notes, in each case, following the
payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Trustee and the Security
Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and any fees and expenses of any other creditor representative of future
indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture to benefit from such security interests.

**_The Notes Guarantees_**

The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors on the Issue Date. In addition, if required by the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees,” certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may
provide a Notes Guarantee in the future.

The Notes Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

   - be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
not subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee, including obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;

   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee (if any);

183


-----

   - be effectively senior to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of that Guarantor that is not
secured by the Collateral owned by that Guarantor, to the extent of the value of such Collateral;

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that
is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Notes Guarantee, to the extent of the value of
the property and assets securing such Indebtedness; and

   - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor
that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors and lease obligations.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant
Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance or corporate benefit
under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law, as well as to the extent required by
or provided in the Agreed Security Principles. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its
Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may
have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and
_Our Capital Structure—Each Notes Guarantee and security may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement_
_and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_
_enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will_
be subject to the limitations described in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and
_the Security Interests.”_

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €750 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes, consisting of
€400 million in aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate Notes and €350 million in aggregate principal amount
of Floating Rate Notes. The Notes will mature on April 15, 2026. The Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Interest on the Notes will be
calculated on the aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding as set forth under “—Fixed Rate Notes” and
“—Floating Rate Notes” below.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the calculation
of interest on the Notes:

“Assurance Letter” means an assurance letter from an External Reviewer confirming whether the
Sustainability Performance Targets have been met.

“Certification Date” means the date that is 15 days prior to the Step-up Date.

“Emission Reduction Target” means the Issuer’s target to reduce the Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas
Emissions of the Engineered Wood Products Division to 201,670 tons or less by the Testing Date (from the 2020
baseline of the Engineered Wood Products Division of 220,164 tons).

“External Reviewer” means a qualified provider of third-party assurance or attestation services (i.e., and
auditing firm) appointed by the Issuer to review the Issuer’s compliance with the Sustainability Performance
Targets.

“Recycled Wood Utilization Target” means the Issuer’s Target to increase the overall share of recycled
wood used in the products of the Engineered Wood Products Division to at least 44.0% by the Testing Date
(from the 2020 baseline of the Engineered Wood Products Division of 40.3%).

“Testing Date” means December 31, 2022.

“ton” means one metric ton, or 1,000 kilograms.

“Sustainability Performance Targets” means, collectively, the Emission Reduction Target and the Recycled
Wood Utilization Target.

**_Fixed Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of 4.750% per annum. Interest on the Fixed Rate
Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15, commencing on October 15, 2021.
From and including April 15, 2023 (the “Step-up Date”), the interest rate on the Fixed Rate Notes shall increase
by (a) 0.1250% per annum unless the Issuer has achieved the Recycled Wood Utilization Target on the Testing
Date and (b) 0.1250% per annum unless the Issuer has achieved the Emission Reduction Target on the Testing

Date, in each case, as certified by the Issuer to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent) in an Officer’s
Certificate, which shall also include the Assurance Letter, on or prior to the Certification Date (provided that, for
the avoidance of doubt (i) the interest rate on the Fixed Rate Notes shall not increase if the Issuer has met both
Sustainability Performance Targets on the Testing Date, (ii) the increase in the interest rate on the Fixed Rate
Notes on the Step-up Date shall not exceed a total of 0.1250% if either (x) the Issuer has met the Recycled Wood
Utilization Target on the Testing Date but has not met the Emission Reduction Target on the Testing Date or
(y) the Issuer has met the Emission Reduction Target on the Testing Date but has not met the Recycled Wood
Utilization Target on the Testing Date and (iii) in no event shall the total increase in the interest rate on the Fixed
Rate Notes on the Step-up Date exceed 0.2500% (this being the consequence of the Issuer failing to meet both
Sustainability Performance Targets on the Testing Date)). The Trustee and Paying Agent shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on the Officer’s Certificate and Assurance Letter from the Issuer, shall have no duty to inquire
as to or investigate the accuracy of any Assurance Letter or related Officer’s Certificate, verify the attainment of
the Sustainability Performance Targets, or make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to the
attainment of the Sustainability Performance Targets. The Trustee and Paying Agent shall have no liability to the
Issuer, any noteholder or any other Person in acting in good faith on any Assurance Letter and related Officer’s
Certificate. Any increase of the interest rate applicable to the Fixed Rate Notes on the Step-up Date shall also
result in an increase of the optional redemption prices for the Fixed Rate Notes as set forth under “—Optional
_Redemption—Fixed Rated Notes.”_

The Issuer will make each interest payment to the Holders of record on the immediately preceding April 1
and October 1. Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been
paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised
of twelve 30-day months.

**_Floating Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum computed against the principal
outstanding on the Notes (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to EURIBOR (which is subject to a 0%

the purposes of the Indenture (the “Calculation Agent”), which shall initially be Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch.

From and including the Step-up Date, the FRN Margin shall increase by (a) 0.1250% per annum unless the
Issuer has achieved the Recycled Wood Utilization Target on the Testing Date and (b) 0.1250% per annum
unless the Issuer has achieved the Emission Reduction Target on the Testing Date, in each case, as certified by
the Issuer to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent) in an Officer’s Certificate, which shall also include
the Assurance Letter, on or prior to the Certification Date (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt (i) the FRN
Margin shall not increase if the Issuer has met both Sustainability Performance Targets on the Testing Date,
(ii) the increase in the FRN Margin on the Step-up Date shall not exceed a total of 0.1250% if either (x) the
Issuer has met the Recycled Wood Utilization Target on the Testing Date but has not met the Emission
Reduction Target on the Testing Date or (y) the Issuer has met the Emission Reduction Target on the Testing
Date but has not met the Recycled Wood Utilization Target on the Testing Date and (iii) in no event shall the
total increase in the FRN Margin on the Step-up Date exceed 0.2500% (this being the consequence of the Issuer
failing to meet both Sustainability Performance Targets on the Testing Date)). The Trustee and Paying Agent
shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the Officer’s Certificate and Assurance Letter from the Issuer, shall have
no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Assurance Letteror related Officer’s Certificate, verify

and related Officer’s Certificate.

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and
October 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2021. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the
Holders of record on the immediately preceding January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. If the due date for any
payment in respect of any Floating Rate Notes is not a Business Day or a business day at the place at which such
payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next
succeeding Business Day or business day at such place, as the case may be, and will not be entitled to any further
interest or other payment as a result of any such delay. If a regular record date is not a Business Day, the record
date shall not be affected. The Issuer will pay interest to the Holders of record on the Business Day immediately

preceding the applicable interest payment date. The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest from the Issue Date or,
if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid.

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on each Determination
Date, determine the Applicable Rate, and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the Floating Rate
Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount will be calculated
by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes outstanding at the
commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest
Period concerned divided by 360; provided that interest shall only be paid in respect of Floating Rate Notes
outstanding on the applicable interest payment dates.

All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one
hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards
(e.g., 4.876545% (or 0.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or 0.0487655)). All euro amounts used in or
resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one-half euro cent being rounded
upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in
the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be binding on all parties. The Trustee and the Paying
Agent shall not be responsible for, nor incur any liability in connection with, any loss resulting from any
calculation made, or intended to be made, by the Calculation Agent.

The Calculation Agent will, upon the written request of the Holder of any Floating Rate Notes, provide the
interest rate then in effect with respect to the Floating Rate Notes. The rights of holders of beneficial interests in
the Floating Rate Notes to receive payments on such Floating Rate Notes are subject to applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

Interest will be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. The
Applicable Rate on the Floating Rate Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by
applicable law.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the calculation
of interest on the Floating Rate Notes:

“Determination Date,” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period, except that the initial Determination Date will be April 22,
2021.

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for
deposits in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR1 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the
Determination Date; provided, however, that EURIBOR shall never be less than 0.00%. If Reuters Page
EURIBOR1 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the
principal London office (or, at the Issuer’s option, the principal Frankfurt office, Paris office, Amsterdam office
or Brussels office) of each of four major banks in the eurozone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer, to
provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m.,
Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the eurozone inter-bank market for deposits in a
Representative Amount in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest
Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the
Issuer will request each of three major banks in London (or, at the option of the Issuer, Frankfurt, Paris,
Amsterdam or Brussels), as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a
Representative Amount in euros to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is
two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate
for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then
the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt if for any Interest Period the rate determined based on
the procedure specified in this paragraph is less than 0%, EURIBOR shall mean 0% for purposes of determining
the Applicable Rate for such Interest Period.

“eurozone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.

186


-----

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on
but excluding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall
commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and exclude July 15, 2021.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (a) €1.0 million and (b) an amount that is representative for a
single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Page EURIBOR1” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as may
replace that page on that service, or if no such page is available, Bloomberg page “EBF” or such other page as
may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) System is open for the settlement of payments in euro.

If the Issuer determines that the EURIBOR rate is no longer being calculated or administered, or it becomes
illegal for the Calculation Agent to determine any amounts due to be paid, as at the relevant Determination Date,
any alternative rate which has replaced EURIBOR in customary market usage for the purposes of determining
floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, as identified by the Issuer, in consultation with
an Independent Financial Advisor appointed by the Issuer, and promptly thereafter notified by the Issuer to the
Holders and the Calculation Agent, shall be the new rate replacing EURIBOR; provided, however, that if the
Independent Financial Advisor determines that there is no clear market consensus as to whether any rate has
replaced EURIBOR in customary market usage, the Independent Financial Advisor shall determine an
appropriate alternative rate, and the decision of the Independent Financial Advisor will be binding on the Issuer,
the Calculation Agent and the Holders; provided further that any such alternative rate adopted pursuant to this
paragraph shall in all cases never be less than 0.00%. Following the adoption of an alternative rate pursuant to
this paragraph, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such alternative rate.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes_**

The rights of Holders to receive payment of interest on any Global Notes representing the Notes will be
subject to the then applicable procedures of the common depositary and Euroclear and Clearstream. Current
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are to pay interest to their participants of record on the business day
prior to the relevant interest payment date. If the Issuer redeems any Global Notes (as defined below) on a date
that is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and
unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in
whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be
payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes will be made by one or
more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the registered
Holder thereof (initially being the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
_Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained for_
such purposes in London, United Kingdom. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid,
at the option of the Issuer, by check mailed to the address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register
of Holders of Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes.”

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes in London, including the initial Paying
Agent. The initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The
initial Registrar and the initial Transfer Agent will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. The Registrar will
maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the
Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer. A register of the Notes shall be left at
the registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency between the register of Notes kept by the Registrar
and the one kept by the Issuer at its registered office, the register kept by the Issuer shall prevail.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent
for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. The Issuer or any Subsidiary may act as Paying
Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

187


-----

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will initially be issued as follows:

   - each series of Fixed Rate Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant
to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Fixed Rate Notes”) and each
series of Floating Rate Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Floating Rate Notes” and,
together with the 144A Global Floating Rate Notes, the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes
will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream; and

   - each series of Fixed Rate Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Fixed Rate Global Notes”) and each series of Floating
Rate Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “Regulation S Floating Rate Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Fixed
Rate Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global
_Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the_
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in_
Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the
applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book- Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a
Person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation
_S Book-Entry Interests”) of the same series only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the_
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S
under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of 144A
Book-Entry Interests of the same series only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a Person who the transferor reasonably
believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer
Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

No Book Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Fixed Rate Notes (the “Global Fixed Rate
_Notes”), and no Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book Entry Interest in the Global Fixed Rate_
Notes (the “Definitive Registered Fixed Rate Notes”), may be transferred or exchanged for any Book Entry
Interest in any Global Note representing the Floating Rate Notes (the “Global Floating Rate Notes”) or any
Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book Entry Interest in the Global Floating Rate Notes (the
“Definitive Registered Floating Rate Notes”), and no Book Entry Interest in the Global Floating Rate Notes and
no Definitive Registered Floating Rate Note may be transferred or exchanged for any Book Entry Interest in any
Global Fixed Rate Note or any Definitive Registered Fixed Rate Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
in principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of

188


-----

instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It
is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes
issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined
by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof to persons who take delivery thereof in the form of Definitive
Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or
exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish
information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish
certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such
transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with
such transfer or exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer
or exchange of any Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent will be
entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s direct and indirect Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries.
However, in the circumstances described below under “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and
_Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer as_
Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the
Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.

**Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the
obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis
by the Guarantors (each, a “Notes Guarantee” and, collectively, the “Notes Guarantees”). The Guarantors will
also guarantee our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain guarantee limitations as set
out therein.

In addition, as described below “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that
guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility or certain Credit Facility Indebtedness or Public Debt, in each case, of
the Issuer or a Guarantor, in the future shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes
and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles, as provided below in the fourth paragraph under “—Security—General,”
apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and
the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other
things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial
assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital
maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters or where the time or cost of granting the Notes
Guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders.

189


-----

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security
Principles, to comply with general statutory limitations, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, financial
assistance, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules and other similar laws, rules and regulations of any
applicable jurisdiction. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital
_Structure—Each Notes Guarantee and security may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_
_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation,
winding up or reorganization of any of these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will
pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to
the Issuer for application under the Notes. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that are Guarantors accounted for 99% of the unconsolidated total assets, 80% of the unconsolidated
net sales and 94% of the unconsolidated EBITDA of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case,
before intercompany eliminations.

The Issuer is a holding company with its material assets being the Capital Stock of its subsidiaries. As such,
the Issuer will be dependent upon its Subsidiaries for cash to service interest, principal and other payments on the
Notes. The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all
Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the
Issuer’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Issuer or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its
non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s liquidation, winding up or reorganization (and
the consequent right of the holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to
the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer, or such Guarantor is
itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer or such
Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the
non-guarantor Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the non-guarantor Subsidiary senior to that held by the Issuer
or such Guarantor.

Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness by the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not
impose any limitation on the Incurrence by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not
considered Indebtedness under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Notes Guarantees Release_**

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released:

(1) upon (a) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of any Capital Stock of
the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company of such Guarantor) as a result of
which such Guarantor would no longer be a Restricted Subsidiary, or (b) the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or
combination) (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes in accordance with
the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(4) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(5) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(6) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Notes Guarantees”;_

(7) as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(8) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

(9) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under
the Indenture and the Notes.

190


-----

The Trustee and the Security Agent (as applicable) shall each take all necessary actions reasonably
requested by the Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these
provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent on the
part of the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Issuer will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect
any such release, termination or discharge. The Issuer may in its sole discretion elect to have any Notes
Guarantee remain in place, as opposed to being released and shall notify the Trustee of such election.

**Security**

**_General_**

Pursuant to the Security Documents to be entered into, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will (subject to
the Agreed Security Principles) be secured by first-ranking security interests on the Issue Date, over the
following assets:

   - Capital Stock of (i) the Issuer held by the Parent, (ii) Pfleiderer Deutschland GmbH and Silekol sp.z
o.o, in each case, held by the Issuer and (iii) Pfleiderer Neumarkt GmbH, Pfleiderer Gütersloh GmbH
and Pfleiderer Baruth GmbH, in each case, held by Pfleiderer Deutschland GmbH;

   - the material bank accounts of the Issuer, Pfleiderer Deutschland GmbH and Silekol sp.z o.o; and

   - any structural intercompany loan receivables of the Issuer and the Guarantors (collectively, the
“Collateral”).

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the first-ranking security interests over the Collateral securing the
Notes are contractually deemed to rank equally with the security interests that secure (but only to the extent that
such security is expressed to secure those liabilities) (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility,
(ii) certain obligations under hedging arrangements and (iii) certain other future indebtedness permitted to be
incurred under the Indenture. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain conditions,
amounts recovered in respect of the Collateral from certain distressed disposals of, or enforcement over, the
Collateral will be used to repay amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging
obligations and certain future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement to be classified as “super senior” (if any) before any such amounts will be available to repay the
Notes, in each case following the payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility,
the Trustee and the Security Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and any fees and expenses of any other creditor
representative of future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture to benefit from such security
interests.

The Liens on the Collateral to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees are referred to herein collectively
as the “Security Interest.” Any other property or assets over which Security Interest may in the future be granted
to secure obligations under the Notes and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.”

The Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to
maintenance of share capital, fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable
provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with
general statutory limitations, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference,
“thin capitalization” rules and other similar laws, rules and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction. For a
description of such contractual limitations, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The grant and control of the security will also be subject to certain_
Agreed Security Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security
Principles (with “Group” being defined as the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), which provide that
Collateral shall not be created or perfected to the extent that it would:

   - result in any breach of general legal and statutory limitations, capital maintenance rules, corporate
benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin
capitalization,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions,
“exchange control restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, retention
of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements (or analogous restrictions) of any
applicable jurisdiction (provided that to the extent required by the Security Agent before signing any
applicable security, the relevant grantor of security shall use reasonable endeavors (exercised for a

191


-----

specific period but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with
third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be
subject to such limit);

   - result in members of the Group being required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if
they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of
the relevant members of the Group or if it would result in a material risk to the officers of the relevant
grantor of security of contravention of their fiduciary or statutory duties, any applicable legal,
regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction and/or of civil or criminal liability (provided that to
the extent required by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security, the relevant grantor of
security shall use reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specific period but without incurring material
cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or
otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit);

   - result in costs (including adverse effects on or with respect to taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty,
registration taxes, notarial costs & all applicable fees) that are disproportionate to the benefit obtained
by the beneficiaries of that security;

   - relative to any assets subject a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory
constraint or to third party arrangements which prevent or condition those assets from being charged or
assigned (provided that this does not prejudice the relevant entity from using reasonable endeavors
(exercised for a specific period and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to obtain
consent to such charging or assignment);

   - have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant obligor to conduct its operations and
business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Indenture (including dealing with the
secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or all owing to
lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an Applicable Acceleration Event (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) which is continuing);

   - result in security being given by or over any acquired person or asset which are required to support
acquired (or acquisition) indebtedness to the extent such acquired (or acquisition) indebtedness is
permitted by the terms of the Indenture to remain outstanding after an acquisition;

   - result in security being given over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party or any cash
constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any
relevant security document);

   - purport to take security over certain categories of assets in respect of which it is impossible or
impractical to take such security over;

   - result in the creation of security on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions
in the Intercreditor Agreement; and

   - result in guarantees and security being provided by material subsidiaries which are incorporated in
China and any other jurisdiction that the Majority Lenders (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) and the Issuer (each acting reasonably) agree is an excluded jurisdiction (the “Excluded
Jurisdictions”) and no security or guarantees shall be required to be given by members of the Group
incorporated in the Excluded Jurisdictions or by (or over the shares or investments in) any joint venture
or similar arrangement, any minority interest, or (unless it is a borrower under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement), any non-wholly owned member of the Group.

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied in good faith by the
Issuer.

In addition to the release provisions described below, the Security Interest will cease to exist by operation of
law or will be released, depending on the type of security interest, upon the defeasance or discharge of the Notes
as provided in “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” in each case in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Indenture.

There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the enforcement or sale of the Collateral would be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders, and the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes
Guarantees may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Notes
and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Indenture. By its nature, some

192


-----

or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the
Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Notes and Our Capital Structure—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes.” In_
addition, the Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to release the
Security Interest, by reference to the interests of other creditors of the Group. These limitations may include
requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price
confirmed by a valuation. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Collateral, the Issuer
and the Guarantors, as the case may be, will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of
the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest
and dispose of any income therefrom and, in respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral, will be permitted
to retain entitled and to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash rights to
dividends and other distributions (to the extent not prohibited by the Indenture), stock dividends, liquidating
dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue,
warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing).

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to the Hedging Obligations secured by
the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably
appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent, trustee, joint and several creditor and/or beneficiary of any
applicable parallel debt under the Intercreditor Agreement and with respect to the Security Interest, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. The creditors under the Revolving Credit
Facility, the counterparties to the Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by
accepting a Note, each holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform
the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor
Agreement or the Security Documents, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions, and
(ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be
executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of
the Holders) to enter into, or where applicable accede to, the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the
provisions described in the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents and perform
the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other
incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into, or where
applicable accede to, and comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any
waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the
Security Agent on its behalf).

See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—The security
_interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes._
_The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant security over the Collateral to
secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and the obligations of the Guarantors under

193


-----

their respective Notes Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by, inter alios,
the relevant Security Provider and the Security Agent.

The Security Agent will enter into the Security Documents in its own name for the benefit of, inter alios, the
Trustee and the Holders. The Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations and other secured Indebtedness Incurred after
the Issue Date (who will have the equal and ratable benefit of the same Collateral). The Security Agent will also
act on behalf of certain future secured creditors who are permitted to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof.

The Security Documents will provide that the rights with respect to the Collateral must be exercised by the
Security Agent or the parties to the Security Documents. Since the Holders are not a party to the Security
Documents, Holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their
favor under the Security Documents. The Holders may only act through the Security Agent.

The Security Agent will agree to any release of the Security Interest created by the Security Documents that
is in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the
Holders. See “—Release of Liens” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—
_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of Notes under which the Collateral securing the_
_Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Notes Guarantees will be_
_released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.” In addition, the terms of the Security_
Documents and Intercreditor Agreement themselves provide for assets to cease to become subject to the security
interests in certain circumstances without need for a formal release, such as the sale of assets which are subject to
a charge, or the exclusion of certain assets from a debenture if such assets may not be subject to security (such as,
for example, assets that may not be validly pledged, or assets that are subject to a Permitted Lien). The Security
Agent will commence enforcement action under the Security Documents only in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement. See “—Enforcement of Security Interest.”

In the event that the Issuer or any of the Guarantors enters into insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution or
similar proceedings, the Security Interest created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations
enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the
validity of the Security Interest or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders might
not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Notes and Our Capital Structure—Each Notes Guarantee and security may be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_
_enforceability.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

Release of the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(1) other than the Liens over the Capital Stock of the Issuer held by the Parent, in connection with any sale or
other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding
any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other
disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of
_Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture or (b) any Restricted_
Subsidiary; provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or
intercompany loan receivables to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Securitization Subsidiary) unless the
relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Notes
following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such

194


-----

Unrestricted Subsidiary, and the release of any assets designated by the Issuer as Securitization Assets in
connection with a Securitization Facility;

(6) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

(7) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with
the provisions of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest.”_

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably requested
by the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and/
or the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent
without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect
such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely conclusively upon an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving
rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred, and that such release complies with the Indenture.

**_Enforcement of Security Interests_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to
enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security
Documents in certain circumstances upon certain distressed disposals or enforcement by the Security Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of_
_the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar_
arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the
Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the
Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such
Indebtedness, including the Security Documents. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note,
each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, to (i) perform
the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights,
power and discretions and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or
replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that on or following certain Equity Offerings (or in contemplation
of certain Equity Offerings with respect to the release of security if required to implement such Equity Offering),
the Issuer shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the trustee under the Indenture (a “Pushdown Notice”))
that the terms of the Indenture and the other Debt Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) shall
operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) as described under “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—IPO Debt Pushdown.”_

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, and except as described under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Notes
are not redeemable at the option of the Issuer.

**_Fixed Rate Notes_**

At any time prior to April 15, 2023, the Issuer may redeem the Fixed Rate Notes, in whole or in part, at its
option, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of such Fixed Rate Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Fixed Rate Notes redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.

Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to 104.750% of the principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes so
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes redeemed to, but
excluding, the redemption date in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed 40% of
the original aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes (including the original principal amount of any
Additional Fixed Rate Notes); provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes (including Additional
Fixed Rate Notes) issued under the Indenture remains outstanding immediately thereafter (excluding Fixed
Rate Notes held by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and unless all of the other Fixed Rate
Notes are otherwise redeemed substantially concurrently therewith).

At any time and from time to time on or after April 15, 2023, the Issuer may redeem the Fixed Rate Notes in
whole or in part, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to the
percentage of principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes so redeemed set forth below plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on the Fixed Rate Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date and

applicable to the Fixed Rate Notes set forth in the immediately preceding table shall increase (i) with respect to
the call premium applicable to the Notes from (and including) April 15, 2023 until (but excluding) April 15,

**_Post-Tender Redemption_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of
Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount
of the then outstanding Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as they case may be, validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of
the Issuer, purchases, all of the Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as they case may be, validly tendered
and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to
redeem the Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, that remain outstanding in whole, but not in
part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder of the Fixed Rate Notes or
Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer, plus, to the
extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

**_General_**

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, we may
repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the
redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date
in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and no additional interest will be
payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes
or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**_Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund_**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as
described under “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock.”_

**_Selection and Notice_**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the book entry interests in such Global Note from the amount
received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection
with the redemption of such book entry interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof).
Under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at
any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis by
way of pool factor in accordance with the rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream (as applicable), on
such basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no book entry interest of less than €100,000
principal amount may be redeemed in part. If the Notes are not held through Euroclear and Clearstream the Notes
will be selected on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note in an unauthorized denomination
remains outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, that no Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal
amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 shall be redeemed. The
Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address of such
Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days
prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture.

197


-----

Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of a
transaction (including an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other
transaction) and any redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent,
including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if
applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time
(provided, however, that any redemption date shall not be more than 60 days after the date of the notice of
redemption) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and
such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the
redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that
payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption
may be performed by another Person.

If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent the
rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice to the Holders of the
relevant Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any change in the
principal amount of Notes outstanding.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be
issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an
appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to
the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any
conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and
after the redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to
accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date
fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below
under “—Withholding Taxes,” if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a
result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, introduction of, or change in an official written application, administration or
interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings (including by reason of a
holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative
practice), (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes or the Notes Guarantee,
as applicable, would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes or the Notes Guarantee, as
applicable (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made
by another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts, or the
Issuer), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly
announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions
shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on
the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the
Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party
to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of

198


-----

Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the
foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is
entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to
its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by
the relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax
counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction to the effect that the
Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The
Trustee and the Paying Agent will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as
sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in
which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to the laws and official positions of any jurisdiction in
which any successor to a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes or any
political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein. The foregoing provisions will survive any
termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
“Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and
clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the
withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by interpretation or administration thereof. If
any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Notes Guarantee is made by or on
behalf of the Payor or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the
power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes,
or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing
_Jurisdiction”),_

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with
respect to any Note or any Notes Guarantee, including (without limitation) payments of principal, redemption
price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the
“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of
such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction from such
Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received by each Holder in
respect of such payments on any such Note or Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction;
_provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or
former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member,
partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate,
nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of,
or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place of management present or
deemed present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each
case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of
any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the
beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the
Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or
deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning
the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or
similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law,
statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax, but, in each case, only to the extent the
Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

199


-----

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment (where
Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after
the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for payment
to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the
Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of principal,
premium or interest on or with respect to the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or
otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, in each case,
as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable), any current or
future regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, similar law or regulation, rule or
practice implementing an intergovernmental agreement, treaty or convention relating thereto; or

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership
or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with
respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies
of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable
evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent).
Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the
offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or
any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee
and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the
amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay
Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises
less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s
Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely
solely, without further enquiry, on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are
necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee, such reference
shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional
Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration,
court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect
thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest
or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in (i) a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance,
delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments, or (ii) any jurisdiction in the case of stamp taxes in
connection with an enforcement, with respect to any Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other
document or instrument in relation thereto (limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies
that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar
charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (6)).

200


-----

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise resident for
tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any
Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Person, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or
agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party
makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently
therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional
_Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes (equal to €100,000 or in integral_
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided, that Notes of €100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole
and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
to but excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on
or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose name the Notes are registered at the
close of business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase date. No later than 60 days following
any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change
of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by
first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the
security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to
repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no
earlier than 30 days and no later than the later of (x) 60 days from the date such notice is delivered and (y) the
date of completion of the Change of Control Triggering Event, pursuant to the procedures required by the
Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in
advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by
virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC
will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a
default under the Revolving Credit Facility that permits the lenders thereunder to accelerate the maturity of
borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries may contain
prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such
Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the
Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such
Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of
such repurchase on the Issuer.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control
Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be
available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase
feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and,
thus, the removal of incumbent management. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the
future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would
not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of
Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on
our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in_
the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes

201


-----

then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain
any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise
in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by
the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or
(ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under
“—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the
applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent
contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a
Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event; provided, however,
that such Change of Control Offer is conditional upon such Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case
law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control
Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the
rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the
avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer will not issue Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries to issue Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Issuer and any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer may issue Disqualified
Stock and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may issue Preferred Stock, if on the date of such Incurrence and
after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is at least 2.00 to 1.00.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under any Credit Facility (and
the issuance and creation of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) in an
aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the sum of an amount equal to the greater
of €105 million and 69% of LTM EBITDA, in each case, at any one time outstanding, provided, that any
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) may be refinanced at any time if the principal amount of
the Indebtedness Incurred in such refinancing does not exceed the greater of (I) the aggregate principal
amount of Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) on the date of determination for
such refinancing and (II) the aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced at such time,
together with an amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including
any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses
(including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred or payable in connection with such
refinancing;

(including an acquisition of any assets), Investment, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, capital
expenditure or other similar transaction, (y) of Persons that are, or secured by any assets that are, acquired
by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged into, amalgamated or consolidated with the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or (z) in respect of any Acquired
Indebtedness; provided that Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this paragraph (5) is in an aggregate amount
not to exceed (a) the greater of (i) €23 million and (ii) 15% of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, plus
(b) unlimited additional Indebtedness to the extent that after giving effect to such acquisition, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or capital expenditure and without giving effect to any Indebtedness Incurred
or issued pursuant to sub-clause (5)(a) above on the date of determination, either: (i) the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries would be permitted to Incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the
first paragraph of this covenant; or (ii) either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower, or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer
would not be higher, in each case, than it was immediately prior to such acquisition, Investment, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, capital expenditure or similar transaction;

construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment that is used or useful
in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person
owning such assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness in an
aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (a) and then outstanding, does not exceed the greater of
€39 million and 25% of LTM EBITDA at any time outstanding, and any Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect thereof (provided that, in each case, the Indebtedness exists on the date of such purchase, lease,
rental, construction, design, installation or improvement or is created within 270 days thereafter) or
(b) arising out of Sale and Leaseback Transactions (provided that the aggregate principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this sub-clause (b), together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (b) and then outstanding, shall not exceed €30 million at any
time outstanding);

(17) Indebtedness of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors and Guarantees by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of joint ventures, in each case, which, when taken together with the
principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (17) and then outstanding, will
not in an aggregate amount exceed the greater of €31 million and 20% of LTM EBITDA at any time

respect thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or
any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled to
be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify,
and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include, in any
manner that complies with this covenant, the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in the first paragraph above or one of the clauses of the second
paragraph of this covenant, and Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by
reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision
and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; provided that any
amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date shall be deemed to be incurred
under clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

(2) with respect to any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to a clause limited by a fixed euro amount in the second
paragraph of this covenant, if at any time that the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would be
entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant (other than to the extent such reclassification would
result in any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the preceding paragraph to not be entitled to
priority with respect to the proceeds from a distressed disposal of, or enforcement of, the Collateral pursuant
to the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens);

(3) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a
Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” or “clean down”
provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be

205


-----

repaid periodically shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date
such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof;

(4) in the case of any refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such Indebtedness,
such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and
expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs
and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred or payable in
connection with such refinancing;

(5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular
amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause of the second
paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of
a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase
price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference
thereof;

(8) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant
measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing
would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the
percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction
shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does
not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender
premiums), defeasance, costs, indemnities, discounts and other costs and expenses (including original issue
discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing; and

(9) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to
the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion
or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the
payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be
deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “Limitation on
_Indebtedness” covenant; provided that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding_
Indebtedness may (in the Issuer’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or
capitalized interest, accreted value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such
Indebtedness and such increased amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating
any basket, permission or threshold under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is
not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant)._

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the euro equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than the
euro shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was
first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower euro equivalent); provided that (a) if such
Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than the euro, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed (x) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of fees,
underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and

206


-----

expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such
refinancing, (b) the euro equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue
Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date, and (c) if any
such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Hedging Obligation (with respect to
the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed
in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

Restricted Payment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any
cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment,
property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer acting in good faith.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a

indirect” action by the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and the Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or
profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case
of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (i) Permitted Liens or (ii) Liens on property or assets
that are not Permitted Liens if the obligations under the Notes (or a Notes Guarantee in the case of Liens on
assets of a Guarantor) and the Indenture are directly secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, equally
and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness
secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or
asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes under (a)(ii) in the preceding paragraph will be automatically
and unconditionally released and discharged upon (x) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it
relates, and (y) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of

213


-----

original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to
other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction.

in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the Indenture or securing

mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements; (c) contained in any trading, netting, operating,
construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or other agreement to which the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries is a party entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of
relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at
least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Issuer of the shares and assets
subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a
Permitted Asset Swap);

215


-----

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition
(including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise) received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the
form of cash or Cash Equivalents; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (i) to prepay, repay,
redeem or purchase any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case,
other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary), any Indebtedness secured on
assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that does not constitute Collateral, any Senior Secured
Indebtedness or any other Indebtedness under any Credit Facility Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (or any refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof) within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset
Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that, in connection with
any prepayment, repayment, redemption or purchase of Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility or any other working capital facility) pursuant to this
clause (a), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the
related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid,
repaid or purchased; (ii) to (A) purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise or (B) redeem Notes
pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the Indenture; provided that, in each case, the
relevant purchase, repurchase or redemption is launched, or the relevant redemption notice is delivered,
within, 365 days from the later of (x) the date of such Asset Disposition and (y) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash; or (iii) to make an Asset Disposition Offer in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture; provided further that to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to
prepay, repay or purchase any amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness at a price not less than par and
has extended such offer to the Holders on at least a pro rata basis, to the extent the creditors in respect
of such Senior Secured Indebtedness (including any Holders) elect not to tender their Senior Secured
Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or purchase, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will
be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered under
this sub-clause (a), and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds;

(b) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or purchase or commit to invest
in or purchase Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets equal to
the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) within
365 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash; provided, however, that a binding agreement shall be treated as a permitted application
of Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment with the good faith expectation that an
amount equal to Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of
such commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event of any Acceptable Commitment is
later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such amount is applied in connection therewith,
then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds;

(c) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, following an Asset Disposition of the
Silekol Division, within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the
receipt of such Net Available Cash, make Restricted Payments or declares that it will make a Restricted
Payment in an amount not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds from the Asset Disposition of the Silekol
Division, so long as, immediately after giving pro forma effect to such Restricted Payment or the
declaration of such Restricted Payment, the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio shall be no greater
than 4.40 to 1.00; or

(d) to consummate any combination of the foregoing,

_provided that, (1) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with_
clauses (a) through (c) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or
otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture; and (2) the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary (as the case may be) may elect to invest in Additional Assets prior to receiving the Net
Available Cash attributable to any given Asset Disposition (provided that such investment shall be made no
earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the relevant Asset Disposition, execution of a definitive
agreement for the relevant Asset Disposition or consummation of the relevant Asset Disposition) and deem the

216


-----

amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with clause (b) above with respect to such Asset
Disposition.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (1) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of
any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary of the Issuer to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (to the
extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including
financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors)
or (2) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer,
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in
material adverse Tax consequences that are not de minimis, as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, the
portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this
covenant and shall not constitute Excess Proceeds.

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed
to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to constitute “Excess
_Proceeds” under the Indenture. On the 366th day after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net_
Available Cash (or (i) such earlier date as the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries may elect or (ii) such later date
as set forth in clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant), if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds
under the Indenture exceeds the greater of €39 million and 25% of LTM EBITDA, the Issuer will within 10
Business Days, be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of Notes issued under
such Indenture and, to the extent the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary elects, to all holders of other
outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and to repay, prepay
or purchase any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased
out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes and not more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each
case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repayment, prepayment or
purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as applicable, and which may include in the case of such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is Public
Debt, such higher price as may be contemplated by the agreement governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness
(provided that such agreement has not been amended or modified to provide for such higher price in connection
with such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption and provided further that the excess over 100% of the
principal amount shall not be paid with Excess Proceeds), and with respect to the, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver notice of such Asset
Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each
Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with
the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified
in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is
delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the and described in such notice. The Issuer may satisfy the
foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset
Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 365 days (or such
longer period provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. If
the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari
Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the
Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or
purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and such Pari
Passu Indebtedness. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be
reset at zero. Additionally, the Issuer may, at its option, make an Asset Disposition Offer using proceeds from
any Asset Disposition at any time after the consummation of such Asset Disposition. Upon consummation or
expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess
Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of
funds in euro that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into euro.

217


-----

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) and the release of the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset
Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee
that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days
following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset
Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any
Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset
Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of
€31 million and 20% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in
value);

(6) consideration consisting of Additional Assets; and

(7) any combination of the consideration specified in the preceding clauses (1) through (6).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities
laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by
virtue thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the Indenture relative
to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be
waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding.

The Revolving Credit Facility may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to
which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this
covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its
lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If
the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the
Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under
the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any transaction or
series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of
any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an
“Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of €16 million and 10% of LTM
EBITDA unless:

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction
in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of €23 million
and 15% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been approved by a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer.

218


-----

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (ii) of this
paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Issuer, if
any.

The provisions of preceding paragraph above will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Investment, or any distribution, write off, set-off, discount, surrender,_
cancellation or forgiveness of a Parent Entity RP Loan;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other

arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements, options,
warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent
Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans,
transaction bonuses or transaction-related securities repurchase plans or similar employee benefits or
consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement,

employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case, in the
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) (a) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries and
(b) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity, provided that such Parent Entity
shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital
Stock of the Issuer and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise permitted under the
Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including
under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,
directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees of the Issuer, any Parent Entity or any
Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Controlled Investment
Affiliate of such directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries under the
terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any
agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and instruments may be
amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in accordance with
the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material
respect;

(7) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing or Securitization Facility, any
disposition or repurchase of Securitization Assets or related assets in connection with any Qualified
Securitization Financing or Securitization Facility;

purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case, in the ordinary course of business or consistent with
past practice, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable
determination of the Board of Directors or the senior management of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such
time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction
solely (i) because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such
Affiliate, Associate or similar entity or (ii) due to the fact that a director of such Person is also a director of
the Issuer, a Restricted Subsidiary or any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer (provided, however,
that such director abstains from voting as a director of the Issuer, a Restricted Subsidiary or such direct or
indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other Person);

(10) (a) any issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred Stock) of
the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder
Funding and the granting of registration and other customary rights (and the performance of the related
obligations) in connection therewith or any contribution to capital of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary

professional fees and expenses) related to the Transactions;

(14) transactions in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee a
letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating either (x) that such transaction is fair to the Issuer or

(23) any lease entered into between the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as lessee, and any Affiliate of the
Issuer that is not a Restricted Subsidiary, as lessor, which is approved by a majority of the members of the
Board of Directors of the Issuer;

(24) intellectual property licenses in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(25) payments to or from, and transactions with, any joint venture, including for the avoidance of doubt, the entry
into, and performance of obligations and related services under, any management services agreement or any
licensing agreement with regard to any existing or future joint venture, in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice (including any cash management activities related thereto);

(26) any participation in a public tender or exchange offer for securities or debt instruments issued by, the Issuer
or any of its Subsidiaries that provides for the same price or exchange ratio, as the case may be, to all
holders accepting such tender or exchange offer;

(27) the payment of costs and expenses related to registration rights and customary indemnities provided to
shareholders under any shareholder agreement; and the entry into, and performance of obligations and
related services under, any registration rights or other listing agreement;

(28) any Permitted Tax Restructuring; and

(29) employment and severance arrangements between the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors, managers, contractors, consultants, distributors and employees in the ordinary
course of business or entered into in connection with or as a result of the Transactions.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause an Event of Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the
aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in
the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time
of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition of
Permitted Investments, as determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment
would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary. The Issuer may re-designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that
redesignation would not cause an Event of Default.

221


-----

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (and any re-designation of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary) will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions and was permitted
by the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of the
definition of Permitted Investments (as determined by the Issuer). If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary
would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to
be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as
of such date under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer will be in default of
such covenant.

The Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided
that such designation will be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any
outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (a) such
Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (including
pursuant to clause (5) of the second paragraph thereof treating such redesignation as an acquisition for the
purpose of such clause), calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of
the applicable reference period and (b) no Event of Default would be in existence immediately following such
designation.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 150 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 and within 120 days after
the end of each of the Issuer’s fiscal years thereafter, annual reports containing: (a) an operating and
financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial
condition, results of operations and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer;
(b) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (unless
such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below);
_provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without_
unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired
company financial information; (c) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end of the
most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the
Issuer for the most recent two fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for
and as at the end of such fiscal years and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements;
(d) a brief description of the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer, all material Affiliate
Transactions and a description of all material debt instruments of the Group; (e) a description of material
operational risk factors and material subsequent events; and (f) reported EBITDA; provided that the
information described in clauses (d), (e) and (f) may be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial
statements;

(2) within 90 days with respect to the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021 and thereafter, within 60 days
following the end of each of the first, second and third fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer,
beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2021, quarterly financial statements containing the following
information: (a) the Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter
and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date period
ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of
the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to
which such quarterly report relates; provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided
only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case
of a material acquisition, acquired company financial information; (c) an operating and financial review of
the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of
operations and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer; (d) a discussion of material

222


-----

changes in material debt instruments since the most recent report; (e) material subsequent events and any
material changes to the operational risk factors disclosed in the most recent annual report; and (f) reported
EBITDA; provided that the information described in clauses (d), (e) and (f) may be provided in the
footnotes to the unaudited financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any acquisition,
disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary that is
material to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or
director changes at the Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such
event.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long
as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the
Securities Act.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of
such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis
for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the
reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on
a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of
the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure
not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required
to contain any reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s pro forma total revenue or
Consolidated EBITDA or total assets as of and for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly
financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “Reports”
covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the
footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In the event that (i) any Parent Entity or the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues
to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) such Parent Entity or the Issuer elects to provide
to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the
reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects,
the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that
such Parent Entity or the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or
15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements and, in case of a Parent Entity, subject to the second
succeeding paragraph, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in this
“Reports” covenant.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English
translation.

At its election, the Issuer may provide consolidated financial statements of (x) one of its Restricted
Subsidiaries or (y) a Parent Entity, in each case, in lieu of those for the Issuer, in which case references to the
Issuer in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the preceding paragraph will be deemed to be references to such Restricted
Subsidiary or the Parent Entity, as applicable; provided that if the consolidated financial statements of such
Restricted Subsidiary or the Parent Entity, as the case may be, are included in such report, a qualitative
description of material differences between the consolidated financial statements of such Restricted Subsidiary or
the Parent Entity, as the case may be, and the Issuer shall be included for any period after the Issue Date.

If and for so long as the equity securities of the Issuer or a Parent Entity are listed on a Recognized Stock
Exchange and the Issuer or a Parent Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to

223


-----

issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on a Recognized Stock Exchange, for so long as it elects, the
Issuer will be entitled to make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other
reports that the Issuer or a Parent Entity is, or would be, required to file with the Recognized Stock Exchange.
Upon complying with the foregoing sentence and the preceding paragraph, and provided that such requirements
require the Issuer or a Parent Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and other reports
with a Recognized Stock Exchange and the Issuer additionally provides the reports set forth in paragraph
(2) above with respect to its first and third fiscal quarters, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the
provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs in this covenant. “Recognized Stock Exchange” means a
regulated market operated by any of Euronext, the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, the London Stock
Exchange (including, for the avoidance of doubt, AIM and Main Market listings), the Deutsche Börse, the Paris
Stock Exchange Group, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Milan Stock Exchange, the Toronto Stock
Exchange, TSX Venture Exchange, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange, the Singapore Exchange or such other similar regulated national securities exchange.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently
omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the
Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens
shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral)
for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders
and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (a) the Parent,
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise
modify or replace any Security Documents, for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens, (b) the
Parent, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or
otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents, for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted
Reorganization or in connection with a transaction not prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—Merger and
_Consolidation,” (c) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the Indenture, the_
applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (d) the
applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time (i) to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission,
defect, error or inconsistency therein, (ii) to add to the Collateral, (iii) to evidence the succession of another
Person to the Parent, the Issuer or any Security Provider and the assumption of such successor of the obligations
under the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Security Documents, in each case,
including in accordance with the terms under “—Merger and Consolidation,” and (iv) to evidence and provide
for the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Agent, (e) the applicable Security
Documents may be amended from time to time in any manner that does not adversely affect Holders of the Notes
in any material respect (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) and (f) the Security Interests and the related
Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or
released if there is a substantially concurrent retaking of a Lien over the same assets or class of assets; provided,
_however, that in the case of clauses (a) and (f) above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended,_
renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any
such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Security Agent, either (1) a solvency opinion, in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming
the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a
certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and
the Security Agent, which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect
to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and
the Security Agent, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the
Security Documents, as amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced, are
valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law,
that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event that the Parent, the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall

224


-----

(subject to customary protections and indemnifications and each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being
indemnified and secured to its satisfaction) consent to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release or other modification or replacement without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Additional Notes Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, no
Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee Indebtedness outstanding under a Credit Facility or Public Debt, in each
case, in an aggregate principal amount in excess of €50 million, in each case, of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless
such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor at substantially the same time at which the Guarantee of
such other Indebtedness is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental
indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes
Guarantee, which Notes Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu, as applicable, with such Restricted
Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not
be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee
is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (a) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules,
capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules, retention of title claims or the laws, rules or
regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (b) any risk or liability for the officers,
directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the
partners of such partnership); or (c) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any
Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may
contain limitations on guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses
generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law (including any usury
laws).

The Issuer shall be entitled at its option at any time to procure that the Parent Entity of which the Issuer is a
direct Subsidiary may issue a Guarantee in respect of the Notes (such entity, the “Parent Guarantor”). So long as
such entity is subject to a customary high yield “holding company” covenant (which shall include a customary
merger covenant), references to the “Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries” in the following covenants and
sections of the Indenture summarized in this “Description of Notes” shall be deemed to refer to the “Parent
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries” and applicable references to the “Issuer” in its capacity as the Person
that directly and indirectly owns the Capital Stock of all of the Restricted Subsidiaries in the group of Persons
bound by the following covenants and sections (and the related definitions contained in the Indenture) shall be
deemed to refer to the “Parent Guarantor”:

   - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

   - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

   - “—Limitation on Liens”;

   - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

   - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

   - “—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries;

   - “—Impairment of Security Interest”;

   - “—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”;

   - “—Events of Default”;

   - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”; and

   - “—Reports”;

The Issuer and the Guarantors shall be entitled to enter into a Supplemental Indenture without the consent of
any Holder to give effect to the foregoing.

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to the first paragraph of this provision shall be released as set
forth under “—Notes Guarantees—Notes Guarantees Release” or in accordance with the terms of the

225


-----

Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents. A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be
released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor
outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with
the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date.
The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by
the Issuer to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to
customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes
_and Our Capital Structure—Each Notes Guarantee and security may be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_
_enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer
or its Restricted Subsidiaries of (x) any Indebtedness secured on Collateral or as otherwise required herein and
(y) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Issuer, the
relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such
Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor
_Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on_
substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders
(taken as a whole)), including substantially the same terms with respect to release of Notes Guarantees and
priority and release of the Security Interests; provided that (1) such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security
Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, protections, indemnifications, liabilities or immunities of
the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor
Agreement and (2) if more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any one time, the correlative
terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest
error or inconsistency of any such agreement; (2) increase the amount or types (including new Credit Facilities)
of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of
payment to the Notes); (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes); (5) to facilitate a Permitted
Reorganization; (6) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes;
(7) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens; (8) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof; or (9) make any other change to any such
agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect, making all
necessary provisions to ensure that the Notes and the Notes Guarantees are secured by senior ranking Liens over
the Collateral. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the
Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise
permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers,” and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect
their respective rights, duties, liabilities, protections, indemnifications or immunities under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations

226


-----

subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to
and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person,
unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”) (if not the Issuer) will be a Person
organized or incorporated and existing under the laws of Jersey, any member state of the European Union,
the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Canada or the United States of America, any State of the United
States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume (a) by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes and (b) all obligations of the
Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of such transaction as
having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer (as the case
may be) would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of
the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be higher, in each case, than it was immediately prior to
giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the
effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the
Indenture, and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) is a legal, valid
and binding agreement, enforceable against the Successor Issuer; provided that in giving an Opinion of
Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact (including as to satisfaction
of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above).

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer which properties and assets,
if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of the Issuer, on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company
will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

_The Guarantors_

None of the Guarantors (other than a Guarantor whose Notes Guarantee is to be released in accordance with
the terms of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it,

227


-----

unless:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor;
or

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor or the Issuer is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee
and the Indenture and all obligations of the Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which it is a party (as applicable);
and (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default shall have occurred and
is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a
Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Guarantor (in each case
other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture.

_General_

The provisions set forth in this “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not
apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or
liquidating into or assigning, transferring, leasing or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a
Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and
assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor;
_provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will_
assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer”
shall apply to such transaction; and (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining
with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity,
reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however,
that clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clause (B) under the heading “—The Guarantors,”
as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction.

The foregoing provisions shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may
implement a Permitted Reorganization.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture (including
those based on LTM EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
and/or Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio), in each case, in connection with any acquisition, disposition,
dividend, merger, joint venture, Investment, Incurrence, Change of Control or other similar transaction where
there is a time difference between commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of Incurrence of
Indebtedness, Restricted Payments, Change of Control and Permitted Investments), the date of determination of
such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, either (x) be the date
of any announcement, definitive agreement, written commitment or put option (conditional or otherwise) for
such acquisition, disposition, dividend, merger, joint venture, Investment, Incurrence, Change of Control or
similar transaction or (y) the date of such acquisition, disposition, dividend, merger, joint venture, Investment,
Incurrence, Change of Control or similar transaction and, in each case, such baskets or ratios shall be calculated
on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such acquisition, disposition, dividend, merger, joint venture,
Investment, Incurrence, Change of Control or similar transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in
connection therewith (including any Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment, Asset Disposition, Incurrence or
repayment of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable
Relevant Testing Period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for
purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio).

228


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, (1) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in
such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in LTM EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Total
Net Indebtedness, Senior Secured Indebtedness or cash and Cash Equivalents of the Issuer or the target company)
subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction, such
baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of
determining whether the transactions are permitted hereunder; and (2) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at
the time of consummation of such transaction or related transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer elects to
have such determinations occur at the time of the announcement or the entry into such definitive agreement,
written commitment or put option (conditional or otherwise), any such transactions (including any Restricted
Payment, Permitted Investment, Asset Disposition, Change of Control or Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use
of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date of the announcement or the date the definitive
agreement, written commitment or put option (conditional or otherwise) are entered into, as applicable, and
outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such
announcement, agreement or put option (conditional or otherwise), as applicable, and before the consummation
of such transactions.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day:

(a) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following
headings (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

   - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

   - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

   - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

   - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

   - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

   - “—Impairment of Security Interest”;

   - “—Additional Notes Guarantees”; and

   - the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer,”

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be
applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

If at any time the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants will
thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and be applicable
pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to
determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the subsequently attain Investment Grade
Status (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Notes maintain
an Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be
deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Notes Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants
based on, and none of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with respect to such
Suspended Covenants for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions
taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether
such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect
during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is
referred to as the “Suspension Period.”

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of
“—Limitation on Indebtedness.” On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period
will be considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11) of such definition. Calculations made after the

229


-----

Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” will be made as though the covenants described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had_
been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted
Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted
Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds
shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement
entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it
is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate
_Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action_
described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from
_Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on_
the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation
_on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” On and after each Reversion Date, the Issuer and_
its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract
entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been
permitted during such Suspension Period.

In addition, any future obligation to grant further Notes Guarantees shall be released. Subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, all obligations to grant Notes Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any
knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment
Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions
under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification shall not be a condition for suspension of the
covenants to be effective.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days (or, in the case of an obligation set out in
“—Certain Covenants—Reports,” 120 days) after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or
by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any agreement
or obligation contained in the Indenture;

(4) the occurrence of a default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or
by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed which is Incurred or
Guaranteed by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof,
which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its Stated Maturity (after giving effect to any
applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross acceleration
_provision”),_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its
Stated Maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates €35 million or more at any one time outstanding;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary (the
“bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €35 million
other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and

230


-----

creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of
more than 60 days (after receipt of notice as described in the next succeeding paragraph) after such
judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement
proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly
stayed (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents with respect to a material portion of the Collateral shall,
at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant
Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture)
for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any
such Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such Security Interest created
thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert
in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 30
days; and

(8) except as permitted by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(including with respect to any limitations), any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of a Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor constituting a Significant Subsidiary is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or
invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect for any reason

Notwithstanding any other term of this “Description of the Notes” or the Indenture, no Permitted
Reorganization shall (or shall be deemed to) constitute, or result in, a breach of any undertaking or other term in
this “Description of the Notes” or the Indenture, or a Default or an Event of Default, and shall be expressly
permitted under the terms of this “Description of the Notes” or the Indenture. Furthermore, for the avoidance of
doubt, it will not constitute an Event of Default if the Issuer fails to satisfy any of the Sustainability Performance
Targets on the Testing Date, and the sole recourse of Holders in such instance shall be the right to receive the
applicable increase in (i) interest rate, in the manner described under the heading “—Principal, Maturity and
_Interest” and (ii) in call premium applicable to the Fixed Rate Notes, in the manner described under the heading_
“—Optional Redemption—Fixed Rate Notes.”

However, a Default under clauses (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the
Issuer of the Default and, with respect to such clauses (4) and (6), the Issuer does not cure such Default within
60 days after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee, by written notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may, and the Trustee (subject to certain
conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an
Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration
of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the Event of Default or payment default triggering
such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the
Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in
each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the
acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and
may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all
past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal or interest as
described in clauses (1) and (2) above, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than
90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect
to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

231


-----

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another
default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and
(ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant
entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other
provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such
covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period
specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or
security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, fees, liability or expense. No Holder
may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee
to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the
offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

A Holder may not use the Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of another Holder, to obtain a
preference or priority over another Holder or to enforce any right under the Indenture except in the manner herein
provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all Holders (it being understood that the Trustee does not have
an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such
Holders).

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its
powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee,
however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or
security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by
taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the
Trustee has received written notice, and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the
Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in
the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may
withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of
the Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 150 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year
ending December 31, 2021 and within 120 days after the end of each of the Issuer’s fiscal years thereafter
beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers
thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous fiscal year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the
Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which
would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect
thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to
certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). If any amendment, supplement or
waiver will only affect the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes, only the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes (and not the consent
of the holders of the majority of all Notes), as the case may be, shall be required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (9) below,
75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes (provided, however, that if any amendment,
supplement, waiver or other modification or consent will only affect the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate
Notes, only the consent of the holders of at least 90% (or, in the case of clause (9) of this paragraph, 75%) of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes will be required), an
amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other than
provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of, or extend the Stated Maturity of, any such Note (other than provisions relating to
Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such
Note may be redeemed, in each case, as described above under “—Optional Redemption” or “—
_Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;_

(4) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(5) amend the contractual right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal
of, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(6) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes in a
way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption
from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees
to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral (taken
as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture; provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the release of less than all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders
in the Collateral (taken as a whole) shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase
of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and any default or compliance with any provisions thereof
may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer
for, Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at
least a majority in principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from
such acceleration);

(9) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from any of their obligations under their Notes Guarantees
or the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in
this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of holders of the
Notes to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Notes.

233


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision of the Notes
Documents to this “Description of the Notes” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
under any Notes Document, including, without limitation, in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right
or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or make any
change (including changing the ISIN or other identifying number on any Notes) that does not adversely
affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional
Notes that may be issued in compliance with the Indenture;

(7) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants— Additional
_Notes Guarantees,” to add Notes Guarantees with respect to the Notes, including a Note Guarantee by a_
Parent Guarantor and make the related changes to the Indenture by way of Supplemental Indenture
described in the second paragraph of “—Certain Covenants— Additional Notes Guarantees,” to add
security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or
retaking of any Notes Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the Notes when such release,
termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee pursuant to the requirements
thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a Security Interest in favor
of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit Facility, in any
property which is required by the Security Documents or the Revolving Credit Facility (as in effect on the
Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Security Interest is required to be
granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a Security Interest in the Collateral for the
benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such Security Interest is not prohibited by the or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes as
permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of Notes; provided,
_however, that (a) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being transferred_
in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (b) such amendment does not
adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes in any material respect;

(11) to facilitate a Permitted Reorganization or any transaction that complies with the covenants described under
the headings “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” and/or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets;_

(12) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates
and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given
in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.
The Indenture shall not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

234


-----

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by clauses (4) and (7) of the second paragraph of this section “Amendments and Waivers” to add a
Guarantor under the Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the
accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional
Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized
and executed by the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent (to the extent applicable).

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes
Documents (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of
an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate
(other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions_
relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a
payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the
Issuer), the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provisions described
under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its
covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5) (other than with respect to the Issuer),
(6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
_trust”) with the Trustee cash in euro or European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, for the_
payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be,
and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and
at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the
case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Notes and rights of the Trustee, as expressly
provided for in the Indenture) as to all Notes when (a) either (i) all the Notes previously authenticated and
delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee

235


-----

for cancellation; or (ii) all Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (A) have become
due and payable, (B) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (C) are to be called
for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of
redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (b) the Issuer has deposited or caused to
be deposited with the Trustee, money in euro or European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as
applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not previously
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit
(in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case
may be; (c) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (d) the Issuer has
delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the
payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (e) the Issuer has delivered
to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under
the “—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to
matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d)). If requested in writing
by the Issuer to the Trustee, the Trustee shall distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated
Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be, provided however, that the Holders shall have received at
least three Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment date (which may be included in the
notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to holders prior to the maturity
or redemption date as set forth above shall not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break cost
or any additional premium on such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented by a global note deposited
with a depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding interests as a participant of
such clearing system shall be subject to the then applicable procedures of the clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S.
federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee
has written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture.
During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the
Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of
care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer
and its Affiliate, including the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (a) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and
(b) that if the Trustee at any time (i) has or acquires actual knowledge of a conflict of interest that is not
eliminated or (ii) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may
remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any
court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with

236


-----

the acceptance or administration of the Indenture. Each of the Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to
rely solely and conclusively on any Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel in formulating its opinion or in
taking any action (including, without limitation, release of a Guarantee or Collateral) under the Indenture and
may rely on such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel without the need for investigation or verification,
except as may otherwise be provided for in the Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the
rules of the Authority so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be sent to the Authority.

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any Notes
are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream in
accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to
satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed,
such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with
respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given in via Euroclear or Clearstream, it
is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years
after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors, if
any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, if any, including damages. Any amount
received or recovered in a currency other than Euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or
order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by
any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will
only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which
the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of
that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it
is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee, the
Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a
result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and
several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity
provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to
certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it
Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from
the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action,
will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the
indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or
proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Notes Guarantee, or to the
Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro
amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

237


-----

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for permission to be
granted to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application
to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in the Notes
thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and
any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and
state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.
The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor will appoint an agent for service of process in any
suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S.
federal or New York state court located in the City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law
of the Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England. The Security Documents
will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the location of the relevant amount that is part
of the Collateral.

“Affiliate” of any specified Person means any other Person, directly or indirectly, controlling or controlled

equal the rate of interest on such Note in effect on the date on which the applicable notice of
redemption is given; over

(ii) the outstanding principal amount of such Floating Rate Note,

in each case, as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall designate.

determination or approval shall be deemed to have been taken or made if approved by a majority of the directors
(excluding employee representatives, if any) on any such Board of Directors (whether or not such action or
approval is taken as part of a formal board meeting or as a formal board approval). Unless the context requires

“Bund Rate” as selected by the Issuer, means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of direct

from the redemption date to, with respect to the Fixed Rate Notes, April 15, 2023, and, with respect to the
Floating Rate Notes, April 15, 2022, is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Federal
Republic of Germany for which a weekly average yield is given, the Bund Rate shall be obtained by linear

redemption date to, with respect to the Fixed Rate Notes, April 15, 2023, and, with respect to the Floating Rate
Notes, April 15, 2022, is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded direct obligations of the

purposes in the Indenture shall the Bund Rate be less than 0.00%.

applicable) the Election Option, a finance lease or a capitalized lease for financial reporting purposes on the basis
of IAS 17 (Leases) (or any equivalent measure under U.S. GAAP). The amount of Indebtedness will be, at the
time any determination is to be made, the amount of such obligation required to be capitalized on a balance sheet

Stock subsequent to the commencement of the Relevant Testing Period but prior to or simultaneously with the

amalgamations, consolidations and disposed or discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed
charge obligations and the change in LTM EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the

253


-----

Relevant Testing Period. If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was merged or amalgamated with or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the
beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation or disposed or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this
definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such
period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed, ceased
or discontinued operations had occurred at the beginning of the Relevant Testing Period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Issuer (and
may include cost savings, expense reductions and synergies reasonably expected to occur, including from the
result of an acquisition, investment, disposition or ceased or discontinued operations, as though such cost
savings, expense reduction and synergies had been achieved on the first day of the Relevant Testing Period). If
any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such
Indebtedness shall be calculated, at the Issuer’s option, either (x) as if the rate in effect on the determination date
had been the applicable rate for the entire Relevant Testing Period or (y) using the average rate in effect over the
Relevant Testing Period, in each case, taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such
Indebtedness. Interest on a lease (including any Capitalized Lease Obligation) shall be deemed to accrue at an
interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of
interest implicit in such lease in accordance with IFRS. For purposes of making the computation referred to
above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed with a pro forma basis shall be
computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the Relevant Testing Period except
to the extent such revolving credit facility has been permanently repaid and the commitments thereunder
cancelled. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a
prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based
upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate.

“Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum of:

_provided, however, that the term “Guarantee” will not include (a) endorsements for collection or deposit in the_
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice and (b) standard contractual indemnities or product
warranties \ in the ordinary course of business, and provided further that the amount of any Guarantee shall be
deemed to be the lower of (i) an amount equal to the stated or determinable amount of the primary obligation in
respect of which such Guarantee is made and (ii) the maximum amount for which such guaranteeing Person may
be liable pursuant to the terms of the instrument embodying such Guarantee or, if such Guarantee is not an
unconditional guarantee of the entire amount of the primary obligation and such maximum amount is not stated
or determinable, the amount of such guaranteeing Person’s maximum reasonably anticipated liability in respect
thereof as determined by such Person in good faith. The term “Guarantee” used as a verb has a corresponding
meaning.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Notes sold within the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” in reliance on Rule 144A will initially
be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A
Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Note representing the Fixed Rate Notes (the “Fixed
Rate Rule 144A Global Note”) and the Rule 144A Global Note representing the Floating Rate Notes (the
“Floating Rate Rule 144A Global Note”) will be deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name
of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S
Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the
Regulation S Global Note representing the Fixed Rate Notes (the “Fixed Rate Regulation S Global Note” and,
together with the Fixed Rate Rule 144A Global Note, the “Fixed Rate Global Notes”) and the Regulation S
Global Note representing the Floating Rate Notes (the “Floating Rate Regulations S Global Note” and, together
with the Floating Rate Rule 144A Global Note, the “Floating Rate Global Notes”) will be deposited with a
common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (“144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of interests
in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the 144A BookEntry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or
Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on,
and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and/or
Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be issued only in
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account
with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states
of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in
definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.
In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have the Notes
registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form (subject to very
limited exceptions) and will not be considered the registered owners or “holder” of the Notes under the Indenture
for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or
their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the holder of the Notes for all purposes under the
Indenture. As such, participants and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, and, in the case of indirect participants, the participants through which they own
Book-Entry Interests, in order to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Calculation Agent or the
Registrar, nor any of their respective agents, will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records
relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in
registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and
a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

(2) if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default under the Indenture (as defined
therein); or

(3) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

279


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or cause to
be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names of
holders and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes
will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or
applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a
partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the
transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor
or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed; provided that a
Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes
have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee or an
authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the
Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a
Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to
protect us, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them
may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We and/or the Trustee may charge for expenses in
replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, we, in our discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance
with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer
restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Calculation
Agent, the Registrar and any of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any
Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.
Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office
of the Issuer or as otherwise provided in the Indenture, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the
Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear
and Clearstream.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable,
will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the BookEntry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global
Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be
equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of
such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and
Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit
their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or
on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with their respective operational procedures;
_provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount at maturity, may be_
redeemed in part.

280


-----

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent
will, in turn, make such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to
participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent, the Calculation Agent, the Registrar and any of their respective agents will treat the registered
holder of the Global Notes (for example, Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner
thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the
Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, nor any of their respective
agents, has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

   - any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

   - payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest;

   - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

   - the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street
name.”

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of
the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Calculation Agent and the Registrar, nor any of their respective agents,
will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses
in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such
payment. Holders may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to
them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of (i) the Fixed
Rate Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro and
(ii) the Floating Rate Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or
Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of the Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not
exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream
reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to
distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be done in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical

281


-----

delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes
in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of
the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Beneficial interests in a 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt by the
Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such
transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available under
the Securities Act).

For the avoidance of doubt, (i) no Book-Entry Interest in any Fixed Rate Global Note and no Definitive
Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Fixed Rate Global Notes may be transferred
or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in any Floating Rate Global Note or any Definitive Registered Note
issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Floating Rate Global Notes (the “Definitive Registered
Floating Rate Notes”), and (ii) no Book-Entry Interest in the Floating Rate Global Notes and no Definitive
Registered Floating Rate Note may be transferred or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in any Fixed Rate
Global Note or any Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Fixed Rate
Global Notes (the “Definitive Registered Fixed Rate Notes”).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred
and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any Book-Entry Interest
in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest
in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the
first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions
applicable to such notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Calculation Agent or the Registrar, nor any of their respective agents, are
responsible for those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations, and they also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic bookentry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to
others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the Euroclear and Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes
only through Euroclear and Clearstream participants.

282


-----

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange.
Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the
ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent,
the Paying Agent, the Calculation Agent or the Registrar, nor any of their respective agents, will have any
responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered
form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream
holders on the business day following the Issue Date against payment for value on the Issue Date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same
day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading
of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for
business.

In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions
involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who
wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular
day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if
Clearstream is used, or in Brussels if Euroclear is used.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_The information provided below does not purport to be a complete analysis of the tax law and practice_
_currently applicable in Germany and the United States, and does not purport to address the tax consequences_
_applicable to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special rules._

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult with their own tax advisors as to the tax_
_consequences of a purchase of Notes including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and_
_premium paid (if any), and the sale or redemption of the Notes or any interest therein._

_The discussion set forth below is based upon law as in effect on the date of this offering memorandum and is_
_subject to any change in such law that may take effect after such date. Terms defined in the sections below only_
_have such meanings as defined therein for such respective section. The discussion assumes that the Notes will be_
_issued, and any transfers thereof will be made, in accordance with the Indenture._

_The discussion below is a general summary and is not tax advice. It does not cover all tax matters that may_
_be of importance to a particular investor._

**_Each prospective investor is urged to consult its own tax advisor about the federal, state, local and foreign tax_**
**_consequences relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes in light of the investor’s own_**
**_circumstances._**

**Certain German Tax Considerations**

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and
disposal of the Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that
may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or
circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany
currently in force and as applied on the date of this offering memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly
with retroactive or retrospective effect.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences
of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, including the effect of any state or local or church taxes
under the tax laws of Germany and any country of which they are residents or whose tax laws apply to them for
other reasons.

**_Withholding Tax_**

Ongoing interest payments received by an individual holder of the Notes who is a German tax resident
(meaning, persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective management and control
is located in Germany) will be subject to German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) if the Notes are held in
custody with or administered by or presented for an over-the-counter payment to (i) a German branch of a
German or non-German bank or financial services institution, (ii) a German securities trading company, (iii) a
German securities trading bank (each, a “Disbursing Agent”, auszahlende Stelle), or (iv)—if no German bank or
financial services institution is the Disbursing Agent—the Issuer. The withholding tax rate to be withheld by the
Disbursing Agent is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being
26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable). Church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of
withholding unless the holder has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax
Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) in which case the holders will have to include the income in the tax return
and will then be assessed for church tax.

The same treatment applies to capital gains (meaning, the difference between the proceeds from the
disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition taking into account currency gains and losses, if
any) and interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued Interest”, Stückzinsen) derived by an individual holder who is a
German tax resident irrespective of any holding period provided that the Notes have been held in a custodial
account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. If interest coupons or interest claims
are disposed of separately (meaning, without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to
withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the redemption of interest coupons or the payment of interest
claims if the Notes have been disposed of separately.

To the extent that the Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same
Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment
withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding

284


-----

being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any),
unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes
by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution within the
European Union, the European Economic Area or the countries/territories, the Swiss Confederation, the
Principality of Liechtenstein, the Republic of San Marino, the Principality of Monaco, the Principality of
Andorra, Curacao and Sint Maarten. If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment
of the Notes has been calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a
German tax resident individual holder may also apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition
costs; however, in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds a German tax resident
individual holder is obliged to apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs.

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of the
withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the Disbursing
Agent (for example, losses from the sale of other capital investments (Kapitalvermögen) with the exception of
shares). The Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest on the Notes or other capital investments paid
separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain
requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on investment
income in a given year regarding capital investments held by the individual holder in the custodial account with
the Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent,
the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married
couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene
_Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld from the_
gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the
Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung)
issued by the competent tax authorities.

German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German tax resident (including via a commercial
partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of
corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax authorities) while ongoing payments, such
as interest payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses
incurred). The same may apply where the Notes form part of a trade or business (of an individual or of a
commercial partnership) subject to further requirements being met.

Non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax on investment income and
the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German taxation (as
outlined below under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non-Tax Residents”) and the Notes are
held in a custodial account with a Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain circumstances.
The withholding tax may be refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable tax treaty
(Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

**_Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains_**

_Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Tax Residents” refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (meaning, persons
whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is located in
Germany).

Income derived from capital investments under the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident in
Germany is in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and
church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment
(Privatvermögen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual
allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the
registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually
incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income from
capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described under
“—Withholding Tax” above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of Notes

285


-----

kept in custody abroad or if no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process or if the withholding tax
on disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather
than the actual gain), the individual holder must include its interest income and capital gains derived from the
Notes in its annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where
applicable, church tax thereon). Further, an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment income
of a given year at its lower individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld
being refunded. In each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not
permitted. Losses incurred with respect to the Notes may only be offset with investment income of the individual
holder realized in the same or following assessment periods.

Pursuant to recent legislative changes, losses arising from a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall), a waiver of a
receivable (Forderungsverzicht) or a transfer of an impaired receivable to a third party or from any other default
can only be offset against other income from capital investments and only up to an amount of €20,000 per year.
Respective losses exceeding the amount of €20.000 can be carried forward and might be usable in future tax
periods (together with current capital investment losses of each such tax period) up to an amount of €20.000 per
year.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or the income from the
Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the
personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax
(plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part of a trade or business,
interest (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective
holder must include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed
at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the
personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate
income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and
gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade
tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz).
If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely
or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

_Non-Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Non-Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (meaning,
persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management and control is not
located in Germany).

Interest and capital gains (which include Accrued Interest and currency gains and losses, if any) from the
disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax-resident in
Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of
a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the
holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income (such as income from the letting and
leasing of certain German-situs real estate or income from capital investments directly or indirectly secured by
German-situs real estate, unless the Notes qualify as global certificate (Sammelurkunde) within the meaning of
Section 9a of the German Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue
(Teilschuldverschreibungen)). In cases (i) and (ii) a tax regime similar to that explained above under “—Tax
Residents” applies. Furthermore, the holders who are not tax resident in Germany may become subject to
German withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of an over-the-counter payment by a
Disbursing Agent and the Notes are not held in custody with the same Disbursing Agent. Subject to certain
requirements a holder who is not tax-resident in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions
provided by an applicable double taxation treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

**_Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge_**

According to a bill enacted in December 2019, the solidarity surcharge has been partially abolished as of the
assessment period 2021 for certain individuals. The solidarity surcharge, however, continues to apply for capital
investments and, thus, on withholding taxes levied. In case the individual income tax burden for an individual
holder is lower than 25% the holder can apply for his/her capital investment income being assessed at his/her
individual tariff-based income tax rate in which case solidarity surcharge would be refunded.

286


-----

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or gift
tax if the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the transfer a resident or
deemed to be a resident of Germany. If neither the holder nor the recipient is a resident or deemed to be a
resident of Germany at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or gift taxes will be levied unless (i) the
Notes are attributable to a German trade or business for which a permanent establishment is maintained or a
permanent representative has been appointed in Germany or (ii) the obligations under the Notes are directly or
indirectly secured by German-situs real estate (unless the Notes qualify as fungible notes representing the same
issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen)). Exceptions from this rule apply to certain German citizens who previously
maintained a residence in Germany.

**_Other Taxes_**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or such duties will be payable in Germany in connection with the
issuance, delivery or execution of the Notes. Currently, net assets tax (Vermögensteuer) is not levied in Germany.

**_The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax_**

The EU Commission and certain EU member states (including Germany) are currently intending to
introduce a financial transaction tax (presumably on secondary market transactions involving at least one
financial intermediary). The timing of its potential introduction is, however, still unclear. Prospective holders of
the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the financial transaction tax.

**_Proposed Abolishment of German Flat Tax on Interest Income_**

The coalition agreement between the German Christian Democratic Party and the German Social
Democratic Party dated 7 February 2018 provides that the current flat taxation (Abgeltungsteuer) of 25% (plus
solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if
applicable) on interest income shall be partially abolished. As a result, interest on the Notes could become
subject to a taxation at a respective Note holder’s individual personal tax rate—where such holder of the Notes is
a tax resident of Germany—up to a tax rate of 45% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total
withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable, should then be creditable).

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects.
The discussion is limited to considerations relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined below) and does not address the
effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or
any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.

This discussion is based upon the federal income tax laws of the United States, including the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and
administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to
differing interpretations and change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect which could significantly affect
the U.S. federal tax consequences described below. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance
that the IRS or a court will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership or disposition of the Notes than those discussed herein or that any such position would not be
sustained in the event of litigation. A different treatment than that assumed below could adversely affect the
amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Notes.

This discussion is general in nature and does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations
that may be relevant to a U.S. Holder in light of such U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances or status, including
the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax, FATCA (generally, Sections 1471 through 1474 of
the Code, the Treasury regulations and any administrative guidance issued thereunder, and any laws relating to
an intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection therewith), the alternative minimum tax, or the base
erosion and anti-abuse tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as banks, certain financial institutions,
persons who have ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States and other U.S.
expatriates, insurance companies, retirement plans, individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, brokers

or dealers in securities or currencies, traders that elect to mark their securities to market, U.S. Holders whose
functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate
investment trusts, partnerships, S corporations, or other pass through entities and investors in such entities,
entities covered by the U.S. anti-inversion rules, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal
income tax, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other
integrated transaction, persons that purchase or sell the Notes as part of a wash sale for tax purposes, persons who
own, actually or under applicable constructive ownership rules, 10% or more of our ordinary shares, any person
acquiring the Notes in connection with the performance of services, and persons subject to special tax accounting
rules as a result of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial
statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and
at their “issue price” (meaning, the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to investors for
cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of
underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets (generally, property held
for investment) within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or any
other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of
the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to
U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) a trust if it is subject to the primary supervision of a
court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions
of the trust, or if the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a
U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes,
the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partner and the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in
such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

The discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations set forth below is for general information
purposes only. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax
consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S.
federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of other federal, state, local or other
non-U.S. tax laws.

**_Additional Payments_**

In certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld
or deducted from payments on the Notes or make payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal and
interest. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of paying
such additional amounts or payments does not result in the Notes being treated as “contingent payment debt
instruments” under the applicable Treasury regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination
that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the possibility that such additional amounts or payments will
have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations.

Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. Holder,
unless the U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which such U.S. Holder
acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the
IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue interest income on
its Notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate and any otherwise applicable OID, to treat as ordinary
income, rather than capital gain, some or all of any gain recognized on the taxable disposition of the Notes, and
to recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to such income. In the event a contingency
occurs, the amount, timing and character of a U.S. Holder’s income, gain or loss with respect to the Notes may be
affected. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated
as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be
treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Payments of Interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, the gross amount of interest on a Note (which
includes any foreign tax withheld) will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or
accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for tax purposes.

If you receive a payment of interest on a Note denominated in euro and you use the cash method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income)
the U.S. dollar value of the interest received on the Notes, determined by translating the euro received at the spot
rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.
You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may recognize
exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros so received.

If you receive a payment of interest on a Note denominated in euro and you use the accrual method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or you are otherwise required to accrue interest prior to
receipt), you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to interest received on the Notes in
accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income for
each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued during such year, determined by
translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest
accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period
within the taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate on:

   - the last day of the accrual period;

   - the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the applicable taxable year if the accrual period
straddles your taxable year; or

   - the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of
the accrual period.

This election will apply to all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without the
consent of the IRS. You should consult your own tax advisor as to the advisability of making the above election.

Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Note denominated in euro
(including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but
unpaid interest previously included in income), you will recognize U.S. source ordinary income or loss in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating
the euros received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest
income you previously included in income with respect to such payment. This exchange gain or loss will not be
treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

If the Notes are issued at an “issue price” (as defined above) which is less than the stated redemption price
at maturity such Notes will be considered to have been issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes unless the difference is less than a de minimis threshold (generally equal to 1/4 of
1% of the Notes’ stated principal amount multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from their
“issue date”). The “issue date” is the first date upon which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for cash to
persons other than bondhouses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters,
placement agents, or wholesalers.

If the Notes are issued with OID, a U.S. Holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer) generally will
be required to include in gross income (as ordinary income) any OID as it accrues on a constant yield to maturity
basis, before the holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to this income. Subject to the foreign currency
rules discussed below, the amount of OID, if any, includible in gross income for a taxable year will be the sum of
the daily portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during that taxable year on which the U.S. Holder
holds the Note. Generally, the daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in an “accrual period” a pro
rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The OID allocable to any accrual period will generally
equal the excess, if any, of (a) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the Note as of the beginning of such
accrual period and the Note’s “yield to maturity” (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each
accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period) over (b) the aggregate of all stated
interest allocable to the accrual period. The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is
unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the Issuer), or that is treated as

289


-----

constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate or, under certain circumstances, at a variable rate.
Stated interest on the Notes should be treated as qualified stated interest. In general, the “adjusted issue price” of
a Note at the beginning of the first accrual period is its issue price and, on any day thereafter, is the sum of the
issue price and the amount of OID previously includible in the gross income of any U.S. Holder, reduced by the
amount of any payment (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) previously made on the Note.

Since the Floating Rate Notes bear a floating rate of stated interest, both the “yield to maturity” and the
amount of stated interest in each accrual period will be determined, solely for purposes of calculating the accrual
of OID, as though the Floating Rate Note will bear stated interest in all periods at a fixed rate generally equal to
the rate that would be applicable to stated interest payments on such Floating Rate Note on its date of issue. To
the extent the stated interest actually accrued or paid during an accrual period exceeds (or is less than) the stated
interest to be accrued or paid during the accrual period based on such fixed rate on the date of issue, such
difference will be accounted for United States federal income tax purposes as an adjustment to stated interest and
will have no effect on the computation of OID.

OID will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into United States
dollars in the same manner as stated interest income accrued by a holder on the accrual basis, as described above.
You will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of
proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference
between the United States dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the foreign currency received
at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID (determined in
the same manner as for accrued interest). Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or
loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income
or expense. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed: first, as the receipt of any stated interest
payments called for under the terms of the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent
thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as the receipt of
principal.

A U.S. Holder may irrevocably elect, subject to certain limitations, to treat all interest on any Note as OID
and calculate the amount includible in gross income under the method described above. The election is to be
made for the taxable year in which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note and may not be revoked without the
consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about this election.

The rules regarding OID are complex and the rules described above may not apply in all cases. Accordingly,
you should consult your tax advisors regarding their application.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such
disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest not previously included in income, which
will be taxable as such) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note, in each case as determined in U.S.
dollars. If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign
currency received (with such U.S. dollar value based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition). In
the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder
and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by
translating such amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to
accrual basis U.S. Holders in regard to the sale or other disposition of Notes traded on an established securities
market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and cannot be changed
without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not elect to determine the amount realized
using the spot exchange rate on the settlement date will recognize foreign currency gain or loss equal to the
difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount received based on the spot exchange rates in effect on the
date of the sale or other disposition and the settlement date.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the amount paid for such Note by such U.S.
Holder, increased by previously accrued OID, if any. If a U.S. Holder uses foreign currency to purchase a Note,
the amount paid for the Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price
determined at the spot rate on the date of purchase. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an
established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it makes the special election described in the
preceding paragraph, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency
purchase price at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase.

290


-----

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of
a Note generally will be capital gain or loss and, except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency gain
or loss, generally will be long term capital gain or loss so long as the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than
one year on the date of disposition. Long term capital gains of certain non-corporate U.S. Holders (including
individuals) are generally eligible for preferential tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the
Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such
Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss and not be treated as interest income or expense. For
these purposes, the “principal amount” of a Note is the U.S. Holder’s foreign currency purchase price of the
Note. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of
such Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of
the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder disposes of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar
value of the principal amount of the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder purchased such
Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S.
Holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid
stated interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” or “—Original
_Issue Discount,” as applicable. However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable_
disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will realize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with
respect to principal amount and accrued and unpaid stated interest and, if any, OID) only to the extent of total
gain or loss realized by such U.S. Holder on such disposition.

**_Source of Income and Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest income and OID, if any, on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and
generally will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S.
Holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note and any gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency
exchange rates generally will be treated as U.S. source. There are significant complex limitations on a U.S.
Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. The rules governing the calculation of foreign tax credits are
complex and depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors
regarding the creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury regulations issued under the Code provisions meant to require the reporting to the IRS of certain
tax shelter transactions cover certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign
currency transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual
of interest or OID or a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or
foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to
determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any
requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

Individuals and certain entities that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value
exceeding certain threshold amounts, generally are required to file an information report with respect to such
assets with their tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these
reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and interest (and the
accrual of OID, if any) on the Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or
redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. Holder unless such U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient (such as a
corporation), and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption. The payor generally will be required to
impose backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, on such payments if the U.S. Holder fails to furnish an
accurate taxpayer identification number and otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding or if
certain other conditions apply. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Payment by a Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor, including any Guarantor organized in Poland, makes any payments in respect of (or that are
classified as) interest on the Notes, it is possible that such payments may be subject to withholding tax at
applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation
treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. It is not certain that such payments by the Guarantor will be
eligible for exemption from withholding

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS**

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in the jurisdictions in which the Issuer,_
_the Guarantors and certain subsidiaries are incorporated or organized, and a summary of certain limitations on_
_the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests for the Notes and the Note_
_Guarantees. The description is only a summary and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all of the_
_limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes and the Notes_
_Guarantees and the security interests. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors_
_with respect to such limitations and considerations._

**European Union**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated in Germany and Poland, which are Member States of the
European Union.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), and starting from June 26, 2017,
which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the court which shall have jurisdiction to
commence main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company organized under the laws of a Member State is
the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main
interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where a
company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member
States may have differing and even conflicting views.

The “centre of main interests” is not a static concept. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under
Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its “centre of main interests” in the Member
State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary (which presumption shall not
apply if the registered office has been moved to another Member State within the three month period prior to the
request for the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1), second sentence, of the EU Insolvency
Regulation states that the “centre of main interests” shall be the place where the debtor conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and “which is ascertainable by third parties.” The courts have
taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the “centre of main interests” of a company in that
respect, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the
majority of its business or has its head office, and the location where the large majority of the company’s
creditors are established.

If the centre of main interests of a company is and will remain located in a Member State in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency
Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be
entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency
Regulation. Insolvency proceedings initiated in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are
automatically recognized in the Member States (other than Denmark), although territorial (secondary) insolvency
proceedings may be commenced in another Member State.

If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article
3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have
jurisdiction to open territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company
has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in
the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a
company carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior to the request to open main insolvency
proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of
territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings in another Member State will also be possible if the debtor had an
establishment in such Member State in the three month period prior to the request for commencement of main
insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where the debtor carries
out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings a
non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.”

The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of
the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the
debtor has its “centre of main interests” have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU

293


-----

Insolvency Regulation, territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another
Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be
commenced in the Member State in which the company’s “centre of main interests” is situated under that
Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of
(i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within
the territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial (secondary) proceedings is requested or
(ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the
establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial insolvency
proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the
local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.
Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the
territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have
jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them,
such as avoidance actions.

The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall
not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or
immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to
time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the
opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include:

   - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of
or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

   - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim
or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

   - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of
them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled;

   - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no
secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a
Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there)
may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to
remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency
proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to
the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the
debtor has assets.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court
of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member State in which the
main proceedings are located in another Member State as long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in
such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to
open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State. It may, in particular, subject to the preservation of
third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of the
sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove
assets of the company from that other Member State.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another
Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which
secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds
received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply
under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State.
Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local
creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking
is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall,
at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings
if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

294


-----

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its
creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months,
provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of
realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to
the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods.
Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in
the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the
secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

The EU Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by
the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order
to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of the group’s members. The EU
Insolvency Regulations provides

(i) for cooperation between (i) insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the
secondary insolvency proceedings, (ii) jurisdictions and (iii) jurisdictions and insolvency practitioners;

(ii) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient
administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same
group;

(iii) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and

(iv) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such
insolvency registers.

EU directive on preventative restructuring frameworks

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency
of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU)
2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was published on
June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs
that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable
them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit
from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and
(iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in
particular with a view to shortening their length.

The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring,
insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive
restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to
promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage,
when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most
notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual
enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation,
(b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of
interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c)
creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75%
of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of
affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may,
under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do
not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be
confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of
creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of
the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may
also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring.

The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by
July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for
which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024 or, in others, on
July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period for Member States
encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in
which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of
such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and
some of the Guarantors. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the
respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and
there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in
relation to one another.

**Germany**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered
offices in Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. In the event of an insolvency of
the Issuer or a Guarantor organized under the laws of Germany and/or having its “centre of main interests” in
Germany (each a “German Guarantor” and collectively, the “German Guarantors”) at the time the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, any main insolvency proceedings would
most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. Under certain
circumstances, insolvency proceedings over certain assets of the Issuer and/or a German Guarantor may be
opened in other jurisdictions, in particular if such assets are located in another Member State of the European
Union. With respect to cross-border group insolvencies, Art 56 et seq. Recast Insolvency Regulation introduced
requirements facilitating communication and cooperation between the administrators and courts involved. In
addition, a coordination procedure may be initiated, which involves the appointment of a coordinator and the
adoption of a cross-border coordination plan. —See “—European Union.”

The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) or the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG), may not be as favorable to
your interests as creditors than the insolvency laws of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you
may be familiar, including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as
well as, in certain circumstances, priority recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency
proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the
limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

**_Insolvency_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the proceedings under the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung):

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court
_ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings._
Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over indebtedness
(Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of its illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that the debtor is
unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall due for a period longer than three weeks. According
to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over indebted when its
liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s
business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) based on a 12 months’
forecast horizon (positive Fortführungsprognose). If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter
_Haftung), a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in_
Germany (Societas Europaea) or any other company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or
partner finds itself in a situation of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or over indebtedness (Überschuldung),
each managing director of such company and, in certain circumstances, its shareholders or members of the
supervisory board, are obligated to file for insolvency without undue delay but not later than three weeks after
such illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or six weeks after such over indebtedness (Überschuldung) occurred
or (as the case may be) was established. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both
severe damages claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors,
can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings or for restructuring proceedings (see “—Preventive

296


-----

_Restructuring Framework”) in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the_
imminent risk of the company being unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due at some point in time
within a prognosis period of usually 24 months, whereas imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit)
does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings.

The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in
the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020 (as amended
from time to time, the “COVInsAG”), provides, inter alia, for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency
due to over-indebtedness until, currently, April 30, 2021. The suspension—as in force from January 1, 2021—
applies to debtors who, in the period from November 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021, have applied for financial
assistance under state assistance programs to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, unless the
insolvency is not caused by consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and there is obviously no prospect of
obtaining the state financial assistance or the assistance that can be obtained is insufficient to eliminate the overindebtedness.

A company may also file for preliminary “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung),
if, in general, the company has developed a comprehensive and conclusive turn-around plan to be implemented
by way of debtor-in-possession proceedings and the insolvency court is not aware of any circumstances that
indicate that key aspects of the filed turn-around plan are based on incorrect assumptions. If a company faces
imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or is over-indebted (überschuldet), but not illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig), it may also file for preliminary “debtor in possession” protective shield proceedings
(Schutzschirmverfahren), unless—from a third party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a successful
restructuring. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger
_Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets). It may also_
implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three
months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which ideally shall be implemented in
formal “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been
opened. During the period of either the preliminary debtor-in-possession proceedings (vorläufige
_Eigenverwaltung) or the protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren), the debtor shall prepare an_
insolvency plan which ideally shall be implemented in formal “debtor-in-possession” proceedings
(Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened.

The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). In particular, the insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken
to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings (other than with
respect to immoveable assets) or, to the extent required to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business,
prohibit the enforcement of any collateral granted over claims, rights or other movable assets of debtor. If the
enforcement of collateral is prohibited by the insolvency court, secured creditors have to be adequately
compensated by the insolvency estate.

Unless the debtor has applied for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the
court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the
management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary trustee or
preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary
administrator or the preliminary trustee depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary
administrator or preliminary trustee may include safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing
whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings.
Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets of the
debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator, whilst in “debtor-in-possession” proceedings, the
debtor’s management retains the right to manage business. However, the court may also order that certain
disposals of the debtor may require the preliminary trustee’s consent also in “debtor-in-possession” proceedings.
The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the debtor.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary creditors’
committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three
requirements:

(i) a balance sheet total of at least €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over
indebted);

297


-----

(ii) revenue of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year
preceding the filing; and/or

(iii) fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis (including, inter alios, part time employees).

The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the
preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the selection
of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) / preliminary trustee (vorläufiger
Sachwalter) and an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) / trustee (Sachwalter); and court orders for
“debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung).

The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal
requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has been
filed by the debtor), illiquidity and/or over indebtedness and (ii) if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the
cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient to cover such
costs, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors), advance
the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Unless the court has granted “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court
will only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor), upon
opening of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter)
who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer
entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to change the
individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste
_Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount_
of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and
(ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and
impartial. Individual creditors, or the debtor, can request the insolvency court to remove the insolvency
administrator only on the grounds of a lack of impartiality and only within six months from the appointment. The
insolvency administrator (or in the case of “debtor in possession proceedings”, the debtor) may raise new
financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these
liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any unsecured
insolvency liabilities created by the debtor including, e.g., the Notes Guarantees. Residual claims of a secured
insolvency creditors remaining after realization of the respective collateral (if any) also qualify as unsecured
insolvency claim in this regard. However, in “debtor-in-possession” proceedings, the debtor shall only incur
estate liabilities in the ordinary course of business without the trustee’s (Sachwalter) consent.

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time
unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

The insolvency administrator (or trustee in case of “debtor-in-possession proceedings”) may also challenge
transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of
the insolvency proceedings (See “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer”).

For the holders of the Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency proceedings against the
Issuer or any German Guarantor would include, among possible voidance actions and other things, the following:

(i) unless the court orders “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer
and dispose of the Issuer’s or German Guarantor’s assets would generally pass to the insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

(ii) unless the court orders “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by
the Issuer’s or German Guarantor’s management after the opening of insolvency proceedings are null
and void by operation of law;

(iii) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a
creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest
in part of the relevant insolvency debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency
estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency
proceedings;

298


-----

(iv) claims against the relevant debtor may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth
in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

(v) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e. the relevant asset of this person does not
constitute a part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim
for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency
administrator.

Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the
insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency and restructuring law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape
clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement,
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or
restructuring proceedings or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency or restructuring
proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid in case of insolvency
proceedings such clause would frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to
perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless such clause only reflects termination rights
applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors (Massegläubiger) as opposed to a preferential
right (Absonderungsrecht)), who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency
proceedings and have to file their claims against the debtor and the rights they claim in the assets of the debtor
with the insolvency administrator. With the exception of certain secured creditors, an individual enforcement
action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency
proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition
is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). German insolvency proceedings are collective
proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings
separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). Accordingly, also unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings
and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available).
Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security interests after insolvency proceedings have
been commenced to the extent the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency
administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral but have only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte)
in the insolvency proceedings. In this case, secured creditors will only have a right to claim the recoveries (minus
costs and fees) from such realization. Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a secured
creditor remains entitled to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security:
The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets within its possession
that are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights
(Mobiliarpfandrechte), transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) and (ii) to collect any claims that
are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). According to some voices in legal
literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect
of pledged uncertificated shares on their own or, insofar as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate,
whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the
secured creditors. However, there is no authoritative case law on this question. That having been said, the
German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) views the insolvency administrator competent to realize
pledged shares in a corporation that have been certificated (verbrieft) and are hold in a custodian account (Depot)
in Germany in case the shares represent more than 20% in the issued share capital of the pledged company. It
therefore appears likely that in this particular case, secured creditors would not be held competent to realize the
respective share pledges.

Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator,
the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds
(Ersatzabsonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges of 9%
(or as agreed upon individually, but in any case at least 4%) for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets and
(ii) realizing the secured assets are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to
an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts (“excess proceeds”) will be allocated to the
insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) (being the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor) and would, after
deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (e.g., fees for and expenses of the preliminary insolvency

299


-----

administrator, the insolvency administrator and the insolvency court as well as the members of the (preliminary)
creditors’ committee) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the
non-preferential unsecured creditors, including the holders of the Notes (to the extent not satisfied after
enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes). If the Issuer or a German Guarantor or a subsidiary thereof
subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the
Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of creditors secured by such security (however, the
preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the disposal of the relevant collateral).
The excess proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the
Notes by the Issuer or the German Guarantors after such secured creditors have been satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator,
however, must compensate the creditor in accordance with specific rules. In addition, it may take several years
before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are distributed to unsecured creditors. A
different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be
submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator or, in “debtor-in-possession proceedings”, by the trustee
(upon instruction of the preliminary creditors’ committee or the creditors’ meeting) and which requires, in
principle, the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific
majority rules. The insolvency court may order the deemed approval of one or more opposing creditor groups
under certain conditions (cram down). The insolvency plan may derogate from the provisions of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In particular, it may contain provisions regarding the discharge of secured
and unsecured creditors, the disposal of the insolvency estate as well as procedure. It may also create, modify,
transfer or terminate rights in rem such as property rights or security interests. If the debtor is a corporate entity,
the shares or, as the case may be, the partnership interests in the debtor can also be included in the insolvency
plan, including an issuance of shares or partnership interests to third parties or to creditors based on a
debt-to-equity swap. Thus, an insolvency plan could under certain circumstances provide for provisions, inter
_alia, regarding the Notes or the Notes Guarantees or the Collateral which are less favorable to the holders of the_
Notes than the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), such as the release of the
Collateral or the release of obligations under the Notes or the Notes Guarantees. Under certain conditions, such
provisions could be adopted against the votes of the affected holders of the Notes. However, it will not be
possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt-for-equity swap
under the proposed insolvency plan.

An insolvency plan can further provide for the release or other impairment of guarantees or other security
interests provided by debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten), without such debtor affiliates being
required to become subject of the debtor’s or separate insolvency proceedings, provided that the relevant debtor
affiliate consents to the impairment. Creditors affected by such impairment are entitled to receive adequate
compensation. This means that the claims under the Notes Guarantees can get impaired if the Issuer would enter
into German insolvency proceedings, regardless of whether or not the relevant German Guarantor is itself subject
of insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies
in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of
view, has to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the
respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately.
However, the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) has provisions to facilitate the coordination of and
cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. Whereas these provisions do not provide for a
consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets
and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, they
stipulate four key measures in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single
court may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppengerichtsstand); (ii) a
single person may be appointed as insolvency administrator for all relevant group companies; (iii) certain
coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees,
and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment
of a “coordinator” (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan)
for approval by the coordination court (Koordinationsgericht).

As a general principle, the claims arising from the Notes or a Notes Guarantee may be enforced against the
Issuer or a German Guarantor outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Issuer or the relevant
German Guarantor, as applicable. Any insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Issuer would, however, be a

300


-----

rather strong indication that the overall financial situation of the entire group of affiliated companies has
significantly deteriorated, which may cause a German Guarantor to subsequently file for insolvency.

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law (including,
but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of
repayment of shareholder loans or comparable actions, but except for government developments banks and its
affiliates). The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the Indentures may result in the holders of
the Notes and/or the applicable Trustee being considered in a “shareholder like” position (gesellschafterähnliche
_Stellung). In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of the Issuer or a German Guarantor, the_
claims arising from the Notes or a Notes Guarantee would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim
(nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen). Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the
insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Issuer or a German Guarantor unless the insolvency court handling
the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not
granted in the vast majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. Claims of a person who becomes a
creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to claims
of regular, unsecured creditors. Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal
relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts
become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or, in the event that
“debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) have been granted, the trustee (Sachwalter) may also
challenge (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency
creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings during applicable voidance
periods. The administrator’s or the trustee’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances,
extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of
insolvency proceedings.

In the event of insolvency proceedings based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the
payment of any amounts to the holders of Notes as well as the granting of collateral for or providing credit
support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or, as
the case may be, a trustee under the rules of avoidance as set forth in the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). If the validity or enforceability of the Notes, the respective Notes Guarantees or any
Collateral in favor of the Notes is challenged successfully, the holder of the Notes may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees or the relevant Collateral. If payments have already been made
under the Notes, the Notes Guarantee or Collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been
challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. In this case, holders of the Notes would only have a
general unsecured claim under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the
granting of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases:

(i) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (a) during the
last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, if
the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such
illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig))
at such time, or (b) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the
creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or the filing of such petition (or of
circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or filing); whereby in
each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) as described below shall be presumed to have
been aware of the debtor’s insolvency or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings;

(ii) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not
entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such creditor was not
entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (a) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing
of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (b) such act was
taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) at such time or (c) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the

301


-----

filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such
act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of
circumstances that imperatively suggest such detrimental effect); whereby in each case an “affiliated
party” (nahestehende Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the
detrimental nature of such transaction for other creditors;

(iii) any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the
debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is
obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (a) during the three months prior to the
filing of the petition of the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the
illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at such time or (b) after the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the
debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or such filing at the time of the transaction (or of
circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or filing); whereby in
each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) as described below shall be presumed to have
been aware of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or of the filing to open insolvency
proceedings;

(iv) any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security
(including a guarantee) for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted
gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings;

(v) any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to prejudice the
insolvency creditors if the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act with such
knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was at least imminent
(drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors. For granting
an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security or satisfaction to which
such creditor was entitled, such knowledge is (solely) presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor
was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) (as opposed to the knowledge of imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in regular cases) and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors. Apart_
from that, such acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain
security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) (whether or not it was granted or obtained in a form
or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction), may only
be avoided if they were effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or at a time after the filing. There is a rebuttable
presumption that, if the debtor reached a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with the creditor
or the creditor granted any other form of deferred payment (Zahlungserleichterungen) to the debtor, he
had no knowledge of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at the time of the transaction;

(vi) any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and an “affiliated
party” (nahestehende Person), as described below, which directly operates to the detriment of the
creditors can be challenged unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing
of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the
debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded;

(vii) any act that grants security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a
claim under a shareholder loan granted to the debtor or an equivalent claim if (a) in the case of the
granting of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (b) in the case of
satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. This does not apply (a) to shareholders that
own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not engaged in management and (b) until the
sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige Sanierung) of the debtor in case a creditor for the first time
acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity with the intension to
restructure the debtor; and

(viii) any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction to a third party for a loan claim or an equivalent claim if
(a) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of
insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (b) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security for such

302


-----

loan or was liable as a guarantor or surety provider (Garant oder Bürge) for such loan (in which case
the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which
the conclusion must be drawn that, e.g., the debtor (e.g., a German Guarantor) was unable to pay its debts
generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act
was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. Knowledge of pending
restructuring proceedings (see—“Preventive Restructuring Framework”) per se does not suffice for a creditor to
be deemed to have such “knowledge.” A person is further deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to
prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction
prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If the relevant act granted an insolvency creditor, or enabled an insolvency
creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form in which
and at a time at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction (kongruente Deckungshandlung),
the words “imminent illiquidity” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the preceding sentence have to be replaced
by “actual illiquidity” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). With respect to an “affiliated party” (nahestehende
_Person) as described below there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge” as indicated_
above.

In relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) includes, subject to
certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning
more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them
access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or
members of the household of any of the foregoing persons.

The granting of a security concurrently with the incurrence of debt funded as new money may be qualified
as a “cash transaction” and may as such be privileged. Meaning, under certain circumstances it may not be
subject to avoidance rights under the German Insolvency Code (Bargeschäftsprivileg). According to recent case
law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), however, this privilege does not apply to claims
as described under (vii) above.

Any kind of newly granted third-party financing (i.e., not only traditional cash loans but also commercial
credits and other forms of financing) and respective collateral as well as shareholder loans under German
insolvency law avoidance provisions, which have been granted from March 1, 2020 until September 30, 2020 are
privileged under German insolvency law due to the CovInsAG. Thus, the repayment (including reasonable
interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered
disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020
(in certain cases, if the debtor fulfilled the respective requirements for a further suspension of the filing duties at
the time, until December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021). Loans granted, and security taken, by certain public
institutions as part of COVID-19 subsidies remain privileged even if granted or taken after that period. The
general privilege also includes the provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but does not
apply in case of the provision of collateral in favor of a shareholder loan or receivables from economically
similar acts.

Furthermore, any transactions contemplated by a restructuring plan (see—“Preventive Restructuring
_Framework”) are not subject to avoidance actions until a sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige Sanierung) of the_
debtor is achieved, unless the restructuring plan was based on incorrect or incomplete information presented by
the debtor and the addressee of the avoidance action had knowledge thereof. This privilege does not apply to
shareholder loans or economically similar transactions or collateral provided therefor.

Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the
insolvency estate. In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing
funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable towards another creditor if (i) such creditor
was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending)
insolvency (for which knowledge of pendent restructuring proceedings (see—“Preventive Restructuring
_Framework”) per se does not suffice) at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was_
granted and (ii) the other creditor suffered losses caused by a delayed filing for insolvency based on the
additional or extended existing funding. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this
could be the case if, e.g., the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the
other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention
could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as
the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further

303


-----

with respect thereto. If, however, such was additional funding has been provided or existing funding has been
extended or respective collateral has been granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (in certain
cases, until December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021), any such transaction is statutorily exempted from the lender
liability concept as laid out above.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the
debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking
below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their
amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency
creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency
creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and
administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding
the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for
restitution of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions
corresponding in economic terms to such a loan. However, the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and
receivables from economically similar acts is suspended in insolvency proceedings applied for up until
September 30, 2023 for newly granted shareholder loans granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30,
2020 (in certain cases, if the debtor fulfilled the respective requirements for a further suspension of the filing
duties at the time, until December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021).

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization
and Restructuring Act (StaRUG).

Based on the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on
preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the
efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive
(EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “Restructuring Directive”) the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has come into force on January 1, 2021. The Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a new pre-insolvency procedure to restructure the liabilities of
debtors, whose “centre of main interest” is located in Germany. This may apply to the German Guarantors as
well as to the Issuer.

As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1,
2021, no corresponding (court) practice exists as of the date of this offering memorandum and consequently any
proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) come with uncertainty.

For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of an initiation of restructuring proceedings
by a German Guarantor or any other Guarantor having its centre of main interest in Germany would be in
particular the following:

   - potentially no or limited court review and/or supervision of the restructuring proceedings;

   - any measures (such as reduction in principal and/or interest or deferrals) regulated by the restructuring
plan may be approved within a class of creditors (e.g., the holders of the Notes) with a majority of 75%
of the claims or by way of a so-called cross-class cram down by other classes under certain
presumptions;

   - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to restructuring
proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and

   - restrictions on individual enforcement actions for all or certain creditors regarding their claims, or, if
applicable, their respective collateral over moveable assets of up to eight months due to a moratorium.

**_Restructuring proceedings_**

Restructuring proceedings may only be initiated by the relevant debtor with a notification of the competent
restructuring court of the commencement of restructuring proceedings. A debtor is eligible to file for
restructuring proceedings if it has become imminently illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig). Such imminent

304


-----

illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) occurs if it is more likely than not that the debtor will be unable to
pay its debts as and when they fall due within a two years’ look-forward period.

During the restructuring proceedings, the debtor has to observe the duty of a prudent business manager,
which includes safeguarding the best interest of all of the debtor’s creditors. In particular, the debtor has to
refrain from any actions, which cannot be reconciled with or potentially frustrate the restructuring goal
(Restrukturierungsziel). This means that, generally, any claims, which shall be subject to the envisaged
restructuring plan, must not be settled or collateralized during the restructuring proceedings.

During the restructuring proceedings, the duty to file for insolvency without undue delay if the debtor
becomes illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) or over-indebted (überschuldet) is generally suspended. However, if such an
insolvency event occurs, the debtor is obliged to notify the restructuring court accordingly without undue delay.
The restructuring court then abrogates the restructuring proceedings unless, in the restructuring courts discretion,
(i) the abrogation of the restructuring proceedings is, against the backdrop of the advanced status of restructuring
proceedings, evidently not in the interest of all creditors or (ii) the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or overindebtedness (Überschuldung) is caused by the enforcement of any such claim that is envisaged to be subject to
the restructuring plan provided the achievement of the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) remains
predominantly likely. Once restructuring proceedings have been abrogated by the restructuring court, the debtor
is again obliged to file for insolvency under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). If (i) the
envisaged restructuring also comprises of consumer claims or claims of small or medium enterprises or
respective collateral granted for the benefit of such claims, (ii) the debtor has filed for a moratorium against all or
essentially all creditors or (iii) the envisaged restructuring plan provides for specific supervision of the settlement
of claims subject to the plan, the restructuring court has to appoint a mandatory restructuring officer
(Restrukturierungsbeauftragter). A mandatory restructuring officer is also to be appointed by the restructuring
court if the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) can predictably only be achieved by a cram-down of
dissenting classes (unless only claims originated by financial institutions and/or shareholders are to be
compromised).

The restructuring court may appoint as mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) any
person with experience in restructurings and insolvencies who is suitable for the respective individual case and
who is qualified as a tax advisor, accountant, lawyer or has comparable qualifications (an “Eligible Restructuring
Officer”); the court may take suggestions by the debtor, creditors or shareholders into account. If (i) the debtor is,
based on expert opinion provided by an Eligible Restructuring Officer, eligible for a moratorium (see —
“Moratorium”), or (ii) creditors of one class with at least 25% of the corresponding votes in such class propose a
mandatory restructuring officer, the court may only appoint a mandatory restructuring officer different from the
proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer if the proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer is evidently inadequate. If
a mandatory restructuring officer is appointed based on the proposal of the debtor or a group of creditors, the
restructuring court may appoint an additional mandatory restructuring officer in its own discretion.

The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) is entitled to decide on the procedure
to be elected for the voting on the restructuring plan (see “—Voting on the restructuring plan”) and can be
empowered by the restructuring court to (i) supervise the debtor’s board and business situation and (ii) receive
payments to and approve payments made by the debtor. If a moratorium is granted, the mandatory restructuring
officer is obliged to monitor that the respective prerequisites of such moratorium persist and, in case such
prerequisites do not persist, entitled to file for a lifting of such moratorium. Additionally, the mandatory
restructuring officer is obliged to comment on the proposed plan’s prospects to remove the debtor’s imminent
illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and restore the debtor’s viability.

The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has to perform its duties independently
and the debtor is obliged to share all relevant information with the mandatory restructuring officer.

The restructuring court can remove the mandatory restructuring officer from office for good cause ex officio
or, if the mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has not acted independently, on the
debtor’s or a creditor’s petition.

Furthermore, the debtor or at least 25% of creditors in a voting class, can request the appointment of an
optional restructuring officer to facilitate the development and negotiation of a restructuring plan. Creditors may
only request such appointment if they agree to be jointly and severally liable for the costs of the optional
restructuring officer. The optional restructuring officer is only obliged to support the stakeholders involved in the
negotiations of the restructuring plan, but has no further powers. An optional restructuring officer can also be
removed from office by the restructuring court ex officio for good cause or, if the optional restructuring officer
has not acted independently, on the debtor’s or a creditor’s petition.

305


-----

Prior to a confirmation and implementation of a restructuring plan, the restructuring court may terminate the
restructuring proceedings for certain reasons, e.g. if the debtor notifies the restructuring court of the occurrence
of an insolvency event unless, in the restructuring court’s discretion (taking into account the actual status of the
relevant restructuring proceedings), the opening of formal insolvency proceedings is obviously not in the interest
of the entirety of the creditors or if the debtor files for insolvency or insolvency proceedings are opened over the
assets of the debtor based on a creditor’s filing.

**_Restructuring plan_**

Key element of the restructuring proceedings is the restructuring plan, which can comprise certain selected
or all (with the exception of employees’ claims, including pensions, and claims based on intentionally committed
acts of tort) of the debtor’s liabilities, or amend the terms of financial and other agreements to which more than
the debtor and one other party are parties, including the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

Any form of financial or operational debt may be compromised, including contingent claims and undue
claims, and relating contractual arrangements including syndicated credit facilities and intercreditor agreements
can be amended by virtue of the plan. Corresponding collateral provided by debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne
_Drittsicherheiten) may also be released and/or granted under a restructuring plan, provided that affected creditors_
are adequately compensated. Consequently, the Notes or the Notes’ Guarantees could also be subject to a
restructuring plan provided the respective debtor has its “centre of main interest” in Germany.

Further, a restructuring plan may provide for a (partial) debt-to-equity swap or other corporate law measures
like a share-capital increase. Debt-to-equity swaps can be implemented without the shareholders’ consent but
require the willingness of at least certain creditors to equitize their debt claims as no creditor can be forced to
take equity as a consideration under a restructuring plan. Hence, if the Notes or Notes Guarantees were subject to
a restructuring plan providing for debt-to-equity swap, single holders of the Notes could not be forced under the
restructuring plan to take equity in the Issuer or a Guarantor without their respective consent.

The restructuring plan will be voted on by creditors of the debtor and must subsequently be confirmed by
the restructuring court. The vote may take place by way of consent solicitation process or in a (virtual) creditors’
meeting. Creditors will be divided into classes determined on the basis of the respective creditors’ economic
interests in the debtor. As a minimum distinction, secured creditors, unsecured creditors, creditors that benefit
from intra-group credit support and subordinated creditors (e.g. shareholders) will form separate classes.
However, also other factors like, e.g., cross-holdings, could be taken into account for class composition. 75% by
value of all claims of one class will be required to approve the plan for such class. There is no numerosity
requirement. Dissenting classes can be crammed down (or up), if

(i) the class members can be expected to be no worse off under the plan than absent the plan (whereby the
alternative scenario must not necessarily be an in-court insolvent liquidation, but can also be an
alternative out-of-court restructuring on a going concern basis);

(ii) the crammed down (or up) class members receive an adequate share in the economic value created by
the plan; and

(iii) a majority of classes has accepted the plan.

A crammed down (or up) class receives an adequate share in the economic value created by the plan if (i) no
other creditor receives more than its claim’s par value, (ii) no creditors that would rank junior in insolvency
proceedings, the debtor or its shareholders receive any value through the plan which is not covered by a
respective stakeholder’s contribution to the plan and (iii) no creditor that would rank pari passu in insolvency
proceedings receives a preferential treatment compared to the dissenting class under the restructuring plan
(unless such preferential treatment is appropriate (sachgerecht) in light of the individual situation of distress to
overcome and the dissenting class accounts for no more than 50% of the rank’s total claims). However, despite
the prerequisite described under (ii) in the foregoing sentence, a creditor class can also be crammed down in case
a shareholder retains equity without any additional contribution if the shareholder itself is crucial for and
bindingly committed to the continuation of the debtor’s business and the realization of the restructuring plan or
the creditors’ rights are only compromised marginally (e.g. by a maturity extension of no more than 18 months).

Upon the debtor’s decision, either the debtor or the restructuring court can lead the voting on the plan. In
case the voting has been led by the debtor, the restructuring court has to hold a hearing of affected stakeholders
before the plan can be confirmed.

The restructuring court will confirm the plan unless (i) the debtor is not (longer) imminently illiquid
(drohend zahlungsunfähig), (ii) there is a material breach of statutory provisions regarding the procedure to adopt

306


-----

the restructuring plan or its permitted content that cannot or has not been cured upon the restructuring court’s
notice, (iii) claims contemplated by or surviving the restructuring plan can obviously be not satisfied by the
debtor or (iv), if new money financing is contemplated under the restructuring plan, the underlying restructuring
concept is incoherent or appears to be based on incorrect facts or to have no reasonable prospect of success.
Additionally, dissenting creditors can request the restructuring court to reject the restructuring plan if the
applicant will be expectedly worse off under the restructuring plan than without the proposed restructuring plan
and the applicant has already raised such concern in the creditors’ meeting or creditors’ hearing, as applicable.
However, such application has no merits if the restructuring plan provides for funds to be distributed to creditors
that can prove to be worse-off, irrespective of whether any such applicant actually benefits from such funds.

Dissenting creditors can appeal against the restructuring court’s confirmation order of the plan if they are
able to produce prima facie evidence (glaubhaft machen) that they are worse-off under the restructuring plan and
funds provided thereunder to compensate worse-off creditors (if any) will not suffice for their individual
compensation. Such appeal will only have suspensive effect (aufschiebende Wirkung) against the effectiveness of
the restructuring plan if requested by the dissenting creditor and ordered by the court based on serious and
irreversible disadvantages for such dissenting creditor that are not in proportion to the benefits of an immediate
implementation of the restructuring plan.

Restructuring plans, which are negotiated and approved in public proceedings and confirmed by a German
restructuring court will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings
Regulation upon the restructuring proceedings being included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of the EU
Insolvency Proceedings Regulation. This is expected to occur in July 2022. In any other case, the recognition of
the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law. As the
Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1, 2021, any such
recognition has not yet been tested as of the date of this offering memorandum.

**_Moratorium_**

In order for the debtor to be able to draw up and negotiate the restructuring plan, the Corporate Stabilization
and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) offers the possibility of having a moratorium ordered by the competent court
upon application by the debtor, which can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors with regards
to their payment claims or the realization of respective collateral over moveable assets. The moratorium can
initially be ordered for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the
moratorium up to a maximum of eight months permissible under certain conditions. Such moratorium may also
be sanctioned with regards to collateral provided by the debtor’s affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten).

The moratorium does not suspend the relevant creditor’s interest claims. However, whereas creditors may
still file an insolvency petition against the debtor during a moratorium, correspondingly initiated insolvency
proceedings are suspended for the time of the moratorium. Under certain conditions, in particular if the
requirements to terminate restructuring proceedings are met or the debtor does not comply with certain statutory
duties under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) the competent court may lift the
moratorium, also on a creditor’s application.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability
company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”).

Consequently, the granting of guarantees, indemnities and security interests by these companies is subject to
certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit
_beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”) and other laws. These provisions would also apply to any future German_
Guarantor in the form of a GmbH or a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liability partner (e.g., Gesellschaft
_mit beschränkter Haftung & Compagnie Kommanditgesellschaft, “GmbH & Co. KG“)._

**_GmbH Limitation Language—General_**

As a general rule, Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its direct or indirect shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets
(meaning, assets minus liabilities and liability reserves as determined under German Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital);
in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, such provisions apply to the general partner which is a GmbH. The granting or

307


-----

enforcement of guarantees or security interests by a GmbH or by a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee or
secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered disbursements under Sections
30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to
secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31,
it is standard market practice for indentures, certain credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to
contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Germany in the legal form
of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or the
security interests agree, subject to certain adjustments and exemptions, to enforce the guarantees or the security
interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s
(or, in case of a KG, its general partner that is a GmbH) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the
case may be, if the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be
further reduced. Accordingly, the Notes Guarantee, the Indenture and the Security Documents provided by the
German Guarantors will contain such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees,
the Indenture and the Collateral is limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the
respective Notes Guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.

**_GmbH Limitation Language—Wording_**

The limitation language for any GmbH or GmbH & Co, KG to be incorporated into the relevant Notes
Documents (as defined in “Description of the Notes”), in particular in the Indenture, will substantially be in the

(ii) The restrictions in paragraph (i) shall not apply:

(A) if and to the extent the Limited Upstream Obligation of the GmbH Guarantor secures any
indebtedness under any Notes Document in respect of:

(1) amounts which are (directly or indirectly) on-lent or otherwise passed on to the relevant
GmbH Guarantor or its Subsidiaries; or

(2) bank guarantees or letters of credit that are issued for the benefit of any of the creditors

obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; or

(2) the GmbH Guarantor and the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor whose obligations are
secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation are both Subsidiaries of a joint

§ 30 (1) sentence 1 GmbHG;

(C) if and to the extent any payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation is covered (gedeckt)
by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger
_Gegenleistungs- oder Rückgewähranspruch) of the GmbH Guarantor against the Issuer or the_
relevant Guarantor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream
Obligation; or

(D) if the relevant GmbH Guarantor has not complied with its obligations pursuant to paragraphs
(iii) and/or (iv) (as applicable) below; however, if and to the extent that the relevant Limited
Upstream Obligation has been enforced without regard to the restrictions contained in this
paragraph (b) because the Management Notification and/or the Auditor’s Determination has

309


-----

not (or not in a timely manner) been delivered pursuant to paragraphs (iii) and/or (iv) (as
applicable) below, but the Auditor’s Determination has then been delivered within four
months from its due date in accordance with paragraphs (iv) below, the Trustee shall upon
demand of the GmbH Guarantor repay any amount received from the GmbH Guarantor
which pursuant to the Auditor’s Determination would not have been available for
enforcement, if the Auditor’s Determination had been delivered in a timely manner.

(iii) If the relevant GmbH Guarantor does not notify the Trustee within fifteen (15) Business Days
after the making of a demand against that GmbH Guarantor under the relevant Limited Upstream
Obligation:

(A) to what extent such Limited Upstream Obligation is an upstream or cross-stream guarantee or
indemnity; and

(B) to what extent a GmbH Capital Impairment would occur as a result of an enforcement of the
Limited Upstream Obligation (setting out in reasonable detail the amount of its GmbH Net
Assets, providing an up-to-date pro forma balance sheet),

then the restrictions set out in paragraph (i) above shall cease to apply until a Management
Notification has been provided.

(iv) If the Trustee disagrees with the Management Notification, it may within twenty (20) Business
Days of its receipt, request the relevant GmbH Guarantor to provide to the Trustee within fortyfive (45) Business Days of receipt of such request a determination by the Auditors or any other
auditors of international standard and reputation appointed by the GmbH Guarantor (at its own
cost and expense) setting out in reasonable detail the amount in which the payment under the
Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a GmbH Capital Impairment subject to the terms set
out under this paragraph (b). Save for manifest errors, the Auditor’s Determination shall be
binding on all parties.

(v) If, after it has been provided with an Auditor’s Determination which prevented it from demanding
any or only partial payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation, the Trustee ascertains in
good faith that the financial conditions of the GmbH Guarantor as set out in the Auditor’s
Determination has substantially improved, the Trustee (acting reasonably) may, at the GmbH
Guarantor’s cost and expense, arrange for the preparation of an updated balance sheet of the
GmbH Guarantor by applying the same principles that were used for the preparation of the
Auditor’s Determination by the auditors who prepared the Auditor’s Determination in order for
such Auditors to determine whether (and, if so, to what extent) the Capital Impairment has been
cured as result of the improvement of the financial condition of the GmbH Guarantor. The Trustee
may not arrange for the preparation of an Auditor’s Determination prior to the expiry of three
months from the date of the issuance of the preceding Auditor’s Determination. The Trustee may
only demand payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation to the extent the Auditors
determine that the Capital Impairment have been cured.

(vi) The GmbH Net Assets shall be adjusted as follows:

(A) the amount of any increase in the registered share capital of the relevant GmbH Guarantor
which was carried out after the relevant GmbH Guarantor became a party to this Indenture
and made from retained earnings (Kapitalerhöhung aus Gesellschaftsmitteln) shall be
deducted from the amount of the registered share capital (Stammkapital) of the relevant
GmbH Guarantor if it is expressly prohibited under the Notes Documents and has been
carried out without the prior written consent of the Trustee;

(B) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 253 (6) HGB shall not be included in
the calculation of GmbH Net Assets;

(C) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 268 (8) HGB shall not be included in
the calculation of GmbH Net Assets;

(D) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 272 (5) HGB shall not be included in
the calculation of GmbH Net Assets; and

(E) loans or other liabilities incurred by the relevant GmbH Guarantor in willful or grossly
negligent violation of the Notes Documents shall not be taken into account as liabilities.

-----

(vii) Where a GmbH Guarantor claims in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b) that the
Guarantee can only be enforced in a limited amount, it shall realize, to the extent lawful and
within reasonable opinion commercially justifiable, any and all of its assets that are shown in the
balance sheet with a book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the
assets and are not necessary for the relevant GmbH Guarantor’s business (nicht
_betriebsnotwendig)._

(c) _Liquidity Impairment Limitation Language_

(i) Save as set out in this paragraph (c), the Trustee shall not enforce, and any German Guarantor
shall have a defence (Einrede) against, any Limited Upstream Obligation if and to the extent a
payment and/or enforcement in respect of a Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a Liquidity
Impairment for such German Guarantor.

(ii) Paragraphs (b)(iii), (b)(iv), (b)(v) and (b)(vii) above (including the repayment contemplated in
paragraph (b)(ii)(D) above) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the restriction in paragraph (i) above
provided that the relevant German Guarantor shall use best efforts to realize to the extent lawful
any and all of its assets that are not necessary for the relevant German Guarantor’s business (nicht
betriebsnotwendig) (irrespective of whether it is commercially justifiable).

(d) Where the provisions of this Section [Š] apply to a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft), all
references to the assets of a German Guarantor shall mutatis mutandis include a reference to the assets
of the general partner (Komplementär) of such limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft).

(e) In addition to the restrictions set out in paragraphs (b) through (d) above, if a German Guarantor
demonstrates that, according to the decisions of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) or a higher regional court of appeals (Oberlandesgericht), the payment under and/
or enforcement of any Limited Upstream Obligation against such German Guarantor would result in
personal liability of its managing director(s) (Geschäftsführer) or director(s) (Vorstände) for a
reimbursement of payments made under any Limited Upstream Obligation (including, without
limitation, pursuant to §§ 30, 31, 43 GmbHG, § 15(b) InsO and/or § 826 BGB), the German Guarantor
shall have a defence (Einrede) against the Limited Upstream Obligation to the extent required in order
not to incur such liability.

(f) The restrictions set out in this Section [Š] do not affect the rights of the Trustee to claim any
outstanding amount again at a later point in time if and to the extent the restrictions set out in this
Section [Š] would allow such claim at that later point in time.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the validity and enforceability of any Limited Upstream Obligation granted
by a German Guarantor or of any subsidiary of a German Guarantor in respect of any borrowing
liabilities which are owed by that German Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries shall not be limited
under Section [Š].

(h) Nothing in this Section shall prevent the Trustee or a German Guarantor from claiming in court that
payments under and/or an enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligations do or do not fall within
the scope of §§ 30, 31, 43 GmbHG, § 15(b) InsO and/or § 826 BGB (as applicable) or that the
limitations set out in this Section are not required to avoid any violation of these laws or liability issues
for any managing director or board director.

(i) Nothing in this Section [Š] shall constitute a waiver (Verzicht) of any right granted under this Indenture
or any other Notes Document to the Trustee or vice versa.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, this Section [Š] and any rights and/or
obligations arising out of it shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, German law.

German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules (including with respect to
Sections 30, 31 GmbHG and Section 15(b) InsO), are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that
future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the
form of a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Guarantors to make payments on the
Notes or the Notes Guarantees or the enforceability of the Notes Guarantees, the Indenture and the Security
Documents relating to the Collateral provided by the German Guarantors.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (meaning, a situation in

311


-----

which a shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may
be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a Guarantee or other collateral granted by the German
Guarantors. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced,
even to nil. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a
security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the
stressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by
disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply
this case law with respect to the granting of the Guarantee or any Collateral by the German Guarantors.

The enforcement of security granted by a German Guarantor may also be excluded (entirely) in case the
granting or enforcement of such security and/or the filing for insolvency as a consequence of a claim by any so
secured finance party under such security resulted or would result in any personal liability of the relevant
German Guarantor’s managing directors pursuant to Section 15(b) InsO.

Furthermore, the beneficiary (for example, a holder of Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a repayment of
the stated share capital of the grantor of a guarantee or security interest, as applicable (for example, the provision
or the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest) could moreover become personally liable under
exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the
case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the
other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention
could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor
of the guarantee or provider of security interest is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire
further with respect thereto.

_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the
pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security interests
(akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not (yet) hold the secured
claim, will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claims is settled, discharged or novated, and may not be
assigned independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is
assigned. The holders of the Notes from time to time will not be party to the Security Documents. In order to
permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under
German law, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a Parallel Debt (as defined therein).
Pursuant to the creation of the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent has its own separate and independent claim equal
to each amount payable by each obligor under, in particular, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. The pledges
governed by German law will directly and exclusively secure the Parallel Debt rather than the obligations under
the Notes or the Notes Guarantees or the holders of the Notes directly. The validity of the Parallel Debt concept
and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such Parallel Debt has not been tested before German
courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German
law. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders
of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—The security interests in the Collateral
_will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security_
_Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement
of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset
constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods
and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral
gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from
foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of
security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds
from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (meaning, the right to request
the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a debtor
or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending)
insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was
provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)

312


-----

held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally
influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores
(Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any
circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse
(Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

**Poland**

**_Overview_**

The validity and enforcement of the Notes Guarantees provided by the Guarantors organized under the laws
of Poland (the “Polish Guarantors”) may be limited by the laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization or other
laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of the rights of creditors in general.

In the event of insolvency of the Polish Guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Poland. Note,
however, that if the centre of main interest of the Polish Guarantor is situated in another European Union
member state, the courts of that state shall have jurisdiction and the insolvency laws of that state shall generally
apply pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015,
on insolvency proceedings (Official Journal No. L 141 of June 5, 2015) (however Polish law will continue to
apply with respect to the enforcement of security interests).

If the centre of main interest of the Polish Guarantor is situated in Poland, the insolvency proceedings will
be governed by the Bankruptcy Law (Prawo Upadłos´ciowe) of February 28, 2003 (consolidated text: Journal of
Laws of 2020, item 1228, as amended) (the “Bankruptcy Law”), and the restructuring proceedings will be
governed by the Restructuring Law (Prawo Restrukturyzacyjne) of May 15, 2015 (consolidated text: Journal of
Laws of 2020, item 814, as amended) (the “Restructuring Law”).

Please find below the general and non-exhaustive description of certain provisions of the Bankruptcy Law
and the Restructuring Law.

Note that the Bankruptcy Law and the Restructuring Law may not be as favorable to your interests as
creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to
obtain interest after the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the duration of the insolvency
proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes and the Notes Guarantees to
an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

**_Insolvent Debtor_**

Bankruptcy proceedings under Polish law may be initiated against insolvent debtors. There are two tests
according to which the state of insolvency of the debtor is determined. The first (liquidity) test is satisfied when
the debtor has lost its ability to satisfy the due monetary debts, provided that such loss of ability to settle due
monetary debts is presumed when the debtor’s delay with the performance of its obligations exceeds three
months. In turn, according to the second (assets) test, debtors being legal persons and organizational units
without legal personality yet enjoying legal capacity are also deemed insolvent in case their liabilities (due and
not due) exceed the value of all the assets of such entity and such situation continues for more than 24 months.
Note that even if the above conditions are met, the court may reject a bankruptcy petition if it determines that
there is no threat to the debtor’s ability to perform its due and payable obligations in a short term.

After the issuance of the Notes Guarantees, the solvency of the Polish Guarantors would be reviewed in
light of the above tests. Yet, the enforceability of the Notes Guarantees would be subject to certain mandatory
provisions of Polish law governing the scope of allowed financial assistance, maintenance of statutory capital and
fraudulent conveyances, as well as adequate level of remuneration payable to the security provider in return for
the grant of security. Therefore, in order to enable the Polish Guarantors to grant guarantees securing the
liabilities of the Issuer without the risk of insolvency of the Polish Guarantors and addressing the other legal
issues raised above, the Notes Guarantees shall contain “limitation language” pursuant to which the liability
under the Notes Guarantees granted by the Polish Guarantors will be limited to the net value of the assets owned
by the Polish Guarantors.

**_Bankruptcy Petition_**

Bankruptcy proceedings are initiated upon submitting a bankruptcy petition. Such a petition may be
submitted by either the debtor or any of its creditors.

313


-----

According to the Bankruptcy Law, the catalogue of persons authorized and obliged to submit a bankruptcy
petition for the debtor has been determined, inter alia, as all persons who on the basis of the law, articles of
association/statute of the company have the right to conduct the company’s affairs and to represent it. The
deadline for submitting the bankruptcy petition is thirty days from the date on which the reason for bankruptcy
occurred.

Note that persons obliged to submit the bankruptcy petition may be held liable for damages resulting from a
delay in submitting the petition to the court.

The court is obliged to refuse to initiate bankruptcy proceedings if the debtor’s assets are insufficient to
cover the cost of the proceedings or, additionally if the debtor’s assets are sufficient to cover only the cost of the
proceedings. The court may also reject the petition to declare bankruptcy if the debtor’s assets are encumbered
with a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, treasury pledge or maritime mortgage to such a degree that the
debtor’s remaining assets are not sufficient to cover the cost of the proceedings.

**_Safeguard Procedure Before the Bankruptcy Proceedings_**

Upon receiving a bankruptcy petition, the court can, ex officio or upon a motion, secure the debtor’s assets.
The court may do so, inter alia, through the appointment of an interim court supervisor (tymczasowy nadzorca
_sa˛dowy) or a mandatory administrator (zarza˛dca przymusowy), and suspend the execution proceedings against_
the debtor (and additionally the court may revoke seizure of a bank account).

**_Bankruptcy Proceedings_**

Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Law, the bankruptcy proceedings are conducted in the form of liquidation
bankruptcy proceedings.

Upon filing of the bankruptcy petition, the court decides whether to initiate the bankruptcy proceedings.
This decision shall be made within two months of submitting the bankruptcy petition, however this deadline has
only instructive character. The date of the bankruptcy is the date on which the bankruptcy order is issued by the
court.

Creditors have the right to submit their claims within thirty days from the announcement of the bankruptcy
order; claims may be submitted also after the lapse of the set deadline, however, all actions undertaken in the
bankruptcy proceedings until that date are valid towards the creditor. Only claims recorded in public registers as
well as employees claims are automatically (ex officio) placed on such a list. If a claim is not included in the list
prepared by a court receiver despite the relevant creditor having submitted the claim, such creditor has the right
to appeal. The procedural requirements for submitting claims are very formal.

**_Prepared Liquidation (So Called “Pre-Pack”)_**

The Bankruptcy Law provides for an institution called prepared liquidation (przygotowana likwidacja), also
called “pre-pack.”

In the pre-pack procedure, the bankruptcy petition may be accompanied by an application for approval of
the terms of sale of a debtor’s enterprise, its organized part or assets representing a major part of its enterprise.
Nevertheless, it may not include assets secured with registered pledge if the registered pledge agreement provides
for foreclosure of the assets or their sale to satisfy a pledgee’s claims (unless a pledgee gives its consent). Such
application for approval of terms of sale must specify at least the sale price and a potential purchaser, and be
accompanied by a valuation report prepared by a certified court expert.

It is possible to request that the debtor’s enterprise will be handed over to the purchaser on the bankruptcy
declaration day, in which case the full price will have to be paid in advance to the court’s deposit account. Note
that the sale to an affiliated company of the debtor is permissible only at a price not lower than the price
indicated in the valuation report.

The court is obliged to accept the application if the offered price is higher than the estimated liquidation
proceeds that could be raised in “standard” bankruptcy proceedings, less the estimated costs of the proceedings.
If the offered price is lower than (but still close to) the estimated net liquidation proceeds, the court will still be in
a position to approve the sale if it is supported by an “important social interest” or if it allows the distressed
enterprise to be preserved.

Each creditor will be entitled to appeal against the court’s decision approving a pre-packed sale within two
weeks of its publication (whereas only the petitioner may appeal against a negative decision).

314


-----

**_Liquidation Bankruptcy_**

As a rule, upon the court declaring bankruptcy, the debtor loses its right to manage its assets and a
bankruptcy receiver (syndyk masy upadłos´ci) is appointed. The financial liabilities of the debtor that have not yet
become due and payable, automatically become due and payable on the day the bankruptcy order is issued. The
debtor’s assets become the bankruptcy estate to be used to settle the debtor’s creditors. The bankruptcy estate is
managed by a bankruptcy receiver appointed by the court. Consent of the creditors’ committee (zgromadzenie
_wierzycieli) or the bankruptcy receiver responsible for administering the bankruptcy is required for specified_
decisions made in relation to some matters connected with the bankruptcy process.

As a rule, the preferred type of liquidation under the Bankruptcy Law is the sale of the bankrupt’s business
as a whole.

**_Ineffectiveness of Some Legal Acts with Respect to the Bankruptcy Estate_**

Following the declaration of bankruptcy, the bankrupt’s assets become the bankruptcy estate, which serves
to satisfy the claims of the bankrupt’s creditors. The bankruptcy estate covers, subject to exceptions, the assets
belonging to the insolvent debtor on the date of the bankruptcy or acquired by it during the bankruptcy
proceedings. The Bankruptcy Law lists assets that are excluded from the bankruptcy estate by virtue of law,
while other assets of the debtor can be excluded from the bankruptcy estate by a resolution of the creditors’
committee or through the proceedings reviewed by the judge-commissioner (se˛dzia-komisarz).

Under the Bankruptcy Law, contractual provisions which provide for a change or termination of a legal
relationship, to which the bankrupt is a party to, due to the declaration of bankruptcy (or in the case of filling a
petition for bankruptcy), are null and void. Furthermore, contractual provisions, which make it impossible or
difficult to achieve the objective of the bankruptcy proceedings, are ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate.

Legal transactions are ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if concluded by the bankrupt within one
year preceding the day, on which the bankruptcy petition was submitted and resulting in the bankrupt disposing
of its assets: (i) without any reciprocal consideration for the bankrupt or (ii) bankrupt’s consideration
significantly exceeds the value of the consideration received by the bankrupt or reserved for the bankrupt or a
third party.

Also ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate is granting of collateral for an undue debt and the payment of
such debt effected by the insolvent debtor in six months preceding the day, on which the bankruptcy petition was
submitted. The beneficiaries of such actions may, however, apply to have these transactions considered effective,
if they have not been aware of grounds for the declaration of bankruptcy while receiving payment or being
granted the collateral.

Moreover, in relation to non-gratuitous legal transactions concluded by an insolvent legal person with its
shareholders, representatives (including their spouses), as well as affiliated companies, their shareholders or
representatives (including their spouses) executed within six months before the day on which the bankruptcy
petition was submitted, the judge-commissioner (se˛dzia-komisarz) is entitled to declare them ineffective (ex
_officio or upon a motion) unless the party to such legal transaction demonstrates that such transaction was not to_
the creditors’ detriment.

In addition, a transfer of future receivable is ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if such receivable
arises after the declaration of bankruptcy, unless the agreement on the transfer of receivable was concluded in
writing with a certified date (forma pisemna z data˛ pewna˛) at least six months before the day on which the
bankruptcy petition was submitted.

Mortgages, pledges, registered pledges or maritime mortgages established by the bankrupt within one year
preceding the day on which the bankruptcy petition was submitted may be challenged in one of the following
situations: (i) the bankrupt was not the personal debtor of the creditor (for example, if the debtor was a guarantor)
and the bankrupt did not receive any consideration in connection with such security, (ii) the consideration
received was substantially lower than the value of the security, or (iii) the security interests was established for
the benefit of its shareholders, representatives (including their spouses), as well as affiliated companies, their
shareholders or representatives (including their spouses). The judge-commissioner, acting upon a motion, is
competent to decide on the ineffectiveness of the established security towards the bankruptcy estate, however in
case described in point (iii) above it is obliged to decide on such ineffectiveness unless the party to such legal
transaction demonstrates that it was not to the creditors’ detriment.

315


-----

Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Law, the judge-commissioner, is authorized to deem ineffective towards the
bankruptcy estate any contractual penalty (reserved for non-performance or improper performance of
obligations) if the obligation was already performed to a large extent or the contractual penalty is excessive.

The security transfer of the ownership title to a thing, claim or other right to the creditor (przewłaszczenie/
_przelew na zabezpieczenie) is effective towards the bankruptcy estate if such agreement has been made in writing_
with a certified date, but for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings the property or rights so transferred by
way of security shall be treated as though it were pledged.

A credit agreement expires on the date bankruptcy is declared if prior to that date the lender did not disburse
the funds to the bankrupt. The lender may pursue a claim in the bankruptcy proceedings for compensation by
filing the claim with the judge-commissioner. If only a portion of the funds was disbursed to the bankrupt prior to
the date of declaring bankruptcy, the bankrupt loses the right to request the disbursement of the remaining
balance.

A declaration of bankruptcy does not affect the bankrupt’s bank account agreement, securities account
agreement, account agreement for derivatives, clearing account or collective account agreement.

**_Certain Other Consequences of Bankruptcy_**

Declaration of bankruptcy proceedings affects the court, arbitratioin, administrative proceedings and
enforcement proceedings pending against the bankrupt. After declaration of bankruptcy, court, arbitration and
administrative proceedings related to the bankruptcy estate may be opened and continued only by a bankruptcy
receiver or against him. Execution proceeding concerning a claim subject to filing to the bankruptcy estate,
opened before the bankruptcy has been declared, shall be stayed by the virtue of law as at the date bankruptcy is
declared. Execution proceeding shall be discontinued by the virtue of law after the decision declaring bankruptcy
becomes final.

**_Satisfaction of Claims in Bankruptcy Proceedings_**

The bankruptcy estate is composed of the assets owned by the bankrupt at the time of declaration of
bankruptcy and the assets acquired thereafter, subject to certain exceptions specified in the Bankruptcy Law.
Once the judge commissioner approves the list of claims and the liquidation is wholly or partially completed, the
receiver prepares the plan of distribution of such funds. Then the plan is submitted to the judge commissioner
who can amend or supplement it. The plan can be objected to within two weeks from the date of its
announcement. All objections are examined by the judge-commissioner whose decision in this respect can be
objected to in the court. If no objections are made against the plan or if, upon the examination of the plan, it has
been corrected, the plan is then executed.

In the case of bankruptcy, settling the creditors’ claims is usually only possible upon the registration of the
claims by the bankruptcy receiver. The claims are satisfied according to certain priorities. The costs of
bankruptcy proceedings shall be satisfied on an on-going basis during the process of liquidation, before first
category. Claims described in the below categories are settled only after all costs of the bankruptcy proceedings,
debts of bankruptcy estate have been settled.

Unsecured creditors’ claims are settled in the following order (as applicable to the bankrupt other than an
individual):

   - first category—this category, inter alia, covers claims arising out of an employment relationship falling
due and payable before the bankruptcy was declared, with certain exceptions, certain contributions to
the social security insurance system, certain claims which arise during restructuring proceedings,
claims arising from credit, loans, bonds, guarantees or letters of credit or other financing arrangement
provided in the approved restructuring proceedings and granted in connection with the performance of
such arrangement (if the bankruptcy was declared as a recognition of a bankruptcy petition submitted
not later than three months after the final repeal of such restructuring arrangement).

   - second category—covers claims not covered in other categories including claims payable to private
creditors as well as tax liabilities, other public levies and contributions to the social security insurance
system. Thus, private creditors are treated equally with tax authorities.

   - third category—covers subordinated interest on claims included in the senior categories in the order, in
which they are paid on the capital, as well as judicial and administrative fines and claims arising under
donations and legacies.

316


-----

   - fourth category—covers shareholders’ claims arising from loan agreements as well as other legal
transactions with similar effects, which were executed within five years before the bankruptcy
announcement was made (with some exceptions such as loans granted within the frame of the
restructuring proceedings or loans granted by the shareholders), shareholders under this category are
also entitled to interest on described transactions.

Settling claims from one of these categories is only possible after fully settling claims of the creditors from
a more senior category. If settling all debts included in the same category is not possible due to lack of assets, the
debts should be settled proportionally.

The liquidation of the bankruptcy estate is performed by selling the bankrupt’s enterprise as a whole or by
organized parts, by selling all immovable and movable property, by enforcing claims against the debtors of the
bankrupt, and by exercising other proprietary rights included in the bankruptcy estate or by alienation thereof.

The Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between two regimes of sale (meaning, a public tender procedure
available to all interested investors or a private sale (z wolnej re˛ki) negotiated by an administrator with a selected
investor). The sale (transfer) of receivables is permissible. As stated above, as a rule, the bankrupt’s enterprise
should be sold as a whole.

The above order does not affect rights of secured creditors as monies obtained from the liquidation of assets,
liabilities and rights encumbered with a mortgage, a pledge or security transfer of title, registered pledge, treasury
pledge, maritime mortgages are allocated to settle creditors’ claims that are secured by such assets, liabilities or
rights (subject to certain exceptions). Monies remaining after settling those creditors’ claims are included in the
bankruptcy estate and satisfied in accordance with categories of claims specified above.

The proceedings will be closed by the court once all the monies are distributed. The court shall also close
the insolvency proceeding in the event of lack of assets or inability to fully settle the creditors’ claims. In some
cases, liquidation may be avoided through arrangement with creditors and the company can continue to operate.

**_Debts Currency and Interest Due in the Bankruptcy Proceedings_**

Any debt payable in a currency other than Polish zloty (such as euro), if being put on the list of debts, must
be converted into Polish zloty at the National Bank of Poland’s average exchange rate for the date the bankruptcy
court issues a decision on the debtor’s bankruptcy (and regardless of whether the debt has fallen due or not).

Furthermore, in case of unsecured claims, interest is satisfied from the assets of the bankruptcy estate only
for the time period until the date the bankruptcy is declared.

**_Restructuring Proceedings_**

In order to enable insolvent debtors or those threatened with insolvency to recover their ability to overcome
financial difficulties, rather than declare bankruptcy, four types of restructuring proceedings are provided by the
Restructuring Law:

   - proceedings for approval of an arrangement (poste˛powanie o zatwierdzenie układu),

   - accelerated arrangement proceedings (przyspieszone poste˛powanie układowe),

   - arrangement proceedings (poste˛powanie układowe),

   - remedial proceedings (poste˛powanie sanacyjne).

As a general rule the above proceedings will not affect the rights of secured creditors to enforce the security
in accordance with the terms of the relevant security documents, except that in remedial proceedings initiating
court enforcement proceedings shall not be allowed.

The above proceedings are aimed at the debtor concluding an arrangement with its creditors (including
partial arrangements), which enable the debtor to satisfy the creditors’ claims and operate further. The difference
in the said proceedings is, among the others, in the scope of the debtor’s rights to manage its assets, and the scope
of the debtors’ protection against the creditors. Proceedings, subject to certain exceptions, are initiated by the
debtor. For instance, also a creditor is entitled to file a petition for the commencement of remedial proceedings in
relation to an insolvent legal person.

The creditors may vote in single or separate groups. If creditors vote in a single group, the arrangement is
concluded if it is accepted by the majority of voting creditors who hold in aggregate at least two thirds of the

317


-----

total sum of claims held by the voting creditors (except for the proceedings for approval of an arrangement,
where the debtor collects the votes in writing itself and the required majority is measured by reference to the total
amount of creditors entitled to vote and not by reference to the amount of voting creditors).

The creditors may be split into separate groups (classes) based on the criteria of “common category of
interests”. In such case, the arrangement is concluded if it is accepted in each group by a majority of voting
creditors in the group whose claims amount to (in aggregate) at least two thirds of the total sum of claims held by
the voting group members (with respective modification of calculating the majority in case of proceedings for
approval of an arrangement described above). Even if there is no required majority in one or more of the groups
of creditors, the arrangement will still be deemed concluded if: (i) the creditors representing in aggregate at least
two thirds of the total sum of claims held by the voting creditors have voted in favor of the arrangement (with
respective modification of calculating the majority in case of proceedings for approval of an arrangement
described above), and (ii) the creditors from the dissenting group/groups are satisfied through the arrangement to
an extent which is not less favorable than in the case of bankruptcy of the debtor (“cross-class cram-down”).

An arrangement accepted by the required majority of creditors is subject to an approval by the court. The
court rejects the arrangement if: (i) it violates the law or (ii) it is obvious that the arrangement will not be
performed. The court is also entitled to reject the arrangement if it is obviously detrimental to creditors who
voted against it and raised objections. The accepted arrangement is binding on all creditors, whose receivables
are, under the law, covered by the arrangement, which may include claims not specified on the creditor’s list.

In case of conflicting petitions for bankruptcy and for restructuring, the court withholds the bankruptcy
petition and the restructuring petition should be considered first (if the restructuring petition is accepted, it will
not be possible to declare bankruptcy as long as restructuring proceedings are pending). Exceptionally, if the
withholding of the bankruptcy petition should be contrary to the interest of all creditors, the bankruptcy court
may decide to consider both petitions at the same time.

Information on bankruptcy and restructuring proceedings will be disclosed in the National Register of
Indebted (Krajowy Rejestr Zadłuz˙onych) operating as of July 1, 2021.

As a general rule, the arrangement covers, subject to some exceptions, all personal claims against the debtor
originated prior to the commencement of the restructuring proceedings (the day of issuing a court’s decision on
the opening of accelerated arrangement proceedings, arrangement proceedings and/or remedial proceedings
further referred to as “commencement date,” in case of proceedings for approval of an arrangement the
consequences of commencing the restructuring proceedings take effect from the arrangement day), together with
interest accruing from the commencement date, as well as conditional claims, if the condition fulfils when the
arrangement is being performed. Above relates both to financial and non-financial claims (except for inter alia
certain social insurance contributions, claims under employment agreements or claims for the handover of
property). If a creditor objects to the restructuring of its non-financial claim (or if due the nature of a
non-financial claim, it is not possible to restructure it), the relevant claim will be converted to a financial one
(with effect from the commencement date). In addition, claims under reciprocal agreements (umowy wzajemne)
are covered by the arrangement only if: (i) the counterparty’s performance is divisible and (ii) only to the extent
that the counterparty has performed the agreement prior to the commencement date of the restructuring
proceedings and has not received a reciprocal consideration from the debtor.

**_“Partial” Arrangements_**

The debtor may enter into a “partial” arrangement (układ cze˛s´ciowy) only with selected classes of creditors
(for example, secured creditors or significant suppliers), however, it is permitted only in (i) an arrangement
approval proceedings and (ii) accelerated arrangement proceedings. It should allow the debtor to reach an
arrangement in a faster and more discreet way. However, the selection of creditors for that purpose must be
compliant with statutory tests (meaning, it must be based on objective, unambiguous and economically justified
criteria) and must not be only aimed at eliminating dissenting creditors from relevant voting classes.

**_Impact of Restructuring Proceedings on Certain Agreements_**

Contractual provisions, according to which termination or modification of legal relationship, to which the
debtor is a party, is triggered by submitting a petition for the commencement of restructuring proceedings or
commencement of such proceedings are void by virtue of law. Also, the terms of agreements with the debtor to
be restructured which make it impossible or difficult to achieve the purposes of restructuring proceedings (except
for arrangement approval proceedings), are ineffective against the debtor’s estate.

318


-----

In principle, upon the commencement of restructuring proceedings (other than arrangement approval
proceedings), it is prohibited to terminate certain agreements which constitute source of incomes for the debtor,
such as tenancy or lease agreements relating to the premises in which the debtor’s enterprise is operated, property
insurances, facility agreements (but only in relation to funds made available to the debtor before the
commencement date), leasing agreements, bank account agreements, suretyships, licences granted to the debtor,
guarantees and letters of credit issued before the commencement date (unless the board of creditors agrees
otherwise).

**_Preservation of Security Interests in Restructuring Proceedings_**

As a rule, it is not possible to establish new security interests to secure a claim not covered by the
arrangement (unless the board of creditors agrees otherwise) once the restructuring proceedings have
commenced. However, if an application to register a mortgage, registered pledge, treasury pledge or maritime
mortgage is filed more than six months before submitting a petition to commence restructuring proceedings, the
mortgage or pledge will be registered (in accelerated arrangement, arrangement and remedial proceedings).

Also, according to a general rule, in rem security interests (for example, mortgage, pledge, registered
pledge, security assignment) securing a claim not covered by the arrangement survive the restructuring
proceedings and the claims secured by any of such security interests are not affected by the arrangement. Hence,
the arrangement covers secured claims to the extent such claims are not covered by the value of collateral, or the
relevant secured creditors agree to be covered by the arrangement. Secured creditors who give their consent to
the arrangement may be assigned to a separate group (class) of creditors and be afforded different treatment in
the arrangements from the one of unsecured creditors.

In relation to partial arrangements, if the proposed arrangement offers the relevant secured creditor full
satisfaction (on a date specified in the arrangement) or satisfaction in part, but to the extent not lower than the
one, which is expected in the case of enforcement of security interest, the relevant secured claim will be covered
by the arrangement irrespective of the creditor’s consent.

**_Proceedings for Approval of an Arrangement_**

These proceedings are available if the sum of disputed claims does not exceed fifteen per cent of the total
claims held by creditors entitled to vote. Although, the debtor continues to manage its assets, it is required to
appoint a licensed supervisor (nadzorca układu), who will: (i) prepare a restructuring plan, (ii) cooperate with the
debtor in preparing the arrangement proposals, (iii) prepare a list of claims and a list of disputed claims,
(iv) assist the debtor in proper collecting the votes of creditors in favor of the arrangement, and (v) prepare a
feasibility assessment of the arrangement in a form of a report.

The debtor determines an arrangement day (dzien´ układowy). Claims arising after the arrangement day are
not subject to the arrangement. The debtor presents a restructuring plan to its creditors and collects their votes on
the arrangement. Once the approving votes of the required regulatory majority have been obtained, the debtor
files a petition with the court (within three months from giving the votes) in order to accept and approve the
arrangement. The debtor also submits to the court a report with a feasibility assessment of the arrangement. The
court issues a decision whether to accept and approve the arrangement within fourteen days from submitting the
petition. From the date of issuing the decision, a licensed supervisor obtains the rights of a court supervisor
(nadzorca sa˛dowy) and is obliged to supervise the proper performance of the approved arrangement.

**_Accelerated Arrangement Proceedings_**

Similarly to proceedings for approval of an arrangement, these proceedings are available if the sum of
disputed claims also does not exceed fifteen per cent of the total claims held by creditors entitled to vote. It may
be used, in particular, if there is a large number of creditors and the debtor is unable to collect their votes on the
arrangement by itself.

The debtor prepares and submits a petition for the opening of the arrangement proceedings together with a
statement that information included therein is true and complete. The court issues a decision whether to accept
and approve the petition within one week from submitting the petition and appoints (i) a court supervisor
(nadzorca sa˛dowy), who will supervise the debtor’s management of its assets and (ii) a judge-commissioner
(se˛dzia-komisarz), who inter alia will manage the restructuring proceedings, supervise the activity of the court
supervisor and—if applicable—(iii) the administrator. If the court refuses to commence accelerated arrangement
proceedings, the debtor may lodge a complaint against it. The creditors, in turn, may lodge a complaint against
the commencement of the accelerated arrangement proceedings, however only to the limited extent.

319


-----

Within 2 weeks from the date on which the accelerated arrangement proceedings are commenced, the court
supervisor prepares and submits to the judge-commissioner (i) a restructuring plan, (ii) a list of claims and (iii) a
list of disputed claims. Subsequently, the judge-commissioner sets the date of the creditors’ meeting for the
purpose of voting on the arrangement and informs of that date the creditors, who are on the list of claims,
providing them with (i) arrangement proposals, (ii) information on division of the creditors on the grounds of
their category of interests as well as on (iii) a manner of way of voting at the creditors’ meeting.

The debtor continues to manage its assets under the supervision of the court supervisor (optionally the court
may appoint an administrator (zarza˛dca) to take over the management of the arrangement estate). The court may
revoke the debtor’s management of assets and establish an administrator if: (i) the debtor does not comply with
the judge-commissioner’s or the court supervisor’s directions, (ii) its management does not guarantee the
performance of the arrangement or if a trustee (kurator) has been appointed for the debtor or (iii) the debtor’s
management does not comply with law (whether intentionally or not) to the detriment (actual or potential) of the
creditors.

In addition, once the accelerated arrangement proceedings are commenced, inter alia: (i) the estate which
enables the debtor to operate its undertaking and the debtor’s estate become the arrangement estate
(masa układowa), (ii) the debtor provides the judge-commissioner and the court supervisor with information and
documents concerning the debtor’s undertaking and assets, (iii) execution proceedings relating to claims covered
by the arrangement are suspended by virtue of law, (iv) the debtor/administrator may not settle performances
from the claims, which are covered by the arrangement when the proceedings are pending (to some extend this
rule does not apply to contractual compensation clauses (klauzula kompensacyjna)).

**_Arrangement Proceedings_**

These proceedings are available only for the debtors, whose disputed claims exceed fifteen per cent of the
total claims held by creditors entitled to vote and, as a result, both types of previous proceedings cannot be
initiated.

The debtor prepares and submits a petition for opening of the arrangement. The debtor needs to demonstrate
in the petition the probability of settling by the debtor the costs of the proceedings and fulfilling liabilities which
will arise after the commencement of arrangement proceedings. In principle, the court issues a decision whether
to open the arrangement within two weeks from submitting the petition (this period may be extended to six
weeks, if it is necessary to conduct a trial).

The court also appoints a court supervisor (nadzorca sa˛dowy), who will supervise the debtor’s management
of its assets and a judge-commissioner (se˛dzia-komisarz), who will manage the restructuring proceedings and
supervise the activities of the court supervisor and, if applicable, the administrator (zarza˛dca).

The court may: (i) secure the debtor’s assets through the appointment of an interim court supervisor
(tymczasowy nadzorca sa˛dowy) for the period between the filing of the petition and the commencement of the
proceedings, (ii) suspend pending enforcement proceedings conducted in order to enforce claims covered with
the arrangement and (iii) revoke the seizure of the debtor’s bank account at the request of the debtor or the
interim court supervisor. The debtor or the creditor who is in the course of conducting the enforcement may
lodge a complaint against the court’s decision to suspend pending enforcement proceedings and to revoke the
seizure of the debtor’s bank account. If the court decides to revoke the seizure of the debtor’s bank account, it
needs to appoint an interim court supervisor, who will give consent to the debtor’s dispositions regarding the
sums maintained on this bank account.

Within thirty days from the commencement of the arrangement proceedings, the court supervisor:
(i) prepares and submits to the judge-commissioner a restructuring plan and a list of claims, (ii) determines the
composition of the arrangement estate (masa układowa) by preparing a specification of inventory (spis
_inwentarza) together with an estimation of the arrangement estate. Upon the receipt of the restructuring plan and_
approval of the list of claims, the judge-commissioner sets the date of the creditors’ meeting for the purpose of
voting on the arrangement and informs the creditors of that date providing them with (i) arrangement proposals,
(ii) information on division of the creditors on the grounds of their category of interests as well as on (iii) a
manner of way of voting at the creditors’ meeting.

The debtor continues to manage its assets under the supervision of the court supervisor (optionally the court
may appoint an administrator to take over the management of the arrangement estate). The court may revoke the
debtor’s management if: (i) the debtor does not comply with the judge-commissioner’s or court supervisor’s
directions, (ii) its management does not guarantee the performance of the arrangement or (iii) its management
does not comply with the law (whether intentionally or not) to the detriment (actual or potential) of the creditors.

320


-----

In addition, once the arrangement proceedings are commenced, inter alia: (i) execution proceedings relating
to claims covered by the arrangement are suspended by virtue of law, (ii) the creditors may initiate judicial,
administrative or judicial-administrative proceedings or proceedings before arbitration courts (sa˛dy polubowne)
regarding satisfaction of claims disclosed in the list of claims, (iii) the court supervisor accedes by virtue of law
to pending judicial, administrative or judicial-administrative proceedings or proceedings before arbitration courts
regarding the arrangement estate.

**_Remedial Proceedings_**

This type of proceedings provides for the broadest scope of restructuring activities and protection against
creditors. Unlike other types of restructuring proceedings, it may be also initiated by the debtor’s personal
creditor (wierzyciel osobisty) (if a debtor is already insolvent) or a trustee (kurator), if appointed by the registry
court.

The debtor prepares and submits a petition for commencing remedial proceedings. The debtor needs to
demonstrate in the petition the probability of settling by the debtor the costs of the proceedings and fulfilling
liabilities which will arise after the commencement of remedial proceedings. The court may secure the debtor’s
assets through the appointment of an interim court supervisor (tymczasowy nadzorca sa˛dowy) or an interim
administrator (tymczasowy zarza˛dca) for the period between the filing of the petition and the commencement of
the proceedings. In principle, the court issues a decision whether to commence remedial proceedings within two
weeks from submitting the petition (this period may be extended to six weeks, if it is necessary to conduct a
trial). The court appoints a judge-commissioner (se˛dzia-komisarz), who will manage the proceedings and
supervise the activities of the administrator (zarza˛dca). The appointment of an administrator to manage the
debtor’s estate (remedial estate) is mandatory. In case the debtor’s involvement is necessary to conduct
successful restructuring and the debtor guarantees proper management, the court may agree to the debtor’s
retaining management over the whole or a part of the undertaking, however only to the limited extent.

Once the court issues the decision on the commencement of remedial proceedings, the debtor is obliged to
pass the whole estate and documents related thereto to the administrator (unless the debtor has been given the
right to manage its assets), and provide the judge-commissioner and the administrator with all necessary or
required information. Subsequently the administrator, in cooperation with the debtor, submits a restructuring plan
to the judge-commissioner within thirty days from the commencement of the proceedings (this period may be
extended to three months), who accepts and approves the restructuring plan upon obtaining, the opinion of the
board of creditors (rada wierzycieli). After obtaining the approval, the administrator performs the restructuring
plan.

In addition, once the remedial proceedings are commenced, inter alia: (i) commercial power of attorney
(prokura) and other powers of attorney granted by the debtor expire by virtue of law (in the course of remedial
proceedings new commercial power of attorney or powers of attorney may be granted by the administrator),
(ii) the administrator is granted the right to terminate the reciprocal agreements (umowy wzajemne) which have
not been performed in full or in part prior to the commencement date, subject to the judge-commissioner’s
consent, (iii) the estate which enables the debtor to operate and the debtor’s estate becomes the remedial estate
(masa sanacyjna), whose components are determined by the administrator by means of preparing a specification
of inventory (spis inwentarza) together with an estimation of the remedial estate (ustalenie składu masy
_sanacyjnej), within thirty days from the commencement of the proceedings, (iv) it is possible to adjust the_
employment level to the needs of the reorganized undertaking, (v) opened inheritance to which the debtor is
appointed, is included in the remedial estate, (vi) pending execution proceedings relating to remedial estate are
suspended by virtue of law, (vii) the creditors may initiate judicial, administrative or judicial-administrative
proceedings or proceedings before arbitration courts (sa˛dy polubowne) which regard satisfaction of claims
disclosed in the list of claims, (viii) judicial, administrative or judicial-administrative proceedings or proceedings
before arbitration courts regarding the remedial estate may be initiated by or conducted against the administrator,
in such case the administrator acts in his/her own name but on behalf of the debtor, (ix) at the request of the
debtor, the judge-commissioner may revoke the seizure of elements included in the remedial estate in the course
of enforcement or proceedings aimed at securing claims (poste˛powanie zabezpieczaja˛ce), if such elements are
necessary for the debtor to operate.

Also, certain legal transactions are ineffective towards the remedial estate once the remedial proceedings are
commenced. These are: (i) transactions by means of which the debtor has disposed of its assets, if they were
concluded by the debtor within one year preceding the day, on which the petition on commencement of the
remedial proceedings was submitted and the value of the debtor’s performance (s´wiadczenie) significantly

321


-----

exceeds the value of the performance received by or reserved for the debtor, (ii) security interests, which have
not been established directly in connection with receiving a performance by the debtor within one year preceding
the day, on which the petition on commencement of the remedial proceedings was submitted (iii) security
interests, which have been established by the debtor within one year preceding the day, on which the petition on
commencement of the remedial proceedings was submitted in the part such security interests exceed more than
the half of the value of secured performance received by or reserved for the debtor together with claims for
ancillary claims on the day of establishing such security interests. The above rules also apply to guarantees,
suretyships (pore˛czenia) and to other similar activities performed to secure performances.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests_**

Comments made below are relevant for the Polish Guarantor, being the Polish limited liability company and
the joint-stock company.

_Governing Law and Enforceability_

In the event of subjecting the Polish Guarantor’s Guarantees and Collateral to the laws of foreign country in
a dispute before a Polish court, only substantive laws of that foreign law will be applied while the laws of
procedure will be governed by Polish law. Furthermore, as a rule, Polish courts can refuse to apply or execute
foreign legal provisions, if the application of such provisions results in the contravention of peremptory rules of
Polish public policy, or if specific law has to be applied regardless of the choice of law (meaning, should any
rights in rem be involved, they will be subject to the laws of the country in which the subject of these rights is
located).

As a general rule, the decisions of Polish courts become final and non-appealable after execution of
appropriate remedy path or after the expiry of the statutory term to file a remedy, subject to applicability of
extraordinary legal remedies if available.

The decisions issued by foreign courts, as the general rule, become enforceable in Poland after establishing
their enforceability by the Polish court. Any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors
outside of Poland (and, in particular, in the United States) would be recognized and enforced in accordance with
the Polish Civil Procedure Code in the courts of Poland. As a general rule of the Polish Civil Procedure Code,
judgments of foreign courts in civil cases are recognized by virtue of law, however, a judgment cannot be
recognized in Poland if:

1. it is not valid in the state where it was issued;

2. it was reached in a case subject to exclusive jurisdiction of Polish courts;

3. the defendant, who did not argue the merits of the case, was not duly and timely served with the court
letter initiating the proceedings and consequently was unable to defend himself/herself/itself;

4. a party to the proceedings was deprived of defense;

5. the same matter between the same parties was pending in Poland earlier before a court of foreign
jurisdiction;

6. it contradicts an earlier valid judgment of a Polish court or an earlier valid judgment of a foreign court
which meets the criteria for its recognition in Poland, reached in a case for the same claim between the
same parties; or

7. its recognition would contradict the basic principles of the legal order of Poland (law and order clause).

Any party wishing to have a U.S. judgment enforceable in Poland must file an application seeking
declaration of enforceability of the U.S. judgment which must be filed with the relevant Polish Regional Court.

As a general rule, the decisions of the courts of other EU member states do not need to be declared
enforceable by the Polish courts, prior to their enforcement in Poland. Enforceability of these decisions may be
challenged, however, in a separate proceedings before the Polish court.

As a general rule, decisions of the Polish courts (including on issuance of enforceability clause) and
appropriate actions of enforcement officers with whom the enforcement of claims is sought may be, depending
on the circumstances, required for the enforcement of the given security interest.

Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European
Union, (with effect from January 1, 2021) the judgements of English courts are recognized and are enforceable in

322


-----

Poland in accordance with, and subject to the conditions of, the Hague Convention of June 30, 2005 on Choice of
Court Agreements (the “Hague Convention”), provided that the choice of court clause contained in the relevant
document is considered as exclusive within the meaning of the Hague Convention. Otherwise, such judgement
will be recognized in Poland in accordance with the Polish Civil Procedure Code pursuant to the rules presented
above with respect to the United States.

_Insolvency as a Result of an Excess of Obligations over the Value of the Company’s Assets_

Obligations of the Polish Guarantor under the Notes Guarantees and Collateral are subject to limitations
resulting from the application of provisions of the Bankruptcy Law.

The companies may be deemed insolvent if the total amount of their liabilities exceed the value of their
assets (except for future and contingent liabilities, including liabilities subject to a suspensory condition, and
shareholder loans or other legal act having the similar effect) and this status continues for longer than twenty four
months. Nevertheless, even if the above conditions are met, the court may reject a bankruptcy petition if it
determines that there is no threat to the debtor’s ability to perform its due and payable obligations in a short term.

_Actio Pauliana_

Polish civil law provides a basis for declaring some actions done to the detriment of creditors ineffective
(so-called “actio Pauliana”). In general, if as a result of a legal act performed by a debtor to the detriment of
creditors, a third party gains a financial benefit, each of the creditors may demand that the said act be declared
ineffective with respect to him, if the debtor acted knowingly to the creditors’ detriment, and the third party knew
or, having used due care, could have learned of it. This provision applies accordingly if the debtor acts with an
intention to harm future creditors. It is assumed that the debtor’s legal act is performed to the creditors’ detriment
if, as a result of such act, the debtor becomes insolvent or becomes insolvent to a greater degree than he was
before performing the act (as described in Supreme Court judgements Case No. II CSK 548/11, Case No. III
CSK 143/16, Case No. III CSK 214/11). The application to the court with respect to “actio Pauliana” can be
filed within five years from the date of the act but not longer than within two years from the opening of
insolvency proceedings (if a debtor has been declared bankrupt).

_Limitation on Enforcement_

Under Polish law, claims may become time-barred (being the six years general term established for claims
and three years term for claims pertaining to periodical performances and claims resulting from an economic
activity; however the end of the period of limitation shall fall on the last day of the calendar year) according to
the Act of 23 April 1964 Civil Code (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2020, item 1740, as amended) (the
“Civil Code”), or may be, or may become, subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim.

In the case of tort claims under Article 442 (1) § 1 of the Civil Code, the period of limitation is three years
from the date on which the injured party becomes aware of the damage and of the person obliged to remedy it;
however, the period cannot be longer than ten years from the date on which the said event causing the damage
took place.

The term “enforceable” means that a claim right or agreement is of a type and in a form enforced by Polish
courts. It does not mean that an obligation will be enforced in accordance with its terms in every circumstance in
Poland. In particular, specific performance may not always be available as a remedy due to other legal
implications such as force majeure, circumvention of law, abuse in the exercise of rights or misrepresentation.

In general terms, any guarantee granted under Polish law must guarantee or secure another obligation to
which it is ancillary and such primary obligation must be clearly identified in the relevant guarantee or security
agreement. Furthermore, a Polish law guarantee and security interests become null if the primary obligation is
null and terminate upon termination of the primary obligation. Moreover, an act in law performed by the original
debtor with its creditor after issuance of the guarantee cannot increase the obligation of the guarantor without its
consent.

If a guarantee given by the Polish Guarantors relates to future debts, then from the perspective of the Civil
Code the maximum amount of guaranteed debt should be specified in the guarantee document. The guarantee
unlimited in time for a future debt may be revoked by the guarantor at any time before the debt arises.

In the event that the security providers are able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed
obligations, Polish courts may consider that the security providers’ obligations under the relevant guarantees or
securities are not enforceable.

323


-----

The above only applies to guarantees and security interests granted under Polish law and may not
necessarily apply to foreign law guarantees and security interests granted by the Polish Guarantor.

_Limitations Resulting from the Polish Commercial Code_

The liabilities assumed by the Polish Guarantor under the Notes Guarantees and the grant of Collateral by
the Polish Guarantor is also subject to certain provisions of the Polish Commercial Companies Code (Kodeks
_Spółek Handlowych) of September 15, 2000 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2020, item 1526, as amended)_
(the “Polish Commercial Companies Code”). With respect to the limited liability company (spółka z ograniczona˛
_odpowiedzialnos´cia˛, sp. z o.o.) and the joint-stock company (spółka akcyjna) pursuant to the Polish Commercial_
_Companies Code, the creation of a limited right in rem over the enterprise or over its organized part requires a_
_resolution of the shareholders under the pain of invalidity._

Pursuant to Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, the shareholders may not receive,
under any title, any payments from the Polish limited liability company’s assets needed to fully cover the share
capital of this company. A breach of this rule results in the shareholders’ obligation to return the payments up to
the amount of the share capital. Therefore, the liability of any Polish Guarantor on account of payments under the
Notes Guarantees and Collateral should be limited, in particular, to the extent that it would result in a reduction
of its assets necessary to cover in full its share capital in breach of Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial
Companies Code.

Pursuant Article 344 § 1 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, it is not permissible to return to a
direct shareholder(s) the share contributions (wpłaty na akcje) unless permitted otherwise. In case of the jointstock companies, the Article 345 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code that regulates the restrictions
concerning financial assistance should be observed.

If a share pledge is enforced and the shareholder changes, a new “relation of domination” might arise. In
such case the new shareholder would be obliged to notify the dependent company, meaning, the Polish
Guarantor, of this fact. Otherwise, its right to vote from its shares representing more than 33% of the share
capital of the dependent company will be suspended. A new relation of domination might also arise if under a
pledge agreement, the pledgee gains a majority of the votes at the general meeting of the Polish Guarantor. The
corresponding notification duty has to be fulfilled by the pledgee.

_Interests Limitation_

Pursuant to Article 359 § 2[1] in conjunction with § 2 of the Civil Code, the maximum interest resulting from
the legal act, meaning, so-called “capital interest” (odsetki kapitałowe) cannot per annum exceed double statutory
interest (meaning, double of the sum of: (i) the reference rate published by the National Bank of Poland and
(ii) 3.5 percentage points). As of the date of this memorandum, the maximum capital interest amounts to 7.2%.

In addition, according to the Article 481 § 2[1] in conjunction with § 2 of the Civil Code, the maximum
interest resulting from a delay (odsetki za opóz´nienie) cannot per annum exceed double statutory interest for
delay (meaning, double of the sum of: (i) the reference rate published by the National Bank of Poland and
(ii) 5.5 percentage points). As of the date of this memorandum, the maximum interest for delay amounts to
11.2%.

Should the value of interest exceed the value of relevant maximum interest, then relevant maximum interest
is due. Contractual provisions cannot exclude or limit the provisions on maximum interest. The above mentioned
specific provision of Polish law shall be applied by a Polish court irrespective of the fact that the parties have
chosen foreign law to govern the transaction (overriding mandatory provisions).

_Clearance from the President of the Polish Office for Protection of Competition and Consumers in Order to_
_Execute Some Rights over Shares_

An exercise of pledge over shares or voting rights in the Polish Guarantor by the holder of the relevant share
security under a power of attorney may be recognized as a change of control pursuant to the Act on Protection of
Competition and Consumers of February 16, 2007 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2021, item 275, as
amended) (the “Competition Law”). Art. 14 of the Competition Law provides with exceptions, when the
clearance from the President of the Polish Office for Protection of Competition and Consumers (the “President of
UOKiK”), is not required. Among others, the notification is not required, when an entity acquires or takes up, on
a temporary basis, stocks and shares with a view to securing debts, provided, however, that such entity does not
exercise the rights arising from these stocks or shares, except for the right to sell.

324


-----

Thus, the holder of such security may be obliged to notify the President of UOKiK about its intention to
exercise its voting rights and to obtain prior antimonopoly clearance as the enforcement of a registered pledge
through the appropriation of the shares by the Security Agent may be recognized as a notifiable concentration
under the Competition Law.

_Perfection Requirements_

Generally, under Polish law, for a valid and effective establishment of security interests certain perfection
requirements need to be fulfilled, including the requirements specified below.

The pledge over the shares in the Polish Guarantor may be validly established only after fulfillment of the
certain perfection requirements including the following: (i) the share pledge agreement must be executed, (ii) the
registered pledge created under such agreement must be registered in the register of pledges maintained by the
competent court; (iii) the Polish Guarantor must be notified and both a financial and a registered pledge over its
shares will become effective vis-à-vis the Polish Guarantor once it is notified; and (iv) the pledges should be
disclosed in the book of shares of the Polish Guarantor.

In principle, a secured creditor can enforce its security once the secured claim becomes mature (that is, the
debt becomes due and payable). Under certain circumstances, the creditor must obtain a final and non-appealable
court decision and enforcement clause before enforcing its security. Private enforcement is possible, for example,
if the claim is secured by registered or financial pledge and the pledge agreement provides that the creditor can
take over the pledge object.

_Parallel Debt Structure under Polish Law_

In majority of cases, under Polish law security interests cannot be granted to a party other than the creditor
of the secured claim. Generally, under Polish law, the pledge or mortgage is strictly accessory and follows the
debt or claim it secures and may not be transferred without such debt or claim. If such debt or claim is transferred
without the pledge or mortgage, the latter will expire.

For that reason, in certain transactions, also in Poland, a parallel debt structure is used, whereby the
guarantor, as a separate and independent obligation governed by non-Polish law, undertakes to pay to the security
agent amounts equal to the amounts due by it to the other creditors. Such parallel debt structure, therefore,
creates a separate and independent claim of the security agent that can be validly secured by a security interest.
Consequently, the security interests are granted to the security agent in its own capacity as a creditor acting in its
own name pursuant to the parallel debt. It is usually expressly agreed in such parallel debt agreement that the
obligations of the debtor towards the security agent shall be decreased to the extent that the corresponding
principal obligations to the creditors are reduced (and vice versa).

The Supreme Court issued the judgments on October 9, 2009 (Case No. IV CSK 145/09, Case
No. IV CSK 169/09 and Case No. IV CSK 155/09) concerning the effectiveness of establishing security interests
over the assets of the debtor of parallel debt. In the above cases, the Supreme Court has not challenged the
validity of a foreign law parallel debt structure, however, such structure was only indirectly referred to in the
above judgments. As there is no doctrine of “precedence” under Polish law, uncertainty exists as to validity and
enforceability of the parallel debt under Polish law.

As Polish law does not recognize the concept of “trust” or “trustee”, it is uncertain how a foreign law trust
will be treated by a Polish court. However, Polish law recognizes the role of a Security Agent with respect to the
registered pledges (administrator zastawu) and the mortgages (administrator hipoteki).

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The following restrictions will apply to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees (the “Securities”). You are
advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of any of the Securities.

None of the Securities have been registered under the Securities Act, and the Securities may not be offered
or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the Securities
are only being offered and sold (A) to QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A and (B) outside the U.S. in an
offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

Each purchaser of Securities will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented and agreed with us and the
Initial Purchasers as follows (terms used in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A or Regulation S under
the Securities Act are used herein as defined therein):

(1) it is purchasing the Securities for its own account or for an account with respect to which it exercises
sole investment discretion and that it and any such account is either (A) a QIB, and is aware that the
sale to it is being made in reliance on Rule 144A or (B) outside the United States;

(2) it acknowledges that the Securities are being offered for resale in a transaction not involving a public
offering in the United States (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and have not been registered
under the Securities Act or any other securities laws and may not be reoffered, resold, pledged or
otherwise transferred within the United States;

(3) it shall not offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer the Securities except (A) to the Issuer or any of its
subsidiaries, (B) inside the United States to a QIB in a transaction complying with Rule 144A,
(C) outside the United States in an offshore transaction in compliance with Regulation S under the
Securities Act, (D) pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (if
available), (E) in accordance with another exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act or (F) pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act. It acknowledges that
no representation is made as to the availability of the exemption provided by Rule 144A for resale of
the Securities;

(4) it agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Securities notice of any restrictions on
transfer of such Securities;

(5) it is relying solely on the information contained in this offering memorandum in making its investment
decision with respect to the Securities. It acknowledges that neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have
made any representation to it with respect to us or the offering or sale of any Securities, other than the
information contained in this offering memorandum which has been delivered to it and upon which it is
relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Securities. It has had access to such
financial and other information concerning us and the Securities as it has deemed necessary in
connection with its decision to purchase the Securities, including an opportunity to ask questions of and
request information from us and the Initial Purchasers;

(6) it acknowledges that prior to any proposed transfer of Securities in certificated form or of beneficial
interests in a Global Note (in each case other than pursuant to an effective registration statement), the
holder of Securities or the holder of beneficial interests in a Global Note, as the case may be, may be
required to provide certifications and other documentation relating to the manner of such transfer and
submit such certifications and other documentation as provided in the Indenture;

(7) it understands that all of the Securities will bear a legend to the following effect unless otherwise
agreed by us and the holder thereof:

“THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”) OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE
OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION
HEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR
OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR UNLESS SUCH
TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
THE SECURITIES ACT.”

following effect:

“THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS SUPPLIED SOLELY FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX

“CODE”), AND THIS LEGEND IS REQUIRED BY SECTION 1275(c) OF THE CODE. HOLDERS MAY

Agent that the restrictions set forth herein have been complied with;

(11) it acknowledges that we, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the
foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgements, representations or agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of the
Securities are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify us and the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring

discretion with respect to each such account and it has full power to make the foregoing
acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each account;

(12) it agrees to indemnify and hold us, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the

becoming false; and

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer, the Guarantors and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, Credit Suisse Securities, Sociedad de
Valores, S.A., BofA Securities Europe SA, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, J.P. Morgan AG, and
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft (the “Initial Purchasers”), have entered into a purchase agreement dated on or
around the date of this offering memorandum with respect to the Notes (the “Purchase Agreement”).

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the
Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount
of the Notes.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to
purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint.

**General**

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the respective issue prices that appear
on the cover of this offering memorandum for each of the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes. After
the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the price at which the Notes are offered and any other
selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes in the United States
through certain of their affiliates or through U.S. registered broker dealers. To the extent the Initial Purchasers
intend to make any offers or sales of the Notes in the United States, or to nationals or residents of the United
States, they will do so only through one or more registered broker-dealers in compliance with applicable
securities laws and regulations, as well as with applicable laws of the various states.

In the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed that:

   - the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to,
among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel and our counsel; and

   - the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will
contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be required to
make in respect of those liabilities.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price set forth
on the cover page hereof.

**Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of each**
manufacturer’s approval process of the Notes, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described
in the offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible
counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended,
“MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to ECPs and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should
take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to the
Issuer’s obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking
its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA (as defined in the offering memorandum) retail investors: The securities**
described in the offering memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and
should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution
Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended or superseded,
the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes

328


-----

has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the
FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018
(“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the
FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance
Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**Prohibition Of Sales To UK Retail Investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise**
made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU)
2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified
investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part
of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the
UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**Securities Not Being Registered under the Securities Act**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and
may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the
United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the
meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made the acknowledgements, representations,_
warranties and agreements as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, an offer or sale of Notes
within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration
requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or
another exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

**Other Jurisdictions**

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of
the EEA or in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the Prospectus Directive. The expression “Prospectus Directive” means Directive 2003/71/EC (as
amended or superseded, including by Directive 2010/73/EU and Regulation (EU) 2017/1129), and includes any
relevant implementing measure in the Member State concerned, if applicable. References to Regulations or
Directives include, in relation to the UK, those Regulations or Directives as they form part of UK domestic law
by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 or have been implemented in UK domestic law, as
appropriate.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that: it has complied and will
comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in,
from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and it has only communicated or caused to be communicated
and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment
activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any
Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the communication.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or
the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction

329


-----

where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection
with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with
any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not
constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or
solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to
inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of
this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Resale Restriction**

The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge
or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale,
pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the
safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

**Market Making and Stabilization**

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions
and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a
short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open
market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions
involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover
short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to
be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. These transactions may include short
sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by
the Initial Purchasers of a greater principal amount of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering.
The Initial Purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing notes in the open market. A short position
is more likely to be created if the Initial Purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the
price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the
offering. If the Initial Purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue
them at any time.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales
may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes or preventing a decline in the market
price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in
the open market.

Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition,
neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Initial Purchasers will engage in
these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In
addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” We do not intend to apply for the Notes to be listed on any securities exchange other than the_
Official List of the Exchange or to arrange for the Notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The Initial
Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, as permitted by applicable law. The
Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity
may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any
such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act, and the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“U.S. Exchange Act”). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market
for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell your Notes at a
particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and
_Our Capital Structure—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to_
_sell the Notes may be limited.”_

**Initial Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the fifth business day following the

330


-----

date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+5“). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S.
Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the
parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the
date of this offering memorandum or the next two successive business days will be required, by virtue of the fact
that the Notes initially will settle in T+5, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to
prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own
advisor.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates from time to time have performed, may currently perform and/
or in the future may perform, various banking activities (including, amongst others, securitization programs, cash
pooling, hedging, agency and/or other banking products or services as well as related credit lines), investment
banking, advisory, consulting and other financial services for the Parent and its affiliates, for which they may
receive customary advisory and transaction fees and reimbursement of expenses. In particular, Goldman Sachs
Bank Europe SE, Credit Suisse Securities, Sociedad de Valores, S.A., BofA Securities Europe SA, Deutsche
Bank Aktiengesellschaft, J.P. Morgan AG, and Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft (or their affiliates) are lenders
under the New Revolving Credit Facility and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch acts as Security Agent under
the New Revolving Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture. Furthermore, certain of
the Initial Purchasers serve as arrangers under the Securitization Program, operate Cash Pooling Agreements and/
or may assist the Parent and its affiliates with the management of foreign currency exchange risk with
corresponding credit lines. In addition, a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes in this Offering
will be used to repay the Existing Term Loan, under which certain Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates
act as arrangers, lenders and/or agents.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our
affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us or our affiliates, certain of
those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are
likely to hedge and certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hedge their credit exposure to us
consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates
would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default
swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any
such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent
research views in respect of the Issuer, Pfleiderer, the Parent, such securities or financial instruments and may
hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany and Poland. None of the directors,
officers or other executives of the Issuer and the Guarantors are residents of the United States. You may be
unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors, officers or executives of the Issuer
and the Guarantors. It may also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within Germany upon
the Issuer, the Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial
Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law implementing such
convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, which may be the case if
such service violated the substantial foundations of German law, in particular the German Basic Law
(Grundgesetz). In addition, as the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ assets and the assets of our and their directors,
officers and other executives are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them
or us judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated on civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of
the United States.

**Germany**

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil
liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action
to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of
Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments,
other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore
may depend on the laws of the relevant U.S. state and federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a final
judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely
upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment
by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court
of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure
(Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the
original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below.

German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final
under applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in section
328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure exist:

   - if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment did not
have jurisdiction;

   - if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense,
provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly;

   - if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a foreign court
which is to be recognized in Germany;

   - if the judgment

   -, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible with a proceeding in
Germany which was pending (rechtshÃ¤ngig) before a German court before the U.S. federal or state
court entered its judgment;

   - if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of German
law, in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights (Grundrechte)
guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

   - if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and enforce a
comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances).

Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case law to the effect that
reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to assets
(vermögensrechtliche Ansprüche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you that
attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German court would
accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S. federal securities
laws.

332


-----

In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts as
incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of
damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate
actual losses or damages.

Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal
securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being
of a penal or punitive nature.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so far as
the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common
law provided for pretrial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the
production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this
matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pretrial discovery process exists under
German law.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in
Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under
such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the Issuer or such persons
will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment
relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the
judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of process
within Germany upon the German Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on the Service Abroad of
Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law
implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, which
may be the case if such service violated the fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights
(Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German
Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the
action before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.

**Poland**

Any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors outside of Poland (and, in particular, in
the United States) would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the Polish Civil Procedure Code in the
courts of Poland. As a general rule of the Polish Civil Procedure Code, judgments of foreign courts in civil cases
are recognized by virtue of law, however, a judgment cannot be recognized in Poland if:

(1) it is not valid in the state where it was issued;

(2) it was reached in a case subject to exclusive jurisdiction of Polish courts;

(3) the defendant, who did not argue the merits of the case, was not duly and timely served with the court
letter initiating the proceedings and consequently was unable to defend himself/herself/itself;

(4) a party to the proceedings was deprived of defense;

(5) the same matter between the same parties was pending in Poland earlier before a court of foreign
jurisdiction;

(6) it contradicts an earlier valid judgment of a Polish court or an earlier valid judgment of a foreign court
which meets the criteria for its recognition in Poland, reached in a case for the same claim between the
same parties; or

(7) its recognition would contradict the basic principles of the legal order of Poland (law and order clause).

The judgements of English courts are recognized and are enforceable in Poland in accordance with, and
subject to the conditions of, the Hague Convention of June 30, 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements (the “Hague
Convention”), provided that the choice of court clause contained in the relevant document is considered as
exclusive within the meaning of the Hague Convention. Otherwise, such judgement will be recognized in Poland
in accordance with the Polish Civil Procedure Code pursuant to the rules presented above.

Any party with a legal standing is entitled to file a motion with the relevant Polish District Court for
conformation that a given judgment may or may not be recognized in Poland.

333


-----

Any party wishing to have a U.S. or U.K judgment enforceable in Poland must file an application seeking
declaration of enforceability of the U.S. or U.K judgment which must be filed with the relevant Polish Regional
Court.

Any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors in any country bound by the provisions
of EU Regulation number 44/2011 of the Council on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements**

**Principles and Methods**

**1. General Information**

**Background**

The Consolidated Financial Statements of PCF GmbH, Neumarkt,Germany (formerly Pfleiderer GmbH or
“PCF”) and its subsidiaries (hereafter referred to as “Pfleiderer PCF Group” reflect (i) the consolidated financial
statements of (a) the Engineered Wood Products business and (b) the Silekol Chemicals business (hereafter
referred to as “Silekol”). The Pfleiderer PCF Group is under the control of Pfleiderer Group B.V. & Co. KG and
managed centrally by the managing board of Pfleiderer Group B.V. & Co. KG.

The consolidated financial statements consist of consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated
statements of profit and loss and comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity,
consolidated statements of cash flows and notes to the consolidated financials statements for the fiscal years
ended 31 December 2020, 2019 and 2018 (collectively referred to hereafter as “consolidated financial
statements”) and a opening statement of financial position as of 1 January 2018.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the European Union (“IFRS EU”).

The Pfleiderer PCF Group is primarily involved in manufacturing and veneering of wood and wood-based
products and paper finishing, as well as domestic and foreign trade.

**Basis of Preparation**

**Statement of compliance**

The following financial statements of the Pfleiderer PCF Group were prepared according to the recognition,
measurement and presentation requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)—as
endorsed by the European Union (“EU”)—on a consolidated basis. The consolidated financial statements were
authorised for issue by the Managing directors of PCF GmbH on 22 March 2021.

These Consolidated financial statements are the first financial statements of Pfleiderer PCF Group in
accordance with IFRS 1. Pfleiderer PCF Group prepared these consolidated financial statements applying
IFRS 1.D16(b) and hence the carrying amounts of Pfleiderer PCF Group’s assets and liabilities may not
correspond to the carrying amounts included in the Pfleiderer Group B.V. & Co. KG consolidated financial
statements prepared under IFRS as endorsed by the EU.

The transition date to IFRS is on 1 January 2018. Due to the fact that Pfleiderer PCF Group did not prepare
consolidated financial statements prior to 1 January 2018, the explanation of transition effects from previous
GAAP to IFRS on the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flow is not relevant.

These consolidated financial statements represent for all periods the structure of the Pfleiderer PCF Group
business as if the acquisition of Silekol had occurred on 1 January 2018. The acquisition of Silekol has taken
place on 6 March 2020.

Pfleiderer PCF Group has made an accounting policy election to which common control transactions will be
applied using book value accounting and all comparative reporting periods will be adjusted as if the transfer had
occurred at the start of the earliest period presented. As a result, assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the
Silekol transfer will be accounted for utilizing the historical book values previously recognized by Pfleiderer
Polska Sp Z.o.o for all periods presented.

Pfleiderer PCF Group applied IFRS 1.D16(b) upon adoption of IFRS 1.

Transactions between the Pfleiderer PCF Group and subsidiaries that are not part of Pfleiderer PCF Group
are recognized in accordance with IFRS and classified as related-party transactions. The consolidated financial
statements reflect all material transactions between the Pfleiderer PCF Group and the Pfleiderer Group B.V. &
Co. KG.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill has been adjusted upon first-time adoption of IFRS 1 to reflect historical goodwill that was not
accounted for under previous GAAP. Pfleiderer PCF Group has adjusted the carrying amount of all acquired

F-10

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**1. General Information (Continued)**

subsidary’s assets and liabilities to properly account for the assets and liabilities under IFRS. Goodwill is
reflected within the financial statements as the difference between the following at the date of transition to IFRS:

(i) the interest in the adjusted carrying amounts; and

(ii) the cost in the parent’s separate financial statements of its investment in the subsidary

**Cash flow**

The consolidated statements of cash flows were prepared using the indirect method.

**Income and deferred taxes**

Current and deferred income taxes are recognized in accordance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes). The German
subsidiaries of Pfleiderer PCF Group are members of the tax group with Pfleiderer B.V. & Co. KG.

**Going concern**

Management continues to have a reasonable expectation that the Pfleiderer PCF Group has adequate
resources to continue in operation for at least the next 12 months and that the going concern basis of accounting
remains appropriate. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted by governments in
Europe to mitigate its spread have impacted the Company. Although this has negatively impacted the Group’s
financial performance and liquidity position during the year, for the year ended 31 December 2020, Pfleiderer
PCF Group recognised a net profit of EUR 43 564 thousand. The Pfleiderer PCF Group net current assets as at
31 December 2020 were EUR 14 093 thousand. Pfleiderer PCF Group has EUR 71 189 thousand of cash and
cash equivalents, as well as other highly liquid assets and unused credit lines available at the date of authorisation
of these financial statements. There is still uncertainty over how the future development of the outbreak will
impact the Pfleiderer PCF Group business and customer demand for its products. The appropriateness of the
going concern basis of accounting is dependent on the continued availability of borrowings by compliance with
loan covenants. Pfleiderer PCF Group has a term loan of EUR 445 million requiring compliance with interest
cover covenants. Management’s forecasts indicate that the Pfleiderer PCF Group is able to meet or exceed their
debt covenant requirements for at least the next 12 months. As at the date of authorisation of the financial
statements, Pfleiderer PCF Group had sufficient headroom on its facilities. Also, to respond to a severe downside
scenario, management has the ability to take the following mitigating actions to reduce costs, optimise the
Company’s cash flow and preserve liquidity:

   - reducing non-essential capital expenditure and deferring or cancelling discretionary spend;

   - freezing non-essential recruitment; and

   - reducing marketing spend. Based on these factors, management has a reasonable expectation that
Pfleiderer PCF Group has adequate resources and sufficient loan facility headroom.

**2. Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations**

**Adoption of new and revised Standards**

A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been published but were not
yet effective for annual period ending on 31 December 2020 and have not been applied in the consolidated
financial statements. Pfleiderer PCF Group intends to apply them for the periods for which they are required to
be applied for the first time.

_IFRS issued, EU endorsed and effective in the reporting period_

   - IFRS 16 (“Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions—in the second quarter of 2020, the International
Accounting Standards Board published an amendment to IFRS16 (“Covid19-Related Rent
Concessions”), in which they provide an accounting policy choice to lessees to apply practical relief for
rent concessions arising because of the covid-19 pandemic. Pfleiderer PCF Group does not apply this
practical expedient for lessees.

_Standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that have been endorsed by European Union but are not_
_yet effective:_

   - IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16—Interest rate benchmark reform (amendments to

1 January 2021.

_Standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that have not been endorsed by European Union:_

   - IAS 1 Classsification of liabilities as current or non-current and Classsification of liabilities as current

postponed by one year to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.

   - IAS 8—Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of AccountingEstimates- IAS 8 is amended to replace the definition of a change in accounting estimates with a

Framework;

ii. add to IFRS 3 a requirement that, for transactions and other events within the scope of IAS 37 or
IFRIC 21, an acquirerer applies IAS 37 of IFRIC 21 (instead of the Conceptial Framework) to
identify the liabilities it has assumed in a business combination; and

iii. add to IFRS 3 an explicit statement that an acquirer does not recognise contingent assets acquired
in a business combination.

The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022.

   - IAS 16—Proceeds before the intended use- The amendment clarifies that income received by a
company from the sale of items that were manufactured while the asset was being prepared for its
intended use and the associated costs should be recognized in profit or loss. Subject to adoption in EU
law, the changes are to be applied to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022.

   - IAS 37 Onerous Contracts—Cost of fulfilling a contract-The changes include defining what costs a
company should include when assessing whether a contract will be forfeited. Subject to adoption in EU
law, the changes are to be applied to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022.

   - Annual Improvements Project 2018-2020- The following standards have been changed as a result of
the Annual Improvements to IFRS.

i. In IFRS 1, subsidiaries that are first to apply and make use of IFRS 1.D16 (a) have the option of
valuing cumulative exchange differences using the amounts reported by the parent company.

ii. The amendment to IFRS 9 clarifies which fees are to be included in the 10% test (IFRS 9.B3.3.6)
with regard to the assessment of whether a financial liability will be derecognized.

iii. In IFRS 16, the description of the reimbursement of leasehold improvements has been removed in
the explanatory example 13 for IFRS 16.

iv. In IAS 41, the prohibition on considering tax payments in the context of fair value measurement
has been deleted.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**2. Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations (Continued)**

Subject to adoption in EU law, the changes are to be applied to reporting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2022

   - IFRS 17—Amendment to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts—(deferral of IFRS 9)- IFRS17 will replace the
currently applicable IFRS 4. It establishes more transparency and comparability with regard to the
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts with the insurer. The
application of IFRS 17 is mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.

The impact of the abovementioned standards, interpretations and amendments to standards has been
analysed by Pfleiderer PCF Group. It is expected that the implementation of these standards will not have a
significant impact on the financials at Pfleiderer PCF Group. In addition, further standards and intepretations
have been approved by the International Accounting Standards Board which are not expected to have a material
impact on the financials at Pfleiderer PCF Group.

**3. Accounting Policies and Valuation Principles**

Pfleiderer PCF Group’s accounting policies have been applied consistently in all periods presented in these
consolidated financial statements and have been applied consistently by Pfleiderer PCF Group entities.

**a) Basis of accounting**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis,,except for derivative
financial instruments, C02 emission rights and receivables subject to factoring agreements, which are measured
at fair value.

**(i) Common control acquisitions**

The acquisition of a business under common control is accounted for using the pooling of interests method.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are applied using the historical book values in the financial statements of
the transferor. Historical book values of the business are reflected as of the earliest date presented in the
Statement of Financial Position.

**(ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation**

Balances and transactions and any unrealised income and expenses between consolidated entities, are
eliminated.

**b) Functional and presentation currency**

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro (EUR) and all amounts have been rounded to
the nearest thousand (EUR’000) unless stated otherwise.

Functional currency of Pfleiderer PCF Group companies is EUR except for Silekol (Polish zloty). The
majority of Pfleiderer PCF Group’s net sales are generated in EUR. Thus, Pfleiderer PCF Group selected EUR as
the presentation currency for its consolidated net sales financial statements.

**c) Estimates and judgements**

In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of Pfleiderer PCF Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are
recognised prospectively.

Information about judgements, assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of
resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year is
included in the following notes:

**d) Measurement of fair values**

A number of Pfleiderer PCF Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair
values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

Pfleiderer PCF Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values.
Pfleiderer PCF Group regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party
information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then Pfleiderer PCF Group
assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the
requirements of IFRS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified.

When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, Pfleiderer PCF Group uses observable market data
as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs
used in the valuation techniques as follows.

   - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

   - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

   - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value
hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value
hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.

Pfleiderer PCF Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the
reporting period during which the change has occurred.

Further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes:

   - Note 23—financial instruments.

**e) Financial instruments—classification and measurement**

**(i) Non-derivative financial instruments**

Pfleiderer PCF Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the ‘amortised cost’ and ‘fair value
through other comprehensive income’ FVOCI under IFRS 9 starting from 1 January 2018.

Pfleiderer PCF Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities
category and measure them at amortised cost.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**3. Accounting Policies and Valuation Principles (Continued)**

Pfleiderer PCF Group initially recognises loans and receivables on the date when they are originated. All
other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date when the entity becomes a
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Pfleiderer PCF Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially
all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred, or it neither transfers nor retains
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control over the transferred asset. Any
interest in such derecognized financial assets that is created or retained by Pfleiderer PCF Group is recognized as
a separate asset or liability.

Pfleiderer PCF Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or
cancelled, or expire.

A financial asset and a financial liability shall be offset and the net amount presented in the statement of
financial position when, and only when, an entity:

   - currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts; and

   - intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

In accounting for a transfer of a financial asset that does not qualify for derecognition, the entity shall not
offset the transferred asset and the associated liability.

**(ii) Non-derivative financial assets**

The classification categories of non derivative financial assets are aligned with the measurement which
enhances simplicity. Financial assets may be classified only to the following 3 categories:

   - financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss;

   - financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income;

   - financial assets measured at amortised cost.

Pfleiderer PCF Group classifies financial assets to the appropriate category depending on the business
model of financial assets management and on the characteristics of contractual cash flows for a given financial
asset.

Pfleiderer PCF Group classifies as assets measured at fair value through profit or loss: trade receivables in
respect to the part subject to factoring agreements. These assets are held within the business model which
objective is to sell financial assets.

Pfleiderer PCF Group classifies as assets measured at amortised cost: long-term investment, trade
receivables not sold to the factor, cash and cash equivalents and other receivables. These assets are held within
the business model which objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows. Additionally, the
assets passed SPPI test and therefore will be measured at amortised cost.

No financial assets are classified by Pfleiderer PCF Group to the category of assets measured at fair value
through other comprehensive income.

Financial assets are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other
comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss on the basis of both:

   - the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and

   - the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:

   - the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to
collect contractual cash flows and

F-15


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**3. Accounting Policies and Valuation Principles (Continued)**

   - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

A financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both of the following
conditions are met:

   - the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and

   - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and

   - A financial asset shall be measured at fair value through profit or loss unless it is measured at
amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits at banks.

**(iii) Non-derivative financial liabilities**

Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable
transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Pfleiderer PCF Group’s financial liabilities measured at amortised cost comprise borrowings and other debt
instruments as well as trade and other payables.

The fair value for disclosure purposes is determined based on the present value of future cash flows from
repayment of principal and interest, discounted using the market interest rate as at the reporting date.

**(iv) Derivative financial instruments**

Pfleiderer PCF Group uses financial derivatives, mainly forward contracts, to hedge its currency-exchange
risk exposures related to its operating or investing activities.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs are recognised when incurred and
charged to the profit or loss of the period. Subsequent to initial recognition, Pfleiderer PCF Group measures
derivatives at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit and loss. However, if financial
derivatives are classified as hedging instruments, the recognition of gains or losses on measurement to fair value
depends on the type of the item hedged with such derivatives.

At the initial recognition of a derivative financial instrument as a hedging instrument, Pfleiderer PCF Group
formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged position. The
documentation includes the purpose of risk management and the strategy of the hedge and the hedged risk, as
well as the methods that the Pfleiderer PCF Group will use to evaluate the effectiveness of the hedging
instrument.

**f) Property, plant and equipment**

**(i) Owned property, plant and equipment**

Items of property, plant and equipment are recognised at acquisition or production cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses.

Acquisition cost comprises the price for which a given asset was purchased (i.e. amount due to the seller,
less any deductible taxes: VAT and excise tax), public charges (in the case of imports), and costs directly related
to the purchase and adaptation of the asset for use, including the cost of transport, loading, unloading and storage.
Rebates, discounts and other similar reductions decrease the asset acquisition cost. The production cost of
property, plant and equipment or a tangible asset under construction comprises all expenses incurred by
Pfleiderer PCF Group to construct, install, adapt or improve such assets, including non-deductible VAT or excise
tax, until the day on which the asset was available for use in a manner intended by the management. The
production cost also comprises the estimated cost of dismantling and removing items of property, plant and

F-16

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**3. Accounting Policies and Valuation Principles (Continued)**

equipment, as well as of restoring them to their initial condition, if such an obligation exists. Additionally, the
production cost includes borrowing costs associated with the acquisition or production of an item of property,
plant and equipment or a tangible asset under construction.

Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are determined based on estimated useful
lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and verified at least annually. If significant parts of
an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items
(major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant or equipment is determined as a difference
between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item, and is recognised in profit or loss.

**(ii) Subsequent expenditure**

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with
the expenditure will flow to Pfleiderer PCF Group. Expenditures related to repair and maintenance of property,
plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

**(iii) Depreciation**

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, or substantial and individual elements thereof, is calculated
over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, taking into account the residual value and is
recognised in profit or loss.

The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment adopted by Pfleiderer PCF Group for current
and comparative periods are as follows:

**Engineered Wood**
**Products** **Silekol**

Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 – 33 years 5 – 33 years
Plant and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 – 30 years 2 – 25 years
Vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 20 years 5 years
Other tangible assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 20 years 3 – 5 years

Short useful life in the category of buildings relates to improvements in buildings.

Long useful life in the category of vehicles relates to forklifts and other special purpose vehicles used in
plants.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if
appropriate.

**g) Intangible assets**

**(i) Other intangible assets**

Other intangible assets that are acquired by Pfleiderer PCF Group and have finite useful lives are measured
at cost of purchase net of accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Intangible assets for which, on acquisition, Pfleiderer PCF Group is not capable of determining their useful
lives are classified as having indefinite useful lives and thus are not amortised. Pfleiderer PCF Group performs an
annual assessment of the remaining useful lives of such assets and if those become finite—amortisation
commences over the remaining useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for
impairment on an annual basis regardless of impairment indicators.

**(ii) Subsequent expenditure**

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the
specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill
and brands, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

F-17

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**3. Accounting Policies and Valuation Principles (Continued)**

**(iii) Amortisation**

Amortisation of intangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful
lives, unless their useful economic lives are indefinite and is generally recognised in profit or loss. Goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite useful life are not amortised and are subject to impairment testing at the end of
each financial year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. Other intangible
assets are amortised from the date that they are available for use.

The estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets are as follows:

**Engineered Wood**
**Products** **Silekol**

Licences . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 – 7 years 2 – 6 years
Computer software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 7 years 2 – 6 years

Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted
if appropriate.

**h) Inventories**

Inventories are measured at the lower of the acquisition or production cost and net realisable value. Net
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated cost to complete
and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

The cost of inventory is determined in the following manner:

Materials and merchandise—at acquisition cost; based on the weighted average method.

Finished goods and work in progress—cost of direct materials and labour and an appropriate share of
production overheads based on normal operating capacity; based on the weighted average method.

**i) Impairment**

**(i) Non-derivative financial assets**

Pfleiderer PCF Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables and
contract assets by applying the simplified approach in accordance with IFRS 9.5.5.15. Consequently, Pfleiderer
PCF Group always recognises lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) on these financial assets. Loans to related
parties are not included in the ECL model but are individually assessed for impairment.

All material financial assets are tested for impairment at each reporting date. Pfleiderer PCF Group allocates
financial assets to a credit risk grade based on data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss
(including but not limited to external ratings, audited financial statements, management accounts and cash flow
projections and available press information about customers) and applying experienced credit judgement. Credit
risk grades are defined using qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of the risk of default. The
determination of whether a financial asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk is based on an
assessment of the probability of default, which is made at least quarterly, incorporating external credit rating
information as well as internal information on the credit quality of the financial asset.

The financial assets within each credit risk grade are segmented and an ECL rate is calculated for each
population based on delinquency status and actual credit loss experience. These rates are multiplied by factors to
reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical data has been
collected, current conditions and Pfleiderer PCF Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives of
the receivables.

Pfleiderer PCF Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the debtor is in
severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor has been placed
under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings, or in the case of trade receivables, when the
amounts are over two years past due, whichever occurs sooner. Financial assets written off may still be subject to
enforcement activities under the Pfleiderer PCF Group’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice
where appropriate.Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account.

F-18


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**3. Accounting Policies and Valuation Principles (Continued)**

If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an
event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed
through profit or loss.

**j) Equity**

PCF is not a listed entity and therefore Pfleiderer PCF Group is not required to disclose earnings per share in
accordance with IAS 33 ‘Earnings per Share’ (“IAS’33”).

**k) Employee benefits**

**(i) Short-term employee benefits**

Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for
the amount expected to be paid if Pfleiderer PCF Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this
amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

**(ii) Defined benefit plans**

Pfleiderer PCF Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated by estimating the
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods and discounting that
amount.

The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the
projected unit credit method.

Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses are
recognised immediately in OCI. Pfleiderer PCF Group determines the net interest expense on the net defined
benefit liability for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the
beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability, taking into account any changes in the net
defined benefit liability during the period as a result of benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses
related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.

When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that
relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Pfleiderer
PCF Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.

**(iii) Other long-term employee benefits**

In accordance with the remuneration system of Pfleiderer PCF Group, employees of Pfleiderer Silekol
Sp. z o.o. are entitled to receive retirement benefits (one-off payment upon retirement).

Pfleiderer PCF Group’s retirement benefit obligations are determined by estimating the amount of future
remuneration of the employee at the time of the employee’s retirement, and by estimating the amount of the
future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount to present
value.

Measurement of liabilities under defined employee benefit plans and employee benefits are evaluated by an
actuary. The valuation is based on assumptions regarding interest rates, remuneration increase, inflation rate, and
employment turnover. The calculation of retirement benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified
actuary using the projected unit credit method. The employee turnover is estimated based on historical data and
projections concerning future employment levels. All assumptions and estimations carry significant risk of
resulting in material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.

All changes between the balance of employee benefit obligations as at the beginning and the end of a
reporting period, other than benefits paid are recognised in other comprehensive income.

**l) Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when Pfleiderer PCF Group has a current liability (legal or constructive
obligation) resulting from past events and when it is probable that settling the obligation will result in an outflow
of resources embodying economic benefits and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.

F-19


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**3. Accounting Policies and Valuation Principles (Continued)**

Recognition of provisions and contingent liabilities requires the estimation of the probable outflow of
economic benefits and making the best estimate of expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end
of reporting period. Provisions are recorded based on the best estimate of the Management Boards of Pfleiderer
PCF Group. All estimates have significant assumption and estimation risk which could result in a material
adjustment of their carrying amounts. Future operating losses are not provided for.

If the effect of changes in the time value of money is significant, the amount of provisions is determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the liability. If the discounting method is applied, an increase in
provisions as a result of the passage of time is recognised as finance costs.

The obligation for the distribution of CO2 emission rights to the relevant government authority is
recognized in the statement of financial position when granted and recognized in the subsequent periods.

Income from the sale of rights granted are recognized as other operating income.

If at the reporting date, Pfleiderer PCF Group does not have sufficient quantities of rights to fully cover the
amount of carbon dioxide emitted in a period, Pfleiderer PCF Group raises a provision to cover the shortfall of
rights.

**m) Leases**

**Definition:**

At inception of a contract, Pfleiderer PCF Group assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a
period of time in exchange for consideration.

**Presentation:**

At the commencement date a lessee shall recognize a right-of-use asset (RoU) and a lease liability.

The following comments are restricted to the agreement that Pfleiderer PCF Group acts exclusively as the
lessee and not as the lessor.

Right-of-use asset and lease liabilities (short- and long-term) are presented in the statement of financial
position separately from other assets/liabilities positions.

The leased assets are reported seperatley on the Statement of Financial Position. Furthermore, the minimum
lease payments are reported under financial liabilities positions. The liabilities shall be split between a current
portion and a non-current portion.

**Recognition:**

At the commencement date, a lessee shall recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.

The requirements of the Standard are not applied to:

   - Short-term leases—which means leases with a lease term of 12 months or less with no purchase option;

   - Leases for low value assets; by Pfleiderer PCF Group low value assets are assets of value below 5 000
USD for the new asset (regardless of the age of the asset being leased).

An underlying asset can be of low value only if:

   - The lessee can benefit from use of the underlying asset on its own or together with other resources that
are readily available to the lessee; and

   - The underlying asset is not highly dependent on, or highly interrelated with, other assets.

   - If an asset is subleased to another entity, the head lease does not qualify as a lease of a low value asset.

The commencement date of the lease is the date on which a lessor makes an underlying asset available for
use by a lessee.

F-20


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**3. Accounting Policies and Valuation Principles (Continued)**

The lease term is the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both:

   - periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that
option; and

   - periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise
that option.

In determining the lease term and assessing the length of the non-cancellable period of a lease, an entity
shall apply the definition of a contract and determine the period for which the contract is enforceable. A lease is
no longer enforceable when the lessee and the lessor each has the right to terminate the lease without permission
from the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty.

In case of agreements for an indefinite period the contract terms are analysed and the lease term is settled as:

   - period covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessor can terminate the agreement at any time
without significant penalty; or

   - period assessed by the department responsible for the contract or the Management as reasonably
certain.

At the commencement date, the department responsible for the contract/the Management assesses whether it
is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease or to purchase the underlying asset based on
business plans and historical practice.

**Measurement:**

Initial measurement:

At the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the RoU asset at cost. The cost of the RoU asset shall
comprise:

Lease liability amount

+ Lease payment made before the commencement date

+ Initial direct cost

+ Estimate of incurred costs of dismantling or removing the asset

   - Lease incentive received

At the commencement date the lease liability should be measured at the present value of the lease payments
that are not paid at the date. The lease payments shall be discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if
that rate can be readily determined. If the rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee shall use the lessee’s
incremental borrowing rate.

Pfleiderer PCF Group applied IFRS 1.D9B upon adoption of IFRS 1 in regard to the measurement of leases
under IFRS 16. At the date of first time adoption of IFRS 16, the lease liability is measured at the present value
of the remaining payments, discounted using the Pfleiderer PCF Group’s incremental borrowing rate in
accordance with IFRS 1.D9B(a).

The incremental borrowing rate is calculated based on cost of external financing (separately for Engineered
Wood Products and Silekol). Pfleiderer PCF Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining
interest rates from various external financing sources to reflect the terms of the lease and the type of the asset
leased.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following payments for the
right to use the underlying asset during the lease term that are not paid at the commencement date:

Fixed payments

+ Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate

F-21


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**3. Accounting Policies and Valuation Principles (Continued)**

+ Residual value guarantees

+ Exercise price of a purchase option (if the lesee is reasonably certain to exercise that option)

+ Payments of penalties for terminating the lease (if payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the
lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease)

   - Lease incentives receivable

Subsequent measurement:

After the commencement date the RoU asset is measured applying a cost model.

To apply a cost model, a lessee shall measure the RoU asset at cost:

   - Less any accumulated depreciation (IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment)

   - Accumulated impairment losses

   - Adjust for any remeasurement of the lease liability

The RoU asset should be depreciated over the following period:

   - The useful life of the underlying asset in case if the ownership of the underlying asset will be
transferred by the end of the lease term;

   - The earlier of the end of the useful life of the RoU asset or the end of the lease term in case if the
ownership will not be transferred.

After the commencement date the lease liability shall be measured by:

   - Increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;

   - Reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and

Remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised
in-substance fixed lease payments.

**n) Income**

**(i) Net sales from sales of finished goods/merchandise and services**

An entity accounts for a contract with a customer only when all of the following criteria are met:

   - the parties to the contract have approved the contract (in writing, orally or in accordance with other
customary business practices) and are committed to perform their respective obligations;

   - the entity can identify each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred;

   - the entity can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred;

   - the contract has commercial substance (i.e. the risk, timing or amount of the entity’s future cash flows
is expected to change as a result of the contract); and

   - it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for
the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. In evaluating whether collectability of an
amount of consideration is probable, an entity shall consider only the customer’s ability and intention
to pay that amount of consideration when it is due. The amount of consideration to which the entity
will be entitled may be less than the price stated in the contract if the consideration is variable because
the entity may offer the customer a price concession

The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for
transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for
example, some sales taxes). The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed
amounts, variable amounts, or both.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**3. Accounting Policies and Valuation Principles (Continued)**

Net sales from provision of services includes mainly net sales from transportation services, which are
recognised when a service is completed (i.e. the items are delivered to the recipient).

Net sales is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. Pfleiderer PCF
Group recognises net sales when it transfers control over a good or service to a customer.

The following table provides information about the nature and timing of the satisfaction of performance
obligations in contracts with customers, including significant payment terms, and the related net sales recognition
policies:


**Type of product/service**

Engineered Wood Products
division—sale of finished goods

Silekol—sale of chemicals

**o) Financial income and costs**


**Nature and timing of satisfaction of**
**performance obligations, including**
**significant payment terms** **Net sales recognition policies**


Performance obligations satisfied
at a point in time, payment terms
between 14-90 days, on average
up to 30 days

Performance obligations satisfied
at a point in time, payment terms
between 14-60 days, on average
14-20 days


The net sales are recognized,
when the performance obligation
is satisfied by transferring the
promised good to a customer. An
asset is transferred, when the
customer obtains control of that
asset. The transfer of control is
mainly determined by the agreed
Incoterms.

The net sales are recognized,
when the performance obligation
is satisfied by transferring the
promised good to a customer. An
asset is transferred, when the
customer obtains control of that
asset. The transfer of control is
mainly determined by the agreed
Incoterms.


Finance income includes interest income on funds invested by Pfleiderer PCF Group, dividend income,
gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in profit or loss, foreign currency gains (excluding gains from
foreign currency differences classified as other operating income arising from trade receivables, trade liabilities,
cash and fixed assets purchases and disposals) and reclassifications of net gains previously recognised in other
comprehensive income. Interest income is recognised in profit or loss on an accrual basis using the effective
interest rate method.

Finance costs include interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and deferred
consideration, losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in profit or loss, foreign currency losses
(excluding losses from foreign currency differences classified to other operating income), and impairment losses
recognised on financial assets (other than trade receivables), reclassification of net losses previously recognised
in other comprehensive income. Interest expense that is not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction
or production of a qualifying asset is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.

Foreign currency gains and losses are presented on a net basis as either finance income or finance costs or in
other income if relate to operating foreign exchange differences.

**p) Result of income tax**

Result of income tax comprise of current tax and deferred tax. Result of income tax is recognised in profit or
loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and
any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or

**3. Accounting Policies and Valuation Principles (Continued)**

receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related
to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assetsand
liabilities for tax purposes and the amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The recognition of deferred tax assets and the availability of future taxable profit against which carry
forward tax losses can be used incorporates assumption and uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting
in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the deferred assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met. Deferred tax related to
transactions recognised directly in equity is recognized in equity.

Deferred tax asset is not recognised for:

   - temporary differences on initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business
combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;

   - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the
extent that Pfleiderer PCF Group is able to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences
and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future;

   - taxable temporary differences arising on initial recognition of goodwill (only deferred tax liability).

Deferred tax assets are recognised in relation to all deductible temporary differences as well as unused tax
losses carried forward, in the amount it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they
can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of
future taxable profits improves.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are calculated using tax rates that are expected to be effective
at the time of realisation of a particular asset or liability, based on tax rates (and tax legislation) using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which
Pfleiderer PCF Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and
liabilities.

**Application of formal approach in 2020**

As per end of reporting year 2020 the German companies included in the sub-group are members of the tax
group with Pfleiderer B.V. & Co. KG being the ultimate parent. The profit and loss transfer agreement between
PCF GmbH and Pfleiderer B.V. & Co. KG has been concluded on 18 November 2020 and has been registered in
the commercial registry on 23 November 2020 being effective for FY 2020 beginning 1 January 2020. No cost
allocation of taxes (Steuerumlage) is contractually agreed.

By the end of reporting year 2019 the sub-group presents current and deferred taxes for the tax group
subsidiaries of Pfleiderer PCF Group and standalone subsidiaries, Silekol in particular. This is because PCF
GmbH is a standalone taxpayer from legal perspective by the end of reporting year 2019.

With the extended tax group membership in 2020 the taxable income of Pfleiderer PCF Group and its tax
group subsidiaries is shifted to the non-consolidated parent company Pfleiderer B.V. & Co. KG. From the legal
perspective PCF GmbH is no longer a taxpayer as the taxable income of PCF GmbH is shifted to a
non-consolidated parent company. Consequently both, current and deferred taxes of german tax group
subsidiaries, are not recognized in the group financial statement of Pfleiderer PCF Group as per end of 2020. For
this purpose, any deferred tax amounts deriving from years up to 2019 were released through profit and loss and
other comprehensive income as of 1 January 2020.

The reported income taxes as per end of the year 2020 refer solely to companies Heller Holz GmbH, that is
not a member of the German tax group, to Silekol that is located in Poland and to the foreign sales entities of the
Pfleiderer PCF Group that are not located in Germany . In regard to these entities the principles stated for FY
2019 have been applied unchanged also for FY 2020.

**4. Currency Translation**

**(i) Foreign currency transactions**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Pfleiderer PCF
Group companies at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities presented in foreign currencies valued at historical cost are translated at
exchange rates effective as at the transaction date. Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from settlements of
transactions in foreign currencies and from the conversions of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are recognized in profit/loss in the period in which they arise.

**(ii) Foreign operations**

As at the end of the reporting period, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into the
functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are
translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates as at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency
differences are recognised in other comprehensive income accumulated in other reserves. At the time of disposal
of a foreign operation any accumulated currency-translation differences are transferred to profit or loss as part of
the gain or loss on disposal.

**(iii) Exchange differences on translation to presentation currency**

Exchange differences relating to translation of financial statements from functional currency to presentation
currency are recognised in other comprehensive income. The method of translation to a presentation currency is
consistent with the translation of a foreign operation for consolidation purposes. Exchange differences arising
from translation from functional to presentation currency are not transferred to profit or loss.

**10. Result of income tax (Continued)**

of Pfleiderer PCF Groupand its tax group subsidiaries is shifted to the non-consolidated parent company
Pfleiderer Group B.V.&Co. KG. From the perspective of PCF consolidated financial statement, no current
income tax arises for fiscal years beginning 2020 at the level of each tax group member. Due to the application of
the formal / legal approach also no deferred tax is recognized for these entities as the reversal of underlying
temporary differences in the future will lead to a current tax expense outside of the Pfleiderer PCF Group. This
explains the reconciling tax impact of EUR 9 950.

The effect of foreign tax rates refers to the reduced statutory tax rate of 19% for the Polish entity Silekol.

**Impairment test of cash generating unit containing goodwill**

CGUs in Pfleiderer PCF Group

Pfleiderer PCF Group defines the cash-generating unit for the deemed goodwill recognized in a business
combination based on the reporting structure. The two defined cash generating units are Engineered Wood
Products and Silekol. This is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The deemed goodwill is allocated to the Engineered Wood Products cash generating unit.

Recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units were retrospectively determined based on a calculation of
their fair values less cost to disposal for years 2018-2020 including opening balance. The calculations were
performed based on cash flow projections adopted in the five-year budgets approved by the Management Board.
The fair value was determined using the net present value approach.

The values assigned to the key assumptions represent Management’s assessment of future trends in the
relevant industries and have been based on historical data from both external and internal sources.

The discount rate was applied to reflect the risks specific to a given cash generating unit. A rate of return on
10-year treasury bonds was assumed as the risk-free rates. Separate risk free rates were adopted for Engineered
Wood Products.The main assumptions used to calculate the fair values less cost to disposal were as follows:

**Engineered Wood Products**

**31 Dec. 2020** **31 Dec. 2019** **31 Dec. 2018** **1 Jan. 2018**

Terminal growth rate beyond the five-year period covered
by the budget . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.00% 1.00% 1.00% 1.00%
Risk free rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.10% -0.33% 0.37% 1.02%
Market risk premium . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.25% 6.50% 6.00% 6.99%
Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.00% 6.46% 6.48% 7.46%

The key assumptions for cash-generating units includes the level of net sales and operating expenses in each
forecasted period. Those assumptions were based on a formalised process of budgeting and financial planning
within Pfleiderer PCF Group. The forecast level of sales was assumed to follow market trends as expected by
Pfleiderer PCF Group management which is supported by their views of industry analyses and market research.
The level of expenses was primarily based on historical experience and expected trends in market prices of raw
materials used by Pfleiderer PCF Group.

The fair value calculated using the methodology adopted by Pfleiderer PCF Group for both cash-generating
units is a Level 3 measurement.

**Engineered Wood Products:**

Pfleiderer PCF Group grants its employees defined benefit pension commitments on a case-by-case basis. In
addition, there are still prior commitments in place from various pension systems, the benefits of which cover
pensions for old age, disability and surviving dependents. The pension funds were closed to new entrants on or
before 31 May 1986.

There are several defined benefit pension plans and individual commitments to current and former
employees in effect within the Pfleiderer PCF Group. Some defined benefit pension plans are final salary plans,
while others provide for fixed pension amounts. The amount of pension payments is also based on the
beneficiary’s seniority. All pension plans are subject to the legal provisions of the German Company Pension Act

[Betriebsrentengesetz]. Among other things, this legislation stipulates that, from the outset, the amount of
benefits disbursed must be adjusted in line with the development of the general consumer price index. Because
the pension obligation is coupled to the consumer price index, the pension plan is subject to risks due to changes
in the rate of inflation, interest and the life expectancy of pension beneficiaries.

Benefits disbursed under defined benefit pension plans in Germany are primarily a function of the number
of years of an employee’s service, the individual’s age, and his or her salary. The costs and obligations arising
under defined benefit pension plans are determined on the basis of actuarial reports prepared using the projected
unit credit method. This method considers the services already performed by the employees in relation to the
valuation date and also includes estimates with regard to future salary and pension trends. Within the reports
drawn up for the valuation at 31 December, the following assumptions were made for the defined benefit plans:

**31 Dec. 2020** **31 Dec. 2019** **31 Dec. 2018** **1 Jan. 2018**

Discount factor . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.50% 0.84% 1.80% 1.65%
Wage increase rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.50% 2.50% 2.50% 2.50%
Pension adjustment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.80% 1.80% 1.80% 1.80%

The discount factor applied roughly corresponds to the interest rate that could be achieved for blue-chip,
fixed-interest corporate bonds (AA rating) with a corresponding maturity on the market on the valuation date of
the benefit obligation. The annual rate of salary increases, together with pension adjustments, was taken into
account in the calculation of pension entitlements.

With respect to defined benefit plans, Pfleiderer PCF Group’s obligation is to provide benefits to active and
former employees as promised.

The present value of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) not covered by plan assets as of the reporting date
amounted to EUR 54 249 thousand (shortfall) (EUR 54 107 thousand for 31 December 2019, EUR 49
607 thousand for 31 December 2018 and EUR 51 082 for 1 January 2018).

In 2020 the experience-based adjustments to benefit obligations amounted to EUR -430 thousand (EUR
418 thousand for 31 December 2019, EUR 227 thousand for 31 December 2018 and EUR 13 thousand for
31 January 2018) and the actuarial losses due to changes in financial assumptions amounted to EUR 2
529 thousand (EUR 6 323 thousand for 31 December 2019, EUR 962 thousand for 31 December 2018 and EUR
2 395 thousand for 1 Jan 2018). According to the new Heubeck mortality tables the actuarial gains and losses
from changes to demographic assumptions amounted to EUR 0 thousand (EUR 0 thousand for 31 December
2019, EUR 675 thousand for 31 December 2018 and EUR 0 thousand for 1 January 2018).

At the end of the reporting period, the average maturity of the defined benefit obligation amounted to 13
years.

The benefit obligations as at 31 Dec 2018, 31 Dec 2019 and 31 Dec 2020 were calculated based on the
Heubeck mortality tables 2018G.

A quantitative sensitivity analysis of the key assumptions as of the reporting date is shown below.

**31 Dec. 2020** **31 Dec. 2019** **31 Dec. 2018** **1 Jan. 2018**

**Effect on the defined benefit obligation**
Increase of the interest rate by 0.25% . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -1 784 -1 774 -1 537 -1 628
Decrease of the interest rate by 0.25% . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 885 1 875 1 621 1 719
Increase of the future pensions by 0.25% . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 562 1 568 1 326 1 391
Decrease of the future pensions by 0.25% . . . . . . . . . . . . -1 494 -1 499 -1 271 -1 332

year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 771 3 615 3 019 3 082

The above sensitivity analyses have been specifically and individually evaluated; these values are not the
outcome of a process of estimation. The probability of fluctuation does not represent a significant actuarial
assumption, as the pension funds were closed to new entrants on or before 31 May, 1986, and the probability of
fluctuation approaches zero with advancing age.

**Objectives and methods of financial risk management applied by the Pfleiderer PCF Group**

Pfleiderer PCF Group’s Management has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of
Pfleiderer PCF Group’s risk management framework.

Pfleiderer PCF Group’s financial risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks
faced by Pfleiderer PCF Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to
limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and
Pfleiderer PCF Group’s activities.

Pfleiderer PCF Group’s operations are exposed to the following risks:

   - credit risk

      - market risk, including:

          - foreign currency risk and

          - interest rate risk

      - liquidity risk.

The objective behind credit risk management is to reduce Pfleiderer PCF Group’s losses which could follow
from customers’ insolvency. This risk is mitigated with the use of receivables insurance and factoring agreements
and securitization programme.

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices—such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates—will
affect Pfleiderer PCF Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of

F-57


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**23. Financial instruments (Continued)**

market risk management is to reduce the unfavourable effects of changes in market risk factors on the cash flows
and financial results.

Market risk management is conducted using derivative instruments which are used solely to reduce the risk
of changes in fair value and risk of changes in cash flows.

Derivative (currency forwards) transactions are concluded only with reliable partners, authorized to
participate in transactions through the application of appropriate procedures and signing relevant documentation.

The objective of currency risk management is to minimize losses arising out of unfavourable changes in
foreign exchange rates. Pfleiderer PCF Group monitors its currency position from the point of view of cash
flows. To manage its currency risk, it first relies on natural hedging and where necessary uses forward contracts.
The time horizon adopted for position monitoring and hedging transactions is analysed on a case by case basis.

The objective of financial liquidity management is to protect Pfleiderer PCF Group from insolvency. This
objective is pursued through regular projection of debt levels in a five-year horizon, and arrangement of
appropriate financing.

Pfleiderer PCF Group is exposed to credit risk, interest rate risk and currency risk in the ordinary course of
business. Financial derivatives are used to hedge the risk related to exchange rate fluctuations.

**(i) Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to Pfleiderer PCF Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from Pfleiderer PCF Group’s
receivables from customers.

Transactions which expose Pfleiderer PCF Group to credit risk include trade receivables and cash and cash
equivalents. In accordance with the Management Board’s policy, Pfleiderer PCF Group’s credit risk exposure is
monitored on an ongoing basis.

Credit risk associated with bank deposits is assessed by Pfleiderer PCF Group as low due to deposits of its
assets only in financial institutions which have a high short-term credit rating.

The credit risk related to trade receivables is limited, as the customer base is very wide and the risk is highly
diversified. Therefore, the credit risk concentration is insignificant. Moreover, Pfleiderer PCF Group operates a
strict receivables management policy, whereby the risk of customer insolvency is mitigated through the use of
trade credit insurance and factoring (division Silekol) and securitisation programme (division Engineered Wood
Products). At 31 December 2020, approximately 95% of Pfleiderer PCF Group’s trade receivables (31 December
2019: 85%, 31 December 2018: 87% and 1 January 2018: 86%) were secured with insurances. In the event of
insolvency of customers who have insurance coverage, compensation is paid by the insurer. Each customer has a
trade credit limit (usually covered by an insurance limit).

Pfleiderer PCF Group did not incur any significant losses due to customer default. Allowances for
impairment losses are recognised on receivables and on amounts corresponding to Pfleiderer PCF Group’s
deductibles for receivables that are insured, based on detailed impairment analysis of accounts receivable. All
receivables are subject to the impairment test without taking into accounting the collateral.

The carrying amount of each financial asset, including financial derivatives, represents the maximum credit
risk exposure.

The total credit risk exposure was as follows:

**(ii) Interest rate risk**

Pfleiderer PCF Group holds funds in bank accounts and has liabilities under bank borrowings and term loan
B (TLB). Pfleiderer PCF Group also incurres costs of interests under factoring agreements. The interest rate risk
is related to interest payments with floating interest rates. Pfleiderer PCF Group does not hedge the interest rate
risk for the time being.

Pfleiderer PCF Group monitors the level of interest costs on a regular basis.

**Sensitivity analysis of cash flows for variable-rate financial instruments**

The below interest rates variations were calculated based on observations of interest rates fluctuations in
2020, 2019 and 2018.

A 100 basis points (1%) change in interest rates would lead to a change in net profit by the amounts
presented below. The analysis is based on the assumption that other variables, especially currency exchange
rates, remain unchanged. The following analysis refers to cash flows:

**1 Jan 2020 –** **1 Jan 2019 –** **1 Jan 2018 –**
**31 Dec 2020** **31 Dec 2019** **31 Dec 2018**

**Sensitivity analysis of fair value of fixed-rate financial instruments**

Pfleiderer PCF Group does not hold any financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value through profit
or loss or any interest rate derivatives as hedging instruments.

Therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the statement of profit and loss and
comprehensive income through changes in the fair value of financial instruments.

**(iii) Currency risk—transaction risks**

Pfleiderer PCF Group is exposed to currency risk mainly due to the extent that there is a mismatch between
the currencies in which trade transactions, purchases of materials and merchandise and borrowings are
denominated and the respective functional currencies of Pfleiderer PCF Group companies. The functional
currency of Pfleiderer PCF Group companies is primarily the Euro (EUR) and Polish zloty (PLN). The main
currencies in which foreign currency transactions are denominated are Euro, US dollars and pound sterling
(GBP). However, foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from exchange rate fluctuations mostly offset each
other (natural hedging).

Pfleiderer PCF Group also incurs capital expenditures in foreign currencies. Pfleiderer PCF Group monitors
its foreign currency positions on an ongoing basis and hedges its currency risk of open positions with forward
transactions. Pfleiderer PCF Group uses forward contracts to hedge its currency risk related to commercial
transactions (export of goods). The forward contracts used to hedge Pfleiderer PCF Group’s commercial
transactions in Silekol consist of the sale of EUR at a pre-determined rate. This helps to secure margins on export
sales and to mitigate the risk of adverse changes of the margins due to appreciation of the Polish zloty.

Forward and swap contracts are measured at the end of each month.

Extension options:

Some property leases contain extension options exercisable by the Pfleiderer PCF Group up to one year
before the end of the non-cancellable contract period. Where practicable, Pfleiderer PCF Group seeks to include
extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension options held are exercisable only
by Pfleiderer PCF Group and not by the lessors. Pfleiderer PCF Group assesses at lease commencement date
whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. Pfleiderer PCF Group reassesses material
contracts whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant
changes in circumstances within its control.

and, subject to registration, the registered pledge over the shares in Pfleiderer Polska Sp. z o.o. and granted the
power of attorney to exercise corporate right from the pledged shares in favor of Trigon Dom Maklerski S.A. (the
“Polish Security Agent”).

As at 2020, certain members of the Pfleiderer PCF Group have guaranteed the liabilities under the EUR
450 million senior facilities agreement, such members of the Pfleiderer PCF Group are: PCF GmbH, Pfleiderer
Deutschland GmbH, Pfleiderer Neumarkt GmbH, Pfleiderer Leutkirch GmbH, Pfleiderer Gütersloh GmbH,
Pfleiderer Arnsberg GmbH, Pfleiderer Baruth GmbH. In addition Pfleiderer Group B.V. & Co. KG and some of
its Polish subsidiaries have also guaranteed these liabilities.

**Other Information**

**26. Contingent liabilities**

Pfleiderer PCF Group subsidiaries are parties to court cases, for which the Management Board of PCF
GmbH estimates probability of losing as less than 50%. They constitute contingent liabilities.

Several customers have claimed damages due to anticompetitive price collusion regarding wooden raw
material products, including uncoated and coated chipboard as well as MDF and HDF panels that were sold by
Pfleiderer PCF Group companies. The outcome of the respective extrajudicial negotiations or proceedings is
difficult to predict. Based on its best knowledge the Management estimated provisions of EUR 3 775 thousand as
of 31 December 2020 EUR including legal costs related to proceedings with W. Classen GmbH & Co. KG
(“Classen”) as well as legal costs and amicable settlements of claims with Oeseder Möbel-Industrie Mathias
Wiemann GmbH & Co. KG (“Oeseder”). The provisions related to court proceedings recognized as of
31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018 amounted to EUR 4 150 thousand including costs related to legal
proceedings with Classen as well as legal costs and amicable settlements of claims with Oeseder. As of 1 January
2018 the provisions amounted to EUR 3 150 thousand.

In December 2012, W. Classen GmbH & Co. KG (Classen) filed an action for damages with the District
Court (DC) Düsseldorf (Landgericht Düsseldorf) against Pfleiderer Baruth GmbH (formerly: Pfleiderer
Faserplattenwerk Baruth GmbH) currently amounting to approximately EUR 55.4 million (plus interest). By
judgment on the merits dated 9 August 2019 the DC Düsseldorf held that Pfleiderer Baruth is principally liable
for damages caused by the infringement but without yet deciding on the quantum of the claim. On 10 February
2021, the Court of Appeals (CoA) Düsseldorf (Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf) has confirmed the judgment on the
merits and did not admit a further appeal to the Federal Court of Justice (FCJ). The outcome of the proceeding,
especially regarding the amount of damages payable by Pfleiderer Baruth to Classen—if any—cannot be

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**26. Contingent liabilities (Continued)**

assessed yet since its determination is subject to separate proceedings on quantum which will start after a final
and binding decision on the merits.

In December 2012, Oeseder Möbel-Industrie Mathias Wiemann GmbH & Co. KG (Oeseder) filed an action
for damages with the DC Hannover (Landgericht Hannover) against Sonae Arauco Deutschland GmbH (“Sonae”
formerly: Glunz AG) amounting to approximately EUR 26 million (plus interest). Oeseder, inter alia, seeks
damages for chipboard purchased from the Pfleiderer PCF Group. PCF GmbH’s obligation for payments may
result from a contribution claim (Gesamtschuldnerinnenausgleich) based on PCF GmbH’s joint and several
liability (Gesamtschuld), if Sonae was ordered to pay compensation to Oeseder. Therefore, PCF GmbH has
joined the proceedings as a third party to defend the claim (Streithelfer/ Nebenintervenient). By judgment on the
merits dated 31 May 2016, the DC Hannover held that Sonae is liable for damages caused by the infringement.
The appellate proceedings are now pending at the CoA Celle (Oberlandesgericht Celle) which has indicated that
it will largely (but not entirely) uphold the judgment on the merits and also rule on quantum. The CoA has
suggested a settlement of EUR 10 million based on a very simple comparison of average EUWID prices before,
during and after the cartel. The next oral hearing is scheduled for 22 June 2021 and will presumably focus on the
damage estimation. The potential indirect costs that may arise in connection with this litigation or the amount of
damages that might be required to be paid cannot be forecasted.

In December 2015, ALNO AG filed an action inter alia against PCF GmbH with the DC Dortmund
(Landgericht Dortmund) seeking damages of EUR 28.4 million for chipboard deliveries between 2002 and 2008.
Following a settlement between PCF GmbH and ALNO AG the insolvency administrator withdrew the legal
action against PCF GmbH. After ALNO had settled with the remaining defendants Egger and Glunz, the court
proceedings finally ended in 2018.

In July 2016, Hüls AG filed an action with the DC Hannover against Sonae and Egger Holzwerkstoffe
Brilon GmbH & Co. KG (“Egger”) seeking damages of EUR 38.8 million for all chipboards supplied by Sonae,
Egger and Pfleiderer companies from 2002 to 2008. PCF GmbH did not join the proceedings as third party.
Following a settlement between Pfleiderer and Hüls in April 2017 for all claims based on Pfleiderer deliveries,
Hüls excluded all Pfleiderer deliveries from the proceedings. As Hüls has settled all of the claims with Egger and
Glunz in 2019, the court proceedings finally ended in 2019. The risk of new follow-on damage claims is rather
low since these claims should be time-barred by now.

Pfleiderer Deutschland GmbH (Pfleiderer) received a letter dated 24 July 2018 from the insolvency
administrator of Alno Aktiengesellschaft (Alno), in which he challenged all payments made by Alno for delivery
of Pfleiderer’s products from 30 June 2014 to 6 July 2017 in a total amount of EUR 19 346 thousand. With
respect to all payments made within three months prior to Alno’s filing for opening of insolvency proceedings
the insolvency administrator argues that they are subject to the three months claw-back right (sec. 130 German
Insolvency Code). With respect to the remaining payments made within four years prior to Alno’s filing for
opening of insolvency proceedings the insolvency administrator argues that they are subject to the claw-back
right for intended damage (sec. 133 German Insolvency Code. Pfleiderer has sent a letter to Alno insolvency
administrator rejecting the claims. Based on the facts known today it is not possible to estimate in a reliable way
if the claim has overwhelming prospects of success and to estimate an amount of the alleged claw-back claim for
which it is more likely than not that Pfleiderer has to pay for. In Q4 2020, Pfleiderer and the Alno insolvency
administrator have entered into settlement discussions. These discussions are still ongoing. In case of a litigation
Pfleiderer and its legal advisors estimated the cost for lawyers and the court and had the provision for Alno and
Wellmann case (described below) in the amount of EUR 1 500 thousand as of 31 December 2020 (EUR
550 thousand as of 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018).

By way of a letter dated 8 December 2020, the insolvency administrator of Gustav Wellmann GmbH & Co.
KG (Wellmann) challenged all payments made by Wellmann for delivery of Pfleiderer’s products from
4 November 2016 to 4 April 2017 in an amount of EUR 2 572 thousand and from 12 April 2017 until 7 July 2017
in an amount of EUR 941 thousand. With respect to all payments made within three months prior to Wellmann’s
filing for opening of insolvency proceedings the insolvency administrator argues that they are subject to the three
months claw-back right (sec. 130 German Insolvency Code). With respect to the remaining payments made
within four years prior to Wellmann’s filing for opening of insolvency proceedings the insolvency administrator

argues that they are subject to the claw-back right for intended damage (sec. 133 German Insolvency Code). On
4 January 2021, by way of a letter sent by its legal counsel to Wellmann’s insolvency administrator, Pfleiderer
rejected the claims. Based on the facts known today it is not possible to estimate in a reliable way if the claim has
overwhelming prospects of success and to estimate an amount of the alleged claw-back claim for which it is
more likely than not that Pfleiderer has to pay for. In Q4 2020, Pfleiderer and the Wellmann insolvency

### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

To PCF GmbH, Neumarkt i.d. Oberpfalz

**REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**Audit Opinion**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of PCF GmbH, Neumarkt i.d. Oberpfalz, and its
subsidiaries (PFLEIDERER PCF GROUP or the Group) which comprise the consolidated statements of financial
position as at 31 December 2018, 2019 and 2020, and the consolidated statements of profit or loss and of
comprehensive income, the consolidated statements of changes in equity and the consolidated statements of cash
flows for the financial years then ended, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a
summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the accompanying consolidated financial
statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRS as adopted by the EU and, in compliance with these
requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at
31 December 2018, 2019 and 2020 and of its financial performance for the financial years 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 German Commercial Code (HGB), we declare that our audit has not
led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements.

**Basis for the Audit Opinion**

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Section 317 HGB and
in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further
described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements” section of
our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of German
commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

**Responsibilities of the Executive Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements**

The executive directors of PCF GmbH are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRS as adopted by the EU and that the consolidated
financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities,
financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for
such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going
concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is
no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error as well as to issue an auditor’s report
that includes our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with Section 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material
misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these consoli- dated financial statements.

F-73


-----

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also

   - identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal controls.

   - obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

   - evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the
reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

   - conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures
are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the
Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

   - evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with
IFRS as adopted by the EU.

   - obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit.
