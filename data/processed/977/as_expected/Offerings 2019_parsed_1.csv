We prepare our annual financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The condensed consolidated interim financial statements as at and for the nine months ended 31 May 2019 were prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34—“Interim Financial Reporting.” There could be significant differences between IFRS and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), as applied to us. We neither describe the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP nor reconcile our IFRS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, such information is not available to investors, and investors should consider this in making their investment decision. Certain comparative amounts as at and for the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 presented in the audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the twelve months ended 31 August 2018 have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. The non-current and current portions of deferred lease liabilities of $0.2 million and $54.8 million, respectively, have been reclassified as separate line items in the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 August 2018. These amounts had been classified under accounts payables and accruals prior to the reclassification. This reclassification does not affect previously reported total equity and profit or loss as at and for the twelve months ended 31 August 2017. Furthermore, in the audited consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended 31 August 2018, the Group changed its definition of Adjusted EBITDA presented as part of segment information to also add back certain costs that were considered to be one-off costs, with an adjustment of $0.6 million of one-off costs made to the comparative segmental information to be consistent with the 31 August 2018 presentation. Financial information as at and for the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 appearing in this Offering Memorandum are based on amounts appearing as comparatives in the audited consolidated financial statements as at for the twelve months ended 31 August 2018 found elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. In this Offering Memorandum, we present financial information on the basis of the segments presented in our Financial Statements. These segments are (i) School Operations, (ii) School Support Services and (iii) Corporate head office and others (“Corporate”). In this Offering Memorandum, we present financial information on the Guarantors’ contribution to revenue, operating profit, and total assets of the Group which is calculated on the basis of each Guarantor’s consolidated operating results and financial condition for the relevant period. In this Offering Memorandum, we also present summary unaudited financial data for the twelve months ended 31 May 2019. The unaudited financial data for the twelve months ended 31 May 2019 has been derived by subtracting audited consolidated statement of profit and loss data for the nine months ended 31 May 2018 from audited consolidated statement of profit and loss data for the twelve months ended 31 August 2018 and adding interim unaudited consolidated statement of profit and loss data for the nine months ended 31 May 2019.

977_1,Offerings 2019.md,26,NOTICE TO INVESTORS,26.3,Certain Material Accounting Changes,26.3.1,,"Certain new accounting standards and interpretations that were not effective as of the date of issuance of our financial statements for periods covered in this Offering Memorandum are disclosed below and will be adopted where applicable when they become effective. For a description of other accounting changes not yet effective see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Condition_ _and_ _Results_ _of_ _Operations—Critical_ _accounting_ _policies—Recent_ _accounting pronouncements.”_ IFRS 16—Leases was issued in January 2016 and replaces IAS 17—Leases. The new standard brings most leases on the statement of financial position for lessees under a single model, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. Under IFRS 16, a lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is treated similarly to other non-financial assets and is depreciated accordingly. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments payable over the lease term, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease if that can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee shall use their incremental borrowing rate. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged and the distinction between operating and finance leases is retained. IFRS 16 is expected to have a significant impact on the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements. On adoption of IFRS 16, we will recognize within the consolidated statement of financial position a right of use asset and lease liability for all applicable leases. Within the consolidated statement of profit or loss, rental- operating leases expense will be replaced by depreciation and finance costs. The standard will also impact a small number of measures such as operating profit and cash generated from operations, and alternative performance measures used by us. The full impact of IFRS 16 is currently under review, including understanding the practical application of the principles of the standard. It is therefore not practical to provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect until this review is complete. We plan to adopt the new standard from the financial year beginning on 1 September 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this Offering Memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way these measures are calculated. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and an investor should not consider these measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results of operations as reported under IFRS. Some limitations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as a measure are that: - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements, for our working capital needs; - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal repayments, in respect of any borrowings; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA may not be indicative of our historical operating results, nor are they meant to be a projection or forecast of future results. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors because these measures allow for an analysis of our core performance which excludes the impact of certain non-operating factors. These measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the stage of growth development, capital expenditure requirements and the jurisdictions in which certain Group companies operate and make capital investments. In addition, we believe that EBITDA is a measure commonly used by investors, analysts and other interested parties in our industry.

977_1,Offerings 2019.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.1,SUMMARY Overview,7.1.1,,"We are the world’s leading provider of private K-12 English-language education by revenues, operating in the UAE and Qatar. We are particularly focused on the UAE, the largest private education market in the world by revenue. Concurrently with the Offering, we are acquiring a 92.9% shareholding in Bellevue Education (“Bellevue”) from an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Varkey Group, one of our indirect shareholders (the “Acquisition”). Bellevue operates 15 schools, of which 14 are in the United Kingdom, and one is in Switzerland. Founded by Mr. Sunny Varkey (the “Founder”) and beginning with a single school in Dubai, we have been a pioneer of the UAE’s education system. As at 31 May 2019, we offered a diverse range of educational choices through 48 schools across three price points, Premium, Mid-Market Plus and Mid-Market, and four curricula, British, Indian, American and International Baccalaureate (“IB”). While over half of our schools teach the British curriculum, our students come from more than 170 countries, with British nationals representing only approximately 2% of our current students. As at 31 May 2019, 123,368 students were enrolled in our schools. In the nine months ended 31 May 2019, students paid tuition fees ranging from $2,000 to $30,000 per student per annum and, for the twelve months ended 31 May 2019, we generated ARPS of $8,494. We also provide a comprehensive range of school support services, including school bus transportation, school uniform sales, sports management services, after-school activities, school catering, school security services and teacher training. We pride ourselves on providing consistently high-quality education and student outcomes, irrespective of a school’s price point, and our students have consistently outperformed their global peers in standardized examinations. For example, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, 93% of our rated schools in Dubai (collectively, “Rated Schools”) were designated as “outstanding,” “very good” or “good” by the KHDA, the Dubai education regulator. As at 31 August 2018, the last period when comparable data was available, only 61% of non-GEMS schools were so rated in Dubai. According to data provided by the KHDA, we had a market share by enrollment in Dubai of 27.3% for the 2018-2019 academic year and our school portfolio had over three times the number of students as the Dubai public education system. Our commitment to providing high quality education through all of our curricula and price points has helped to drive our uninterrupted growth in enrollment and revenues for over 15 years. We have grown enrollment and revenues consistently, including during and after the global financial crisis in 2008, and during periods of regional conflict. From the twelve months ended 31 August 2006 to the nine months ended 31 May 2019, student enrollment grew at a CAGR of 8.1% and school revenue grew at a CAGR of 17.5%, in each case exceeding the CAGR of UAE GDP and the UAE’s population growth of 5.3% and 5.1% over the same period, respectively. In the twelve months ended 31 August 2016, 2017 and 2018, we had revenue of $789.7 million, $926.2 million and $1,022.5 million, respectively. Over the same periods, our Adjusted EBITDA was $212.8 million, $262.2 million and $282.6 million, respectively. In the nine months ended 31 May 2018 and 2019, we had revenue of $904.9 million and $928.0 million, respectively. Over the same periods, our Adjusted EBITDA was $306.0 million and $302.2 million, respectively.

For further information on fee frameworks, see “Regulation Overview—United Arab Emirates.” In addition, we have received permission for exceptional fee increases for the 2019-2020 academic year outside of the KHDA framework in seven schools in total, of which four are in Dubai, two are in Sharjah and one is in Abu Dhabi.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528
977_1,Offerings 2019.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.2,Recent Developments,7.2.5,Start of the 2019-2020 academic year in Indian curriculum-based schools,"In April 2019, our Indian curriculum-based schools started the 2019-2020 academic year. Even though capacity utilization within our Indian curriculum-based schools is the highest in our portfolio, we managed to increase the enrollment where there was capacity to do so. In April 2019 we also merged two schools, Our Own Boys School (“OOB”) and New Our Own English Private School (“EPS”), both mid-market Indian curriculum-based schools, on the site of EPS, in Sharjah. This merger allowed us to better utilize the newer facilities of the EPS site, which was developed during the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. We intend to refurbish the school buildings of the former OOB site into a new mid-market British curriculum-based school at a higher price point, which is scheduled to open in September 2019. We believe that the mid-market British curriculum-based offering is increasingly favored by parents in the UAE over monocultural Indian schooling. In addition, in April 2019 we reduced capacity, and therefore opening enrollment, at the Indian curriculum-based school Our Own Girls School (“OOS”) at the request of that school’s regulator, the Sharjah Private Education Authority (“SPEA”). Concurrently, we secured an exceptional fee increase for this school. In the aggregate, the impact of the merger of OOB and EPS and the reduction of capacity at OOS largely offset enrollment growth in our expanding Indian curriculum-based schools. As a result, we anticipate that the net enrollment in our Indian curriculum-based schools will remain largely flat between the twelve months ended 31 August 2018 and 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

977_1,Offerings 2019.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.2,Recent Developments,7.2.7,Outlook for the twelve months ending 31 August 2020,"As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have largely completed the 2019-2020 academic year re-enrollment campaign for our British, American and IB curricula-based schools. During this campaign, parents are asked to pay a re-enrollment fee in order to be allocated a position in the coming academic year. This re-enrollment fee is generally offset against the coming semester’s tuition fee invoice. On a like-for-like basis, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have secured a higher number of re-enrollment intentions for these schools than at the same date in the prior academic year. In particular, the absolute number of re-enrollment indications, and the percentage of students seeking to re-enroll in our Premium schools segment, is higher than in the prior year. As such we anticipate a lower churn rate in our British, American and IB curricula-based schools than in the prior academic year. Additionally, we continue to market our schools to new students (“new joiners”). We calculate new joiners based on the twelve months ending 30 June. The overall number of new joiners as of 30 June 2019 was slightly ahead of the number of new joiners as of 30 June 2018, and we additionally expect further new joiners to be attracted to our new school GCS, which we intend to open in September 2019. Nevertheless, we anticipate that the number of students in our Premium schools will be modestly lower in the twelve months ending 31 August 2020 than in the twelve months ending 31 August 2019, given subdued volumes of new joiners into the premium segment.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

We believe that we have a long-term track record of, and reputation for, delivering high-quality education. Although most of our students do not use English as their first language, they have consistently outperformed their global peers in standardized examinations across our curricula, including for UK A levels, average IB diploma score, Indian Central Board of Secondary Education (“CBSE”) pass rates and results in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (“TIMSS”). Our graduates have been accepted to all eight Ivy League universities, all of the top 50 UK universities and 1,050 universities in 53 countries. This track record of academic outperformance has strengthened our brand and reputation in our markets, allowing us to fill available capacity at new schools, maintain high levels of student re-enrollment and further improve our academic profile. Our teachers and senior administrative staff are highly qualified and experienced, and are recruited through a rigorous hiring process which we manage centrally. We are one of the largest employers of British, North American and Indian teachers outside of their respective home countries, and in the nine months ended 31 May 2019, we received approximately 65,000 applications for the approximately 1,300 teaching positions we had available, enabling us to be highly selective in hiring staff. This selectivity has allowed us to recruit a diverse and talented teacher base, with teachers coming from over 90 countries and a wide variety of specialist fields. We attract this quantity of high quality teaching applications because of our international scale, strong brand, reputation for quality and competitive compensation packages. We emphasize ongoing professional development through our teacher training program, operated by TELLAL, a GEMS brand and the first fully accredited teacher training institute in the UAE, which is certified to grant teaching qualifications recognized both in the UAE and globally. Over half of our teachers have been with us for more than three years, and our teacher turnover rates are below the industry average for Dubai, and we believe that our commitment to professional development is key to maintaining these strong teacher retention rates. We are a trusted partner for key stakeholders in the education sector, including regulatory bodies, teachers, parents and real estate developers. In particular, our net promoter score (“NPS”) from 4 ----- parents has doubled over the past year to 14, with 37% of our students’ parents scoring their child’s school as a nine or ten out of ten. Our reputation and credibility with these stakeholders provide numerous benefits, including high demand for our services, access to high quality teachers and access to strategically located land for school construction. We benefit from the strategic location of our schools in proximity to residential areas in the UAE. Furthermore, our reputation and relationships with stakeholders provide us with early access to desirable locations for the development of new schools, and our land bank allows us to strategically hold properties at a low cost until the development opportunity matures. Our existing scale, financial resources, operational experience and deep institutional knowledge allows us to better address certain structural hurdles in expanding in existing markets and entering new markets compared to other operators. For instance, significant financial resources are required in order to invest in new school facilities or to acquire existing schools. Our broad experience coupled with our strong understanding of the local markets facilitates our ability to meet legal, financial and other requirements in securing government licenses and regulatory approvals in multiple jurisdictions. Additionally, centralized expertise and local knowledge helps us address the issue of the scarcity of suitable sites in key markets and the tendency of property developers and landlords to prefer operators with a strong track record and financial resources. Our long and positive track record and established reputation underpins our ability to recruit and retain high quality teachers, particularly in expatriate markets.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

In total, the estimated revenue of the UAE private K-12 education market in 2017 was $4.4 billion. In 2018, revenue for the private international K-12 segment was $3.4 billion, and this segment is forecast to grow by approximately 10% per year for the next five years. Of this $3.4 billion, Dubai represented $2.3 billion of the market value and Abu Dhabi represented $1.1 billion. This growth has been driven by several economic and political growth trends, including historic population growth and economic expansion, a young, skilled population, increasing population stickiness, government focus on quality education and ongoing price and cost inflation. The UAE has several structural advantages with respect to the education sector, including: - a high degree of private school penetration in K-12 education; - private schools provide the highest quality of education; - UAE private schools focus on residents, who generally stay longer than non-residents; and - most students in the UAE are young and, because of this, private school enrollments generally ramp up from the lowest grades onwards.

In addition, on completion of the Acquisition, we will also generate revenue through our Bellevue division. Our School Operations division provides a diversified offering across multiple curricula (British, Indian, American and IB) and price points (Premium, Mid-Market Plus and Mid-Market). This diversity of offering expands our addressable market by allowing us to provide offerings that are attractive to parents across a variety of socioeconomic groups. This diversity also decreases our reliance on any one socioeconomic group, thereby decreasing volatility in enrollment numbers.

These Maturing Schools and New Schools are now built and require no further significant investment to maintain current capacity levels. As of 31 May 2019, these schools had an aggregate unfilled capacity of approximately 22,000 seats, leaving substantial room for additional student enrollments without the need for further investment in capacity expansion. Furthermore, ARPS at these Maturing Schools and New Schools are generally higher than those at Mature Schools, even within similar price brackets, reflecting the overall fee inflation across the market. Taken together, these factors are expected to allow Maturing Schools and New Schools to contribute material Adjusted EBITDA growth at minimal incremental cost.

In the last three fiscal years, approximately half of our revenue growth was driven by regulated yearly fee increases, which are in turn dependent (in Dubai, our largest market) on the ECI and the school ratings published by the KHDA. As the ECI for an academic year is published in advance and the DSIB typically publishes school ratings for the upcoming academic year in April or May, we generally have time to plan for the permitted fee levels at each of our schools and manage our cost base accordingly. See “Business—Our Business—The School Operations division— _Tuition fee increases”. For example, we learned in June 2018 that we were not permitted to increase_ fees in our Dubai schools for the following academic year and, as a result, we focused on reducing our cost base in advance of the following academic year. We benefit from strong Adjusted EBITDA margins, which reflect the significant benefits of our scale, our high degree of revenue visibility and our efficient and controlled cost base. Fifteen of our schools began operating between September 2013 and August 2017 (“Maturing Schools”) and three of our schools began operating in September 2017 or later (“New Schools”). Both those schools which began operating prior to September 2013 (“Mature Schools”) and Maturing Schools have grown enrollment year-on-year between the twelve months ended 31 August 2016 and the nine months ended 31 May 2019. Occupancy levels for our Maturing Schools increased year-on-year over the same period. We benefit from low non-discretionary capital expenditures (mainly in relation to maintenance investments and support services, primarily transportation). We enjoy favorable working capital dynamics, due to parents prepaying tuition fees for the upcoming school semester or year, although the year-end position can be impacted by the start date of the new school year. We also benefit from a favorable tax regime, as the UAE does not currently impose income or corporate tax on our business.

To support this strategy, we intend to continue developing our relationships with real estate developers and landlords, who we expect will continue to be key stakeholders in relation to our expansion of capacity at existing schools. We intend to continue to open new schools in the UAE and potentially in other new markets. In the UAE, we intend to open one new school in the twelve months ended 31 August 2020, and will continue developing new schools at greenfield sites at a more moderate rate than in prior years, largely focused on relocation and expansions of existing successful schools. While we have primarily grown organically in our existing markets to date, we may also seek to acquire single schools or portfolios of schools that meet our acquisition criteria, as demonstrated by our acquisition of Wesgreen International School in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 and our ongoing acquisition of Bellevue. We seek to acquire existing schools when there is no overlap with existing GEMS schools, there is an opportunity to improve the school’s operational or financial model and there is scope for school expansion on the existing site. Acquiring existing Mature Schools also allows us to benefit from an immediate, large increase in enrollments without needing to wait for enrollment levels to increase year over year, as we would for a Maturing School or New School. We regularly evaluate opportunities in adjacent markets in the GCC, which are characterized by lower political risk, strong underlying economic growth, large youth populations and a lack of public-sector education provisions.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before one-off costs (including IPO expenses and other one-off costs), gains on disposal of subsidiaries and pre-operative expenses. We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to reflect certain normalization adjustments, the estimated pro forma EBITDA contribution from the acquisition of Bellevue Education, the estimated pro forma rental savings from the repurchase of two school building leases in Qatar and adjustments to add back the negative EBITDA generated by greenfield investments in four new schools during their ramp-up phase. Investors should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA (a) as an alternative to operating profit/(loss) as a measure of our operating performance, (b) as an alternative to net cash outflows or inflows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs or (c) as an alternative to any other measure of performance under IFRS. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this Offering Memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way these measures are calculated. Investors should also note that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as presented above are calculated differently from “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined and used in the Indenture.

The adjustment is based on Bellevue’s historical Adjusted EBITDA for 25 ----- the twelve-month period ended 31 May 2019, adjusted in a manner consistent with the adjustments applied to our Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to the extent applicable. (e) Gives effect to the expected rent savings from the repurchases of the leases relating to two school buildings in Qatar that are currently subject to sale and leaseback arrangements that we expect to complete in conjunction with the Offering, as if such repurchases were completed on 1 June 2018. See “Use of Proceeds.” (f) Reflects adjustment to add back the negative EBITDA generated by our greenfield investments in four new schools that are currently in ramp-up stage and operate at a loss.

These amounts have not been audited, reviewed or verified by an independent accounting firm. Moreover, the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA presented above are based on our current estimates, and they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such pro forma financial information. Some of the factors that could result in the newly acquired or existing schools’ results of operations not achieving the anticipated Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA include the failure to adequately integrate new acquisitions into our network or slower integration than expected, adverse macroeconomic conditions in the regions where the new schools are located, increased competition from local or other international school operators and the failure to retain existing students at the school and/or increase enrollments to meet unfilled capacity. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and _Industry—We may not realize any or all of our anticipated pro forma adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA included in this Offering Memorandum.”_ (2) Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue, expressed as a percentage.

Our consolidated statement of cash flow information only reflects our aggregate capital expenditure.

In addition, as of 31 May 2019, we also had $200.0 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility, which has not been included in gross total secured debt since it is an undrawn commitment.

Factors affecting student recruitment and retention rates include competition from other private education providers (particularly with respect to our Premium schools), our ability to maintain our pricing levels at competitive levels, competition from public sector schools, economic downturns, political instability in the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) region, declines in school academic performance, teacher quality, infrastructure and facilities quality or reputation, a failure to maintain curricula that are attractive to students and parents, or disruptive events which cause a temporary or permanent closure of any of our schools. Each year students leave our schools for a variety of reasons, including expatriate relocations, relocations to other countries to complete their secondary education, enrollment in competitors’ schools and graduation from the highest grade at their school. While we seek to grow our overall student base to support re-enrollment and offset losses by recruiting new students, net enrollment may decline if we are unable to do so. If we are unable to recruit new students and retain current students, our revenue would decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

In the twelve months ended 31 August 2018, 74% and 85% of our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, were attributable to our operations in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. As substantially all of our revenues are derived from our operations in these locations, any changes in the political, social, economic or other conditions in the UAE, particularly events which impact Dubai’s or Abu Dhabi’s attractiveness as jurisdictions in which to do business and as markets for expatriates, as well as any factors that result in a decline in the expatriate population of the UAE, may lead to a significant fall in enrollment demand at our schools, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Although economic growth rates in the UAE remain significantly above those of more developed markets as well as regional markets, the UAE has experienced slowing economic growth in recent years. In addition, the economy of the UAE is heavily dependent on expatriate workers and consumers, and any reduction in their numbers or their compensation or benefits, or increase in the taxes they pay, could materially adversely affect demand for our services. The finances of the federal government and certain of the emirates are highly impacted by revenue from oil and oil-based products, the prices for which declined sharply during the economic crisis and have continued to remain volatile, with significant decreases experienced since 2014, and a period of significant volatility since 2018. In addition to the oil and gas sector, the economy of the UAE, and Dubai in particular, is also exposed to trends in regional and international tourism. There can be no assurance that economic growth or performance in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and the UAE in general, as well as our other markets, will be sustained. If the economies of any of these markets or their major industries suffer a decline, or if government intervention in these economies restricts or limits economic growth, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 31 ----- Demand for our services is also affected by factors relating to education policies and trends in our markets, principally: - the current lack of public education services in languages other than Arabic and for non-national children in the UAE and Qatar, and attendant government policies that encourage the growth of private-sector education; - the trend for nationals in each of the UAE and Qatar to switch from public-sector education to private-sector education; - policies governing tuition fees and other education-related costs; and - demand from parents for high-quality private education for their children. A change in government education policy or education trends among our target client base could reduce the demand for private-sector education, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528
977_1,Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.4,Regulators may limit our ability to increase our fees.,"Tuition fee levels for private schools in the UAE are regulated by the UAE Education Regulators (as defined below). For example, in Dubai, the KHDA regulates, among other things, the annual tuition fee increase applicable to private schools. New private schools are not permitted to increase their tuition fees in the three years following the date of commencement of their educational activity, and existing schools cannot increase fees without first receiving approval from the KHDA. Therefore, pursuant to the “School Fees Framework” which applies to all private schools that have been operating in Dubai for more than three years (including, as at 31 May 2019, 28 of our schools), private schools can only increase tuition fees at a rate based on: (a) the Dubai Education Cost Index (the “ECI”); and (b) a multiplier linked to changes in individual school inspection ratings awarded by the KHDA, with schools securing an upgrade in their ratings being allowed to increase their fees by a pre-determined multiple of the ECI. School inspections focus on factors such as academic performance and class size, and underperformance in any of the factors that are considered during the inspection can lead to a ratings downgrade, which in turn reduces the permitted level of fee increases for the following academic year. The KHDA and other governmental entities can also decide, as they have done on two occasions in the past, that tuition fees cannot be increased for reasons not related to inspection results, such as inflation or general economic conditions. For example, for the 2018-2019 academic year, the Dubai Executive Council decreed that private schools in Dubai were not permitted to increase school fees at all for that year. Furthermore, in the 2013 academic year, the KHDA decided to set the ECI at negative 1% due to low inflation, thereby effectively disallowing tuition fee increases in that year. In both instances, certain exceptional fee increases for individual schools were still permitted. There can therefore be no assurance that the KHDA or any other government organizations will not set the ECI below inflation again in the future, grant any exceptions if it were to do so, or permit future school fee increases. Moreover, the new regulatory framework introduced in Dubai for the 2019-2020 academic year includes new punitive provisions linked to downgrades to Dubai School Inspections Bureau (“DSIB”) inspection outcomes for specific schools, and generally allows lower fee inflation than the prior framework. From the 2019-2020 academic year onwards, Dubai schools that have their ratings downgraded by the DSIB will not be permitted any increase in fees for the following academic year. In addition, while the fees we charge for services provided through our School Support Services division are not currently subject to regulatory limits, there can be no assurance that this will remain the case. The KHDA or another government organization could, in the future, subject ancillary services, such as those we provide through our School Support Services division, to separate fee caps, or take the cost of these services into account when deciding on permitted fee increase levels for schools, which, in either case, could reduce our revenues. In the Northern Emirates, a school rating system based on the Unified Schools Inspection Framework (as defined in “Regulation Overview—United Arab Emirates”) was created in 2018, with the first round of school ratings confidentially sent to schools, but not publicly released, in May 2018. As the 32 ----- Northern Emirates have not used this type of school rating system in the past, the relevant regulators may be less experienced in determining school ratings, and there can be no certainty that our schools will receive ratings which we believe accurately reflect their quality or which are comparable to the ratings of our schools in Dubai or Abu Dhabi. There can be no assurance that other regulatory authorities in the UAE or other jurisdictions in which we operate will not impose restrictions on the level of tuition fees charged by our schools in the future. Changes in such regulations, which can often occur at short notice, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, market revenue growth forecasts are driven in part by expected increases in tuition fee levels. If these increases do not materialize, or grow at a slower rate than expected, the associated market revenue growth forecasts described elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum may not be achieved. If regulators do not grant us permission to raise our tuition fees, or if tuition fee regulatory frameworks are altered in a manner which negatively impacts our tuition fee structure, or if our schools’ ratings are downgraded by the relevant regulator, our operating margins could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Furthermore, we believe that recently the pace at which school operators have been able to secure school ratings upgrades has slowed and the expected management intensity required to secure upgrades has increased. As such, we may not be able to raise the ratings, and therefore the fee levels, of our schools as quickly as we have done in the past. This could impact our revenues, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

However, certain factors could have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain or increase our tuition fees within the permitted regulatory framework. These factors include: - negative perceptions of the quality of education offered at our schools; - resistance to tuition fee increases by tuition payers (parents and employers) due to difficult economic conditions or previous fee increases in recent academic years; - reductions or discounts of tuition fees by other schools that seek to compete with us; - with respect to our Dubai schools, a nil or a negative ECI; - a determination by the KHDA or another government body to restrict fee increases; - the extent of any fee increase implemented in the immediately preceding two years for our schools in Abu Dhabi; and - lower fees at new competitor schools.

Penalties for failing to obtain or comply with the required licenses and/or permits may include fines, civil or criminal actions and temporary or permanent school closures. We are not currently in compliance with the licensing requirements of ADEK and the Abu Dhabi government in respect of the ownerships and/or tenancy arrangements of three of our schools in Abu Dhabi, which accounted for less than 5% of revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended 31 August 2018, as these schools were all established before the current requirements were imposed. Notwithstanding this non-compliance, ADEK has verbally confirmed that it will continue to renew the education licenses and no objection certificates required to operate these three schools, thus effectively granting an indefinite grace period for compliance with these requirements. However, there can be no assurance that this grace period will not be withdrawn. If the grace period were to end, this could result in ADEK not issuing or renewing necessary education licenses and/or certificates, unless the ownership and/or tenancy arrangements relating to these schools could be restructured to ensure compliance with the requirements. In respect of two of these schools, any restructuring is expected to be limited to amending the existing tenancy arrangements. For the third school, compliance would require the transfer of shares to a Local Sponsor and the entry into Local Sponsor Documentation, and there can be no guarantee that this would be achievable prior to the expiry of any grace period. As a separate matter, we must also generally maintain various accreditations from curriculum providers and permits from examination bodies. The loss of these accreditations and/or permits may negatively affect our ability to provide our curricula, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and the attractiveness of our school portfolio and, consequently, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, the jurisdictions in which we operate, in particular the Northern Emirates, may impose additional laws, regulations or licensing regimes which constrain our ability to operate our business or require us to hold additional licenses, permits or accreditations, which could result in our having to incur additional expenses or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Furthermore, our transport activities are regulated by the Roads and Transport Authority of Dubai (the “RTA”) as to safety and standards of service provision in Dubai, and we are required to obtain a license from the RTA for our activities and our drivers.

Our schools compete with other private K-12 English-language schools and other education providers, including providers that offer the same curricula at similar or lower price points. We may also experience increased competition if new private K-12 English-language schools enter our markets, or if the public education provisions in our markets expand in size or increase in quality. Our existing and potential competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development and construction of schools and respond more quickly to changes in parents’ demands, admissions standards, market needs or new technologies. In particular, we are facing increased competition from both local and international operators of schools that compete with our Premium schools, which are typically our most profitable schools. Our competitors may also increase their capacity in any of our markets to an extent that leads to an over-supply of capacity. We may also experience increased competition if the industry undergoes consolidation. Furthermore, if we are unable to meet demand for enrollments at our schools, or if we are unable to shift demand from schools which do not have available capacity to schools with excess capacity, students may choose to enroll in competitors’ schools instead. If we are unable to differentiate our schools from those of our competitors and successfully market our schools to parents and students, we may be unable to attract and/or retain students, which could reduce our enrollment levels and profitability, or we could be required to increase our operational or capital expenditure, including on marketing or educational inputs, to increase or retain enrollment 34 ----- levels. If our enrollments fall, we may be required to reduce our tuition fees or increase spending to attract and retain students. Pricing strategies by competitors, such as lowering fees, could also result in downward pricing pressures on us. Any decrease in fee levels or increase in spending due to competitive pressure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our School Support Services business provides certain services to third parties, and we face competition in the provision of these services, particularly with respect to our transport business, which faces competition from both private competitors and the RTA, which, in addition to acting in a regulatory capacity, also provides a school transport service for education providers in Dubai.

As at 31 May 2019, we had 16 Premium schools. While only 22% of our students were enrolled in Premium schools in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018, these schools generated 49% of the School Operations division’s revenue for the year. Revenue from Premium schools is directly related to enrollment, which can be negatively impacted by a variety of factors, including expatriate relocations, students switching to a competitor’s school and students switching to one of our schools at a lower price point. Our Premium schools are also among our schools that generate the highest Adjusted EBITDA Margins, as they are more likely to be Mature schools with higher enrollment levels and better capacity utilization. In addition, in our experience, Premium schools have historically been subject to lower levels of re-enrollment than Mid-Market Plus and Mid-Market schools, because parents of students at Premium schools are typically more mobile and reside in Dubai for shorter time periods. As such, any decline in Premium school enrollments could have a proportionally higher impact on our revenue and margins than a similar decline in Mid-Market Plus or Mid-Market enrollments. If revenue from our Premium schools were to decline for any reason, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

We hire approximately 1,500 new teaching staff annually to fill new positions and replace teachers who have left. We face competition to attract and retain teachers who possess the necessary experience and accreditation to teach at our schools, particularly in key functions and subjects. In particular, we face intense competition to attract and retain suitably qualified teachers in certain subject areas, such as physics, and for teachers specializing in Arabic language and Islamic studies. Moreover, the introduction of teacher licensing may result in more competition for a smaller pool of licensed teachers across all subjects, and Arabic and Islamic studies teachers in particular, and could result in our teachers who have completed teacher licensing being recruited by competing schools that pay higher salaries. In addition, we may face challenges in attracting teachers for schools located outside of metropolitan Dubai and Abu Dhabi, as schools in smaller cities are generally viewed as less desirable to work in. To effectively compete for and retain staff, we must provide competitive compensation packages. However, we pay salaries and bonus packages which we believe are competitive but not typically market-leading. This has in the past and could in the future affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and/or require us to increase our salary and benefit packages. The average turnover rate of our teaching staff was 20.3%, 19.8% and 15.6% in the twelve months ended 31 August 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Turnover requires us to devote resources to 35 ----- attracting and recruiting new staff. Although we have been able to effectively manage our business with turnover rates in this range, an increase in the turnover rate could adversely affect our ability to attract and recruit sufficient staff in key areas and lead to ineffective delivery of the curricula, which could affect students’ academic performance and the brand and reputation of our schools. Furthermore, our turnover rate may make it more difficult to maintain consistency in the quality of instruction. We have also experienced, and may in the future experience, changes in our school senior leadership teams and senior administrative and senior teaching leadership staff for a variety of reasons, including school restructuring, medical problems, retirement and resignations. Although we use non-competition clauses in our standard employment contracts for staff, these employees may also leave us and subsequently join our competitors. Any turnover in senior staff at a school could adversely affect the management of that school. Any inability by us to recruit, or any shortage of, teaching and senior staff, or a decrease in the quality of teachers’ classroom performance, whether actual or perceived, could reduce the overall quality of education at our schools, which could lead to parents choosing to remove their children from our schools, or a decrease in a school’s rating, which would in turn reduce the amount that that school could increase tuition fees.

However, we will face both short-term and long-term risks in connection with any expansion. In the short term, we face execution risks with respect to the schools we have already chosen sites for and are currently developing. These risks include: - failing to open new schools on a timely basis due to delays in obtaining government approvals or licenses, shortages of supplies and skilled labor, construction accidents or natural disasters; 36 ----- - failing to adequately staff new schools or successfully integrate and retain acquired schools’ teachers, senior staff and other employees; - failing to integrate new schools into our portfolio without disrupting our current operations or diverting management’s attention; - incorrectly estimating demand from parents to enroll their children at a new school; and - the strain on our financial and other resources, management, information and reporting systems and financial controls.

There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to find schools available for sale that satisfy our requirements or, if we do, that we would be able to finance the acquisition costs on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, we may incorrectly evaluate the potential of acquired schools. In addition, we have a significant market share in the UAE. Consequently, we may not be able to grow as quickly in the UAE in the future as we have in the past, either because market opportunities may be more limited and/or regulations are introduced which restrict our ability to expand further in the UAE.

We also acquired the Wesgreen International School, in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017. We may also undertake additional school acquisitions in the future. We have also acquired companies which provide school support services and may undertake additional support services acquisitions in the future. In addition, our shareholder GMHL, in conjunction with joint venture partners, acquired four schools in Egypt and 13 schools in the KSA for which we are responsible for supporting the management. Acquisitions can expose us to integration challenges such as negative parental reactions, additional regulatory scrutiny, system integration challenges, financial or operational performance issues, and cultural challenges, particularly for acquisitions in jurisdictions with which we are less familiar. When we acquire a school, parents of students enrolled at the school may react negatively to the change in ownership, potentially choosing to send their children elsewhere. Consequently, a decrease in enrollment could follow any such acquisition, reducing revenue. A proposed acquisition could also expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny. If a regulator delays, or imposes conditions on, any acquisition, it may prevent the acquisition from occurring or negatively affect the operations and/or profitability of the newly acquired school or business. Furthermore, system integration challenges have arisen in the past and may arise in the future, as the newly acquired school or business is brought into our school portfolio. These challenges can include various obstacles from financial, management information services and human resources perspectives. Our management team may also be required to devote substantial amounts of time to acquire and integrate new schools, which could reduce their ability to focus on other issues. This may be true even for schools outside the Restricted Group that our management team is responsible for supporting, such as the schools acquired by GMHL in Egypt and the KSA. The failure to overcome these challenges could lead to operational problems. In addition, acquired schools could fail to perform as expected, from either a financial or operational perspective.

Therefore, our success depends in large part on the timely and efficient construction of our schools, whether by CMC, a contractor we have historically relied upon and which is controlled by the Founder, or a third party. There are various construction, operating and governance risks associated with the development of new schools in a timely manner or at all. These risks include: - delays or refusals to grant the necessary building, occupancy and other required governmental permits, licenses, approvals and authorizations; - operational, financial (including bankruptcy), regulatory or legal issues impacting a contractor; - shortages of, or defective, materials and/or equipment, labor shortages and/or disputes and disputes with subcontractors; - unforeseeable physical conditions (natural physical conditions or other physical obstructions, including sub-surface and hydrological conditions); - natural disasters and accidents, including force majeure; - changes to the requirements of governmental authorities; - delays in signing lease agreements and finalizing contracts; and - delays caused by governmental authorities or master developers. If a new school is completed beyond a specified contractually agreed deadline, regulators may not grant the licenses necessary to allow the school to open for the scheduled academic year. A delay in the opening of a new school could also lead to other adverse consequences, including delays in student enrollment, missed teaching time, increased teacher and regulatory costs, reputational damage and breached obligations to landlords and master developers in the communities in which the school is to open.

In addition, the cost of construction materials and/or labor may increase, and construction projects may require additional development efforts to ensure their timely completion that may result in significant additional costs. To the extent that these additional costs cannot be recouped through contractually agreed mechanisms, they may result in the expected return on the investment in the school not being realized.

This school accounted for less than 1% of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. There can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfactorily resolve our dispute regarding OOF and agree acceptable lease terms for a new long-term lease with the landlord, which may result in us needing to relocate the school to an alternative site or withdrawing from the school altogether if an economically viable alternative cannot be found. If we must seek alternative lessors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement premises or services on economically attractive terms, on a timely basis, or at all, which could require us to close a school, increase costs and/or disrupt our operations, any of which could harm our reputation, subject us to claims from parents and adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, in certain markets in which we operate such as the UAE, landlords can demand that any improvements constructed by the tenant, such as buildings, be removed from a site upon the termination of a lease. Alternatively, the landlord may be able to pay the tenant compensation for the improvement, although this payment will not necessarily cover the improvement’s full market value. Consequently, it is possible that we will not receive full or any compensation for our improvements to leasehold sites with respect to which leases expire and are not renewed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

Eight of our leases are due to be renewed in the next five fiscal years. In addition, at OOF we are negotiating renewal terms for a lease which has expired, although we continue to operate the school despite an ongoing rental dispute with the landlord. While some of our current leases contain priority renewal provisions which provide that we have the right of first refusal to renew the lease upon the expiration of the lease, subject to a pre-agreed lease rate determination mechanism, this may not always be the case. Under the terms of many of our leases, the lessor’s termination rights are limited. However, there can be no assurance that a lessor will not endeavor to unilaterally terminate a lease prematurely or that the courts will protect our rights in these disputes. If our leases are terminated by a landlord for any reason or are not otherwise renewed on acceptable terms, we may be exposed to certain risks, including: - damages payable to the landlord, if the landlord terminated the lease for cause; - an inability to renew the professional license to operate the relevant school or to find a new property with the amenities and in the location required, which could lead to closure of the affected school(s) or a decline in the breadth of the offering; - the incurrence of costs associated with our obligation to return the land to its original state prior to the construction of our school on the premises; - the incurrence of costs to identify, secure and relocate to a new location, and to develop the new facility to the required standards; - reputational damage; and - the relocation to a school in a less desirable location. In addition, because we have our origins as a family business, the lease of the land for certain of our existing schools has historically been entered into between the relevant landlord and the Founder (“Legacy Leases”). Although most of the Legacy Leases have subsequently been assigned or subleased to the relevant corporate entities within the Group, there are Legacy Leases pursuant to which our schools are operating which have not yet been assigned or subleased to entities within our 42 ----- Group. Accordingly, in respect of these Legacy Leases, the continued use of the relevant land by us is subject to the relevant landlord not terminating the lease and continuing to allow us (rather than the Founder) to use such land.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

Among other challenges, available sites may be too small, prohibitively expensive or subject to zoning restrictions that do not permit school facilities. Furthermore, we face the risk that competitors and other third parties may anticipate and capitalize on potential land acquisition opportunities in advance of us doing so.

We currently operate eight schools on land in respect of which we have registered our real property rights with the DLD (including one on freehold land we own and seven with long-term registered leases). Of these eight, one was subject to a sale and leaseback transaction, and we are currently in the process of registering the transfers to and from the sale and leaseback investor. We also operate two additional schools on land subject to existing long-term leases which can be registered with the DLD, although we have not yet done so, one of which is under re-negotiation with the landlord. In relation to our schools under development in Dubai that are on properties required to be registered with the DLD, we own one freehold plot and lease three additional plots. All of these property interests have been registered with the DLD. Of the three leases, one has recently been terminated, and the remaining two are under re-negotiation with the landlords. We are currently in discussions with the DLD in relation to the registration of the as yet unregistered lease described above. The registration of such lease will trigger liability for payment of a registration fee, the exact quantum of which cannot be determined with absolute certainty and is subject to the assessment of the DLD. The deadline for the registration of the registrable interests set out above has passed and there is a possibility that, in addition to the applicable registration fees, the DLD may seek to impose late penalty fines at the time of registration of the interest by us.

As a matter of UAE law, long-term leases outside such areas may only be entered into with GCC nationals or 100% GCC owned entities. Given that we are not a 100% UAE owned entity, our longterm lease agreements outside these areas cannot be registered with the relevant land departments in the UAE. If any of these long-term lease agreements are challenged, there is a risk that a UAE court could determine that one or more of them are void. In order to mitigate this risk, and due to the fact that a registered lease is required to obtain the relevant commercial and educational licenses for each of our schools, we seek to enter into parallel short-term leases, which can be entered into with foreign companies and registered with the relevant authorities. Although we have taken steps to limit the need to obtain the consent of the underlying landlords to renew these parallel short-term leases, we are dependent on the underlying landlords in respect of long-term leases at five schools, and two land bank sites to renew the relevant parallel 43 ----- short-term leases for us to renew our commercial and educational licenses. At the time of renewal of such parallel short-term leases, we are exposed to the risk that landlords could seek to renegotiate terms agreed in the underlying long-term leases and impose unfavorable terms on us due to their significant negotiating leverage. This could affect our ability to operate the schools subject to these leases on economically attractive terms, on a timely basis, or at all, which could increase costs or cause disruptions to our operations.

In particular, we have registered or are registering 97 trademarks, including “GEMS Education”, and have registered 114 domain names. We rely on trademark protection in selected jurisdictions to protect our rights to the mark “GEMS Education” and our distinctive logos and other marks associated with our services. We cannot be certain that these measures will be adequate, that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protection for all of our proprietary rights in selected jurisdictions or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate our trademarks and brand name. Policing the unauthorized use of our trademarks and brand names can be difficult and expensive, and litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our brand name or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Moreover, some of our trademark or other intellectual property applications may not be successful. If we do not secure registrations for our trademarks or other intellectual property, it may be more difficult to enforce them against third parties. We have entered into the Trade Mark Licence Agreement with GEMS Global pursuant to which GEMS Global is permitted to use the “GEMS” trademarks, logos and designs (the “Marks”) in connection with the operation of schools in certain jurisdictions outside the MENA region in which the Varkey Group currently operates schools under the “GEMS” brand (but excluding India) (“Licensed Schools”). The use of the Marks is subject to certain conditions which include mandatory compliance with our brand guidelines and directions and undertakings not to harm the goodwill of the Marks and/ or use the Marks outside the authorized activities. In addition, the licensing arrangement allows us to protect the Marks through obligations imposed on GEMS Global in relation to the operation of the Licensed Schools and the right to inspect each Licensed School on a regular or ad hoc basis to ensure compliance with such obligations. Nonetheless, we remain subject to reputational risks if the Marks are misused or if there is any adverse publicity through actions taken by or against the ex-MENA business. If this were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Furthermore, GEMS Global is the owner of several “GEMS” registered trademarks in India which it uses in the schools which it operates in India. Its use of the “GEMS” brand is not therefore regulated by the terms of the Trade Mark License Agreement and so there are no conditions attached to its use of the brand in India. The “GEMS” brand is also used by three schools in the UK which are independently governed by the GEMS Learning Trust, an independent academy trust over which we 44 ----- have no control. Any adverse event at these schools could therefore have a material adverse effect on our brand and reputation and could influence the way our business is viewed not only by parents and students, but also by other constituencies in the education sector, including the UAE Education Regulators. Moreover, an event that damages the reputation of one of our schools could adversely affect the reputation and operations of our other schools. If our brand or reputation declines, or if the brand or reputation of certain schools or groups of schools declines, it could lead to a decrease in enrollments at our schools, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, third parties may accuse us of infringing their intellectual property, including their branding. Third party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations without infringing those intellectual property rights. For instance, an unaffiliated third-party school could object to us giving one of our schools a name similar to that third-party school’s name. Any infringement or alleged infringement of intellectual property rights could lead to legal claims or negatively impact our reputation and branding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

The prevailing legal interpretation in the UAE is that the restrictions under the Concealment Law only apply to activities which are strictly reserved for UAE nationals and/or entities wholly owned by UAE nationals under UAE law and licensing requirements, and do not prohibit sponsor arrangements in respect of entities subject to restrictions on foreign ownership in the UAE (the “UAE Ownership Requirement”) if the activities conducted by such entities are not strictly reserved for UAE nationals and/or entities wholly owned by UAE nationals. Although the provision of education services are not strictly reserved for UAE nationals and/or entities wholly owned by UAE nationals, certain of our subsidiaries conduct activities that are reserved for UAE nationals under UAE law (being nurseries, transportation services and labor supply services), and we exercise control over and derive 100% of the economic benefit from such subsidiaries on the basis of sponsor agreements with Local Sponsors. There is a higher risk that sponsor agreements such as these (as compared to sponsor agreements in respect of our subsidiaries conducting activities which are not reserved for UAE nationals and/or entities wholly owned by UAE nationals) may be found to breach the Concealment Law if successfully challenged. Some of these entities are non-revenue generating or loss-making holding companies. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, to our knowledge, the provisions of the Concealment Law have not been enforced against any UAE company, nor are we aware of such arrangements having been unilaterally or in any other manner challenged, by the Government of the UAE or any Emirate thereof. However, there can be no certainty as to the approach that the UAE courts would take in the event of any enforcement action being taken in relation to the application of the Concealment Law or other laws or policies to the Local Sponsor Documentation. There could be a number of adverse implications for us if any aspect of the Local Sponsor Documentation were to be successfully challenged in respect of any of our subsidiaries that are subject to such arrangements, including, among others: - the Local Sponsor Documentation being deemed void, which would result in: - the loss of the right to claim the full economic benefit of the affected operating businesses; - the loss of the right to acquire the shares held by the Local Sponsors in the affected subsidiaries or to require the shares held by the Local Sponsors in the affected subsidiaries to be transferred to a third party; - the loss of our right to be appointed as a proxy for the Local Sponsors during shareholder meetings of the affected subsidiaries; and/or - the loss of the right to prevent the Local Sponsors from selling or transferring their shares in the affected subsidiaries; - the suspension of operating licenses and educational services permits of the affected subsidiaries by the UAE Education Regulators (which could require us to close or suspend the operations of the affected subsidiaries and related activities carried out by them); - having to adopt an alternative ownership or operating structure that could be disadvantageous to us and the affected subsidiaries; or - the imposition of material fines.

In the event of a Local Sponsor who is a natural person passing away, the Local Sponsor Documentation existing between the Group and such person would automatically terminate in accordance with UAE 49 ----- succession law. The assets held by the Local Sponsor would pass to his/her heirs and any shares would remain subject to any protections set out in the articles of association of the relevant company. Where the relevant Local Sponsor is also a landlord under a lease agreement with us, the rights and obligations under the lease agreement will pass to the Local Sponsor’s heirs. For example, since the death of the Local Sponsor and landlord of OOF, we have been in a dispute regarding the ownership of the professional license to operate the school and the terms of a renewal of a long-term lease with the former Local Sponsor’s heir. This school accounted for less than 1% of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. There can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfactorily resolve our dispute regarding OOF and agree acceptable lease terms for a new longterm lease with the landlord, which may result in us needing to relocate the school to an alternative site or withdrawing from the school altogether if an economically viable alternative cannot be found. The risks set out in this Offering Memorandum in relation to the Local Sponsor arrangements within our corporate structure may be increased where we are required to enter into contractual and/or other arrangements with a successor to any of the existing Local Sponsors with which we have no established relationship.

While it is not clear whether the requirement applies only to new arrangements or requires a transition of existing arrangements to the standard form, ADEK’s interpretation and practical application of the Circular is to impose the requirement in relation to all Government land, regardless of the current status of development and nature of the tenant’s interest. ADEK also requires the relevant tenant to be a UAE national and/or a 100% UAE national-owned entity, and only that tenant may hold an ADEK education license. We are not currently in compliance with, and have been deemed by ADEK not to be in compliance with, the requirement to enter into a standard form musataha agreement in respect of three of our schools in Abu Dhabi. One of these schools, The Cambridge High School, is operated by a Third Party Subsidiary that is wholly owned by UAE nationals who are also the joint holders of the relevant education license. The second of these schools, GEMS United Indian School, is operated by a Minority Subsidiary, the shareholders of which hold the relevant education license. We are also deemed by the Al Ain Municipality and ADEK not to be in compliance with respect to Our Own English High School, Al Ain, although the rationale for this is not clear given that the school is situated on private land. These three schools together accounted for less than 5% of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. Notwithstanding this non-compliance, ADEK has verbally confirmed that all necessary education licenses and/or no objection certificates will continue to be renewed, thus effectively granting an indefinite grace period for compliance with these requirements by these three schools. However, there can be no assurance that the grace period will not be withdrawn. If the grace period were to end, this could result in ADEK not issuing or renewing necessary education licenses and/or certificates, unless the ownership and/or tenancy arrangements relating to these schools could be restructured to ensure compliance with the requirements in time. If required, we intend to complete any required restructuring. The Cambridge High School in Abu Dhabi and Our Own English High School in Al Ain are already held by Third Party Subsidiaries and compliance is therefore expected to be limited to amending the existing lease arrangements. GEMS United Indian School in Abu Dhabi is currently held by a Minority Subsidiary and compliance, among other things, would require it to be held by a Third Party Subsidiary. However, a failure to complete any required restructuring in order to comply with ADEK’s requirements prior to the expiry of this grace period could lead to ADEK not issuing or renewing necessary education licenses and/or certificates in respect of the relevant school(s). 50 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

See “Summary—Summary Financial and Operating Information—Operating Data and Non-IFRS Financial _Information.”_ Each of the adjustments is based on our current estimates, and involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future results. In particular, the pro forma adjustments intended to give effect to the full year impact on our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended 31 May 2019 of the acquisition of Bellevue Education, which we expect to complete in conjunction with this Offering (see “Use of Proceeds”), is based upon financial information, including budgeted data, that was made available to us in connection with the acquisition together with our management’s assumptions and estimates. Therefore, we have included in this Offering Memorandum certain financial information related to the schools that is based on estimated figures for such periods which have been prepared by their previous management together with external advisors in connection with the acquisition process. Moreover, these schools have historically been operated by separate entities and, as such, their historical financial performance may not be indicative of their financial performance both on a standalone basis and within our Group. The Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has not been reviewed by our auditors and the adjustments and assumptions used in preparing the metrics may prove to be inaccurate or may be affected by other factors that have not been accounted for. The Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or be used as a substitute for an analysis of the operating results of our Group and no undue reliance should be made in respect of such information.

The transactions may not be completed for any number of reasons, including, among others, default by the sellers under the purchase agreements or memoranda of understanding, as applicable, or failure by us or them to meet the relevant conditions for any such transaction. We have also made further adjustments based on a number of assumptions related to the impact to EBITDA of our greenfield investments in four new schools that are currently in ramp-up stage and negative EBITDA.

The forms of this unrest vary from public demonstrations to, in extreme cases, armed conflicts, and have given rise to increased political uncertainty across the region. This, combined with the continuing state of unrest in Syria and Iraq and the rise of ISIS, have further exacerbated the risk of a larger regional conflict or acts of terrorism in the region. In addition, in June 2017, the KSA, the UAE, and Bahrain, together with certain other states in the MENA region, moved to cut diplomatic ties, as well as 52 ----- trade and transport links with Qatar (the “Qatar developments”). More recently, in June and July 2019, there has been a resumption of tensions between Iran and other countries over the Strait of Hormuz, which is located in the direct vicinity of the UAE. Regional unrest has implications for the wider global economy and may negatively affect market sentiment towards other countries in the region, including the countries in which we operate. Such unrest may also have negative implications on securities issued by companies operating in the region, including those in the UAE. It is not possible to predict the occurrence of events or circumstances such as war or hostilities, or the impact of such occurrences. The occurrence of any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Although the UAE has not been directly adversely affected by the surrounding unrest, this continuing instability may significantly impact the UAE, including both its financial markets and the real economy. Such impacts could occur through a lower flow of foreign direct investment into the region, emigration of expatriate residents, capital outflows or increased volatility in the global and regional financial markets. Regional volatility could also lead to higher refugee population inflows to the UAE, which the country might not be able to easily absorb, leading to increased social unrest. Furthermore, while the Qatar developments have not affected our operations to date, there can be no assurance that this will continue to be true. If, and to the extent that, this regional volatility leads to an outflow of expatriate residents or capital, or to potential instability or government change in the UAE, Qatar or any other country in which we operate or begin operating, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

While the supply of education and education-related goods and services are generally subject to UAE VAT at the zero rate, the standard rate of 5% applies on certain school support services and real estate services. Moreover, in consultation with professional advisors, we have applied UAE VAT to certain services in accordance with our understanding of the regulatory framework. However, as the UAE VAT is newly introduced and our application and interpretation has so far been untested, there can be no certainty that our application will not be subsequently challenged, or that the federal tax authority will not seek to recover VAT for certain services, or fine us for perceived failures to appropriately levy VAT. We have accounted for VAT (where applicable) and included UAE VAT in our prices where relevant, in respect of the goods and services that we provide in the UAE. Over time, this may result in a decrease in utilization rates and/or demand. Furthermore, given that the services we provide are largely zero-rated and we typically are in a VAT refund position, any delay in the processing of UAE VAT refunds could adversely impact our cash flows. In addition, any imposition of a tax on corporate earnings could also reduce our net profit. Although the individual Emirates where we operate do not impose corporate tax, and at the federal level, the UAE currently does not impose corporate tax on the education sector, there have been periodic and recent discussions about introducing a federal corporate tax regime in the UAE. Any change in UAE tax laws or a significant increase in tax rates could reduce our net profits. With regard to our operations in Qatar, although Qatar is a signatory to the GCC Common VAT Framework Agreement, it does not currently implement VAT. However, Qatar generally imposes a 10% income tax on corporate earnings generated in Qatar. Other tax obligations include, for instance, a requirement to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-resident persons and an obligation to comply with Qatari transfer pricing regulations. Any change in the Qatari tax laws, their interpretation or enforcement by the Qatari tax authorities, or an increase in tax rates, could adversely impact our net profits. Furthermore, we are in the process of acquiring Bellevue, which operates schools in the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Once the Acquisition completes, we will have operations, and generate revenue, in these locations. As such, we will be exposed to tax obligations in these countries. Both the United Kingdom and Switzerland impose corporate taxes, which could reduce our net profit.

To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, various interest rate benchmarks (including LIBOR) are the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011). In addition, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned by the FCA as a result of the absence of relevant active underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of regulatory reforms) for market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. On November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the Working Group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of SONIA reference rates. A public consultation was launched in July 2018 in relation to specific queries related to the operations of SONIA reference rates. On April 23, 2018, the Bank of England took over administration of SONIA and issued a series of reforms as part of its implementation as a replacement to LIBOR. From April 2018, the Bank of England has been setting the interest rate benchmark using SONIA, meaning that banks are no longer compelled by the FCA to submit LIBOR rates beyond 2021. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to, the Senior Facilities whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

As of 31 May 2019, after giving effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, on a consolidated basis, our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes would have had $31.5 million in outstanding debt. Moreover, the Indenture does not prohibit us from constituting or acquiring new subsidiaries and such subsidiaries may not be required to become Guarantors under the Notes. Additionally, the Indenture provides for a Notes Guarantee to be released in certain circumstances. Unless any such future subsidiary of the Issuers becomes a Guarantor, such subsidiary will not have any obligation to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. The Indenture, subject to some limitations, will permit our future non-Guarantor restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial amounts of indebtedness, and such indebtedness could be secured, subject to the applicable lien capacity, and additionally, the Indenture will not restrict the amount of other liabilities that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

The Notes Guarantees, security interests and other obligations will also be subject to applicable corporate and other laws. In general, these laws prohibit companies from providing financial assistance to anyone for the purpose of acquiring their shares and limit the circumstances in which companies can transfer economic benefits to their shareholders outside the payment of properly declared dividends. They also provide for limitations that affect the rights of creditors generally in case an entity becomes insolvent.

Moreover, certain transaction documents that are governed by U.S. law judgments rendered by a U.S. court will generally not be directly enforceable in any of the jurisdictions in which the majority of the assets by which the Notes are secured are located. Instead, in many of these jurisdictions, as a pre-condition to enforcing a U.S. judgment, a local court will subject the judgment to a multi-factor test. Several of the factors the court will consider involve a considerable amount of discretion. And even if the court ultimately finds that the judgment is enforceable, the process may take a lengthy amount of time to complete.

Not all of our assets secure the Notes and we will not be obligated to take action to perfect all liens on assets that do secure the Notes. If we default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral underlying their security interest. See “—The _Notes will not be initially guaranteed by any of the Guarantors or secured by all of the Collateral.” We_ may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which may also be secured by the Collateral. Your rights to the Collateral may be diluted by any increase in debt secured by the Collateral on a similar or more favorable basis to the Notes or a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes. If the value of the Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Notes together with the claims of the other secured creditors, those claims may not be satisfied in full. Furthermore, the Collateral may also secure certain additional indebtedness in the future on a super priority basis, pursuant to the terms and limitations set forth under the Indenture. If any such super senior indebtedness is incurred after the Issue Date, in the event of an enforcement of the Collateral, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after such super senior indebtedness has been repaid in full. As a result, holders of the Notes may receive less in an enforcement or insolvency scenario than if they were not required to share the proceeds. No appraisals of any of the security have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the Offering. The fair market value of the security is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, our ability to implement our business strategy, the ability to sell the security in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of any security would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the security at such time, general, market and economic conditions and the timing and the manner of the sale. There also can be no assurance that the security will be saleable and, even if saleable, the timing of any liquidation or foreclosure is uncertain. To the extent that liens, rights or easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property owned by us, such third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such liens that could adversely affect the value of the security and the ability of the 59 ----- Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the security. In addition, the share pledges of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. By the nature of our business, some or all of the security may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the security is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and other senior secured obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the security will be sufficient to pay the obligations due under the Notes. In the future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a particular type or class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries, the designation of a previously unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary or otherwise, are subject to the Agreed Security Principles and, in the case of the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to require granting of, or payment or enforcement under, a guarantee or security in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any guarantee or security provided by any subsidiary being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets.

As a result of the voting provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, under certain circumstances, the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging arrangements could have effective control of all decisions with respect to the collateral securing the Notes. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent serves as a common security agent for the secured parties under the Senior Facilities Agreement, certain hedging obligations and the Notes. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the Security Agent will act with respect to such collateral only at the direction of an “Instructing Group”. The holders of the Notes will not have separate rights to enforce the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will not be able to instruct the Security Agent, force a sale of Collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the Security Documents, unless they comprise an Instructing Group which is entitled to give such instructions. Disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes and creditors under the Senior Facilities, the counterparties to certain hedging arrangements or holders of any permitted additional indebtedness as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the collateral. In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any decisions of the Instructing Group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the Collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to such holders. The creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreements, the counterparties to certain hedging arrangements or the holders of certain other permitted additional indebtedness may also have interests that are different from the interest of holders of the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant security documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” These arrangements could result in the enforcement of the Collateral in a manner that results in lower recoveries by holders of the Notes.

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens or if it has been agreed that such perfection steps shall not be taken on the basis that such steps have undesirable effects. For the avoidance of doubt, the Security Agent will not have any obligation to take any steps or actions necessary to perfect any such liens. Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taker over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor and there has occurred an event of default under 61 ----- the Indenture.

The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In insolvency proceedings, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors, the security providers or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Notes Guarantees and Collateral, and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds.

However, there can be no assurance as to what methodology a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or each security provider and whether a court would give effect to such attempted limitation.

Depreciation of the euro or U.S. dollar against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments.

If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, the Senior Facilities Agreement or other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuers to receive cash from the Restricted Group to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our then existing financial resources or the restrictions in the Senior Facilities Agreement or other indebtedness. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from 65 ----- providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to repay or refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon occurrence of a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuers to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture. To the extent such default is not cured or waived within the applicable grace period, such default may, subject to the provisions set out therein, result in a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control.” The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indenture.

The schools are strategically located in residential catchment areas and are categorized into the following three price points based on a number of factors, including quality of facilities, average class size and tuition fees charged: - Premium schools, which from the lowest grade to the highest grade typically charge tuition fees of between $15,000 and $30,000 annually per student. Our Premium schools (16 as at 31 May 2019) provide access to each of the four curricula offered by us and accounted for 49.2% of the School Operations division’s revenue in the nine months ended 31 May 2019; - Mid-Market Plus schools, which from the lowest grade to the highest grade typically charge tuition fees of between $5,000 and $15,000 annually per student. Our Mid-Market Plus schools (12 as at 31 May 2019) provide access primarily to the British curriculum, with a limited number offering the Indian or American curricula, and accounted for 21.3% of the School Operations division’s revenue in the nine months ended 31 May 2019; and - Mid-Market schools, which from the lowest grade to the highest grade typically charge tuition fees of between $2,000 and $7,000 annually per student.

As at 31 May 2019, we offered a diverse range of educational choices through 48 schools across three price points, Premium, Mid-Market Plus and Mid-Market, and four curricula, British, Indian, American and International Baccalaureate (“IB”). While over half of our schools teach the British curriculum, our students come from more than 170 countries, with British nationals representing only approximately 2% of our current students. As at 31 May 2019, 123,368 students were enrolled in our schools. In the nine months ended 31 May 2019, students paid tuition fees ranging from $2,000 to $30,000 per student per annum and, for the twelve months ended 31 May 2019, we generated ARPS of $8,494. We also provide a comprehensive range of school support services, including school bus transportation, school uniform sales, sports management services, after-school activities, school catering, school security services and teacher training. We pride ourselves on providing consistently high-quality education and student outcomes, irrespective of a school’s price point, and our students have consistently outperformed their global peers in standardized examinations. For example, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, 93% of our rated schools in Dubai (collectively, “Rated Schools”) were designated as “outstanding,” “very good” or “good” by the KHDA, the Dubai education regulator. As at 31 August 2018, the last period when comparable data was available, only 61% of non-GEMS schools were so rated in Dubai. According to data provided by the KHDA, we had a market share by enrollment in Dubai of 27.3% for the 2018–2019 academic year and our school portfolio had over three times the number of students as the Dubai public education system. Our commitment to providing high quality education through all of our curricula and price points has helped to drive our uninterrupted growth in enrollment and revenues for over 15 years. We have grown enrollment and revenues consistently, including during and after the global financial crisis in 74 ----- 2008, and during periods of regional conflict. From the twelve months ended 31 August 2006 to the nine months ended 31 May 2019, student enrollment grew at a CAGR of 8.1% and school revenue grew at a CAGR of 17.5%, in each case exceeding the CAGR of UAE GDP and the UAE’s population growth of 5.3% and 5.1% over a comparable period, respectively.

As a result, our results of operations are, and will continue to be, affected by macroeconomic and political developments in or affecting Dubai and the UAE and, in particular, the impact of such developments on the demand for private K-12 English-language education. Demand is driven by factors including overall population growth, particularly among expatriates (who comprised over 88% of the population of the UAE in 2018, growth in the number of children in the UAE, the average length of time 76 ----- expatriates stay in the UAE, GDP and net income growth, the lack of a public schools provision for expatriate children in the UAE, the trend of UAE nationals switching from public-sector schooling to private-sector international schooling (since it was first permitted in 2015) and the desire among parents for high-quality private education for their children. Weaker economic conditions in the UAE generally result in both lower increases in student enrollments and higher attrition as a result of students leaving our schools, either as their parents leave the country, or through enrollment into competing schools. Together, lower gross enrollment and higher attrition can result in lower rates of net enrollment growth or net enrollment losses. In addition, lower demand also impacts our ability to raise the fees we charge. We have not had a decrease in net enrollments in any single year since 2003. We believe that the importance that parents place on education, the relative resilience shown by expatriate flows among our parent base during difficult economic conditions, and the relative price and value proposition of our schools compared to our competition have contributed to resilience in net enrollments. During the periods under review, economic growth in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and the UAE as a whole has resulted in a growing overall population and growth in the number of children attending schools in the UAE, as well as an increasing average length of stay in the region for expatriates. This economic environment, together with the growing demand for private K-12 English-language education, has helped to drive the increase in our student enrollments from 104,200 in the twelve months ended 31 August 2016 to 114,644 in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 to 119,616 in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018 to 123,368 in the nine months ended 31 May 2019.

977_1,Offerings 2019.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.6,Key factors affecting revenue,17.6.2,Tuition fees,"Our primary source of revenue is school tuition fees, which make up most of our School ARPS. School ARPS was $6,640 in the twelve months ended 31 August 2016, $7,074 in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017, $7,419 in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018 and $6,528 in the nine months ended 31 May 2019. Expansion in School ARPS accounted for approximately half of overall revenue growth in the School Operations division between the twelve months ended 31 August 2016 and the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. We have discretion to set the level of tuition fees at our new schools upon commencement of operations based on commercial considerations. Thereafter, we are permitted by our regulators in Dubai and Abu Dhabi to increase school tuition fees periodically according to a regulated framework. In Dubai, annual fee increases are regulated by the KHDA under the School Fees Framework and are generally linked to two factors: an annually-adjusted inflation benchmark, the ECI, and the rating that a school receives from the KHDA. The ECI is determined annually by the Dubai Statistics Centre (the “DSC”) and is based on historically observed inflation in the costs of operating a school, as determined by the DSC. The ECI is typically comparable to the DSC’s assessment of inflation in the consumer price index (CPI). The applicable ECI is typically announced in advance of an academic year, allowing school operators to communicate fee increase guidance to parents prior to seeking parental re-enrollment intentions. The ECI is generally announced in advance of the following academic year, allowing school operators to communicate fee increase guidance to parents in advance, and typically prior to seeking parental re-enrollment intentions. The ECI was 2.9% for the 2015–2016 academic year, 3.2% for the 2016–2017 academic year and 2.4% for the 2017–2018 academic year. In the 2018–2019 academic year, school operators in Dubai were not permitted to increase school fees. In April 2019 the ECI for the following 2019-2020 academic year was announced as 2.07%. Prior to the twelve months ended 31 August 2019, the School Fees Framework permitted schools to raise fees by a multiplier of ECI linked to the then-prevailing DSIB of the school. This generally allowed us to raise fees by an amount in excess of inflation. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, we had six schools with an “outstanding” rating, six schools with a “very good” rating, 11 schools with a “good” rating and two schools with an “acceptable” rating. Schools which have been in operation for three years or less are not rated, and as such, four of our schools have not yet been rated or are pending review. Our average multiplier for each of the twelve months ended 31 August 2016, 2017 77 ----- and 2018 was 1.6x ECI (calculated on an unweighted simple average basis). Between the twelve months ended 31 August 2016 and the twelve months ended 31 August 2018 we were generally able to pass on the maximum permitted fee increase under the School Fees Framework, with only one exception at one of our schools in Dubai in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017, when we chose to maintain fees for school-specific reasons in that school. Between the twelve months ended 31 August 2016 and the twelve months ended 31 August 2018, our School ARPS growth exceeded the UAE CPI as a result of the strong aggregate rating performance of our UAE schools. Prior to the 2019 revision, the School Fees Framework permitted schools to raise fees by a multiplier of ECI linked to the then-prevailing DSIB score of the school. This generally allowed us to raise fees by an amount in excess of inflation. Following the 2019 revision, the multiplier is driven by whether the school has achieved positive or negative changes in its rating from the DSIB. The multiplier is structured to incentivize school operators to invest in their schools in order to raise their ratings. If a school’s rating is upgraded, it can increase fees by the multiplier set out in the table below. If the school’s rating is downgraded, the school will not be able to increase fees by any amount in the coming year. The following table sets out the multiplier applicable to various ratings movements:",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

First, tuition fees are higher in more senior grades across all our schools, regardless of the ECI or rating. For example, the tuition fee charged for a student entering GEMS Wellington International School in KG1 was approximately $14,800 per annum for the 2018– 2019 academic year, whereas the tuition fee for a student entering the 12[th] grade was approximately $25,500. Second, the average grade of students across our portfolio has risen year-on-year within the review period. We develop new schools to accommodate junior grades initially, and subsequently provide capacity for more senior level grades as the student population matures. Our student population is generally young. As at 31 May 2019, the average grade of our students was 4.7, and the average grade of students at our Maturing Schools and New Schools was 3.9 and 2.7, respectively. Between September 2013 and February 2019, we opened 18 schools. We expect that an additional school will be opened in September 2019. Newly opened schools primarily attract kindergarten and junior grade students in their first years of opening. This has meant that these newer schools have student bodies which are more heavily skewed towards junior grades than our Mature Schools. In each year, as these schools mature, younger students graduate through grades in the school, and the average student body ages.

We view tuition fee increases associated with the ECI as an opportunity to ensure that the operational cost inflation we experience can be passed on to customers, either in part or in whole, thus supporting our operating margins. Tuition fees for our schools in other jurisdictions are reviewed periodically. In Abu Dhabi, fee increases for the 2019-2020 academic year will be granted based on two factors: the Abu Dhabi Education Cost Index (“ADECI”) (set at 2.31% in the 2019-2020 academic year) and a school’s rating, with higherrated schools able to increase fees by a greater multiple of the ADECI. An exceptional fee increase regime also exists in Abu Dhabi. In Sharjah, Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah, private schools are required to request proposed fee increases directly from the UAE Ministry of Education. Any proposed fee increases are subject to the maximum permitted increase of 10% one year after the last increase, 20% two years after the last increase and 30% three years after the last increase. In addition to fee increases pursuant to the various fee frameworks, UAE regulators will consider applications for exceptional fee increases (subject to certain conditions laid out in the fee framework). We have secured exceptional fee increases on a number of occasions across various Emirates since the introduction of the fee framework. In advance of academic year 2019-2020, we have secured exceptional fee increases in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah. In Dubai, we have secured exceptional fee increases for four of our schools; Al Khaleej National School, where we are permitted to raise fees by 21.4% over the course of three years; Kindergarten Starters, where we are permitted to raise fees by 9.45% over the course of two years; The Westminster School Dubai (“TWS”) where we are permitted to raise fees by 4.0% over the 78 ----- course of the next year; and Our Own Indian School (“OIS”), where we are permitted to raise fees by 9.74% over two years. In Abu Dhabi, we are permitted to raise fees by 18.35% for OOL, Al Ain over the course of the next year. In Sharjah, we are permitted to raise fees by 10% for the coming academic year for both Our Own Boys School, Sharjah, and Our Own Girls School.

School tuition fees per student range from $2,000 to $30,000 per year, with schools in the Mid-Market price point typically charging fees of between $2,000 and U.S.7,000 annually per student, schools in the Mid-Market Plus price point typically charging between $5,000 and $15,000 annually per student, and schools in the Premium price point typically charging between $15,000 and $30,000 annually per student. As such, School ARPS for students will typically be highest for students at Premium schools, followed by students at Mid-Market Plus schools and then Mid-Market schools. Moreover, fees in our Maturing Schools and New Schools are generally higher than those in our Mature Schools, even within the same price point. This is because initial fee levels at newly opened schools are not subject to regulation, while yearly fee increases are subject to regulation. School ARPS in the nine months ended 31 May 2019 for our Mature Schools was $6,746, compared to a School ARPS of $9,683 for Maturing Schools and $7,895 for New Schools in the nine months ended 31 May 2019.

While the majority of the School Support Services division’s revenue is generated through offering services to our students, certain services are also provided to third parties. Fees for these services are dependent on both the level of service provided (with higher fees for higher price points), and demand for the individual service, which can vary across price points. For instance, school bus transportation services are particularly dependent on Mid-Market enrollments, as this business sees the highest utilization from students enrolled in schools at this price point.

We recognize revenues over the ten months of a year when our schools are in session, between September and June. However, our business incurs costs, including teaching salaries, over a twelve-month period throughout the year. We recognize six months of revenue and costs in the first half of our fiscal year, from 1 September until 28 February, but only approximately four months of revenues against six months of costs in the second half of our fiscal year, from 1 March to 31 August. Accordingly, our revenues are generally higher in the first half of our fiscal year than in second half. We typically generate an operating loss during the summer months of July and August when our business generates low revenues but pays salaries. As such, Adjusted EBITDA margins in the first half of our fiscal year are generally higher than those in the second half. For example, our Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33% in the six months ended 28 February 2018 and 19% in the six months ended 31 August 2018. In addition, our British and IB curriculum-based schools require tuition fees to be paid in three yearly installments, our American curriculum-based schools require tuition to be paid in two yearly installments and our Indian curriculum-based schools generally require monthly tuition payments. In all of the curricula, tuition fees are required to be paid in September, as that is the start of the school year for the British, American and IB curricula-based schools, and a month in which payment is due for the Indian curriculum-based schools. However, to the extent that parents pay fees in advance in August, they will be accounted for in the previous fiscal year, whereas fees that are paid in September are accounted for in the following fiscal year.

School staffing expense is driven by two primary factors—individual teacher compensation and the number of teachers employed relative to the number of students, typically expressed as the Pupil Teacher Ratio (“PTR”), which is calculated at the period end. As part of our commitment to hiring and retaining highly qualified staff, we benchmark teaching salaries to both home-country and UAE pay levels. Our compensation packages for teachers typically include housing, provision of school services to teachers’ children and airfare allowances as well as statutory end of service benefits. Relocation benefits are paid when recruiting from overseas. We have also historically operated a long-term incentive plan for teachers which offers cash payments to our longer-term teaching employees. 81 ----- Staff costs comprised 62.2%, 62.8%, 63.5%, 67.1% and 66.4% of the School Operations division’s expenses for the twelve months ended 31 August 2016, 2017 and 2018 and the nine months ended 31 May 2018 and 2019, respectively.

In each of the twelve months ended 31 August 2016, 2017 and 2018 and the nine months ended 31 May 2019, we have grown overall enrollment levels at both Maturing Schools and New Schools. We incur certain fixed costs relating to the operation of our business each year, regardless of student enrollment levels. Enrollment of additional students in schools which have available capacity does not increase fixed costs, principally rent, as well as head office costs, and only marginally increases semifixed costs such as general and administrative costs, resulting in lower average costs per student and higher potential profits. As such, the utilization rate of our schools is a key driver of revenue and profit margin. The total capacity at our schools increased by 20,506 places between 1 September 2015 and 31 May 2019, due to the establishment of seven new schools, the extension of nine existing schools and the relocation of two schools.

Schools are initially lossmaking when they are first built, due to pre-operative expenses, as well as comparatively high fixed costs which are offset by a small enrollment base. However, as the school matures and enrollment and utilization increases, profitability increases. This occurs in part because increasing enrollments lead to more favorable starting utilization levels, including PTRs, while fixed costs remain relatively unchanged and pre-operative expenses are absorbed. As such, opening new schools is accretive to revenue, but initially dilutive to profitability. Expansions to existing schools have a similar effect, although the dilution in profitability is mitigated by these schools’ existing enrollment base. 83 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

During the planning and construction phases, these projects increase our capital outlays, although we construct our schools in phases, with a primary school constructed first, followed three to four years later by a secondary school, to reduce the initially required capital outlay. When the projects are completed, the additional capacity provided by the construction or expansion allows us to increase our enrollments and therefore our revenues. We expect to open one school in September 2019 and another in September 2020, with additional schools to open in the following years.

In addition, we also raised $200 million through the issuance of subordinated perpetual certificates (the “Certificates”) in November 2013. Payments under the Certificates are recorded in our accounts to equity as preferred dividends.

Our enrollment grew across all price points, and in both our Mature and Maturing Schools, with the fastest growth in our Maturing Schools, where enrollment grew by 5,145 students. New schools were a key driver of enrollment growth, as at the beginning of the twelve months ended 31 August 2017, we opened four new schools, GEMS Founders (British curriculum, Mid-Market), GEMS Winchester Fujairah (British curriculum, Mid-Market), GEMS Nations Academy (American curriculum, Premium) and GEMS Al Barsha National School for Girls (British curriculum, Mid-Market Plus), and acquired Wesgreen International School in Sharjah (British curriculum, Mid-Market Plus). The acquisition of Wesgreen International School contributed over 3,500 additional student enrollments. We classify Wesgreen International School as a Mature School, as it was opened prior to 2014. We also completed extensions of seven existing schools, resulting in capacity expansion of 16,219 places in the period. After opening in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 and operating 87 ----- successfully for one year, we merged GEMS Nations Academy with GEMS American Academy, an existing premium American curriculum school in time for the start of the following academic year. Despite our growth in enrollment, our overall capacity utilization declined in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 to 87% from 90% in the twelve months ended 31 August 2016, as capacity grew at a greater pace than enrollment during the year due to the number of new school openings and extensions of existing schools. We grew enrollment by 4,972 students, or by 4.3%, from 114,644 students in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 to 119,616 students in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. Our enrollment grew across all price points, and in Mature Schools, Maturing Schools and New Schools. Enrollment growth was strongest in our Mid-Market Plus price point, with a 6.5% increase, and was strongest in our Maturing Schools, which accounted for 21.2% of the new enrollments in the period. Capacity increased by 10.2%, or 13,552 seats, during the same period, increasing from 132,407 seats to 145,959 seats. The primary drivers of new capacity during the twelve months ended 31 August 2018 were the opening of two new schools with 5,220 seats, GEMS National School for Boys, Dubai (British, Mid-Market Plus) and GEMS New Our Own English Public School, Sharjah (Indian, Mid-Market). These capacity expansions were offset by the impact of merging GEMS American Academy and GEMS Nations Academy, which decreased capacity for our Premium price point segment in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. Capacity utilization contracted, from 87% in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 to 82% in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018, due to the new capacity added during the period outstripping the rise in enrollments during the period. We grew enrollments by 3,655 students, or 3.1%, from 119,713 students in the nine months ended 31 May 2018 to 123,368 students in the nine months ended 31 May 2019. Our enrollment grew across our Mid-Market Plus and Mid-Market price points, and in Mature, Maturing and New Schools. Enrollment growth was strongest in our Mid-Market price point, with a 4.8% increase, and was strongest for our New Schools, which grew by 1,441 enrollments, from 422 enrollments to 1,863 enrollments. During the same period, we grew capacity by 0.6%, or 872 seats, due to the opening of two schools, GEMS Founders Mizhar (British, Mid-Market) and GEMS Our Own English Private School, Sharjah (Indian, Mid-Market), as well as by further expanding a number of existing schools. In combination, the addition of new enrollments outstripped new capacity in the period, resulting in capacity utilization increasing from 82% to 84%. 88 ----- The following tables set out data on revenue, School ARPS and certain other contributors to pricing:",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

The increase in School Operations revenue by $119.1 million, or 17.2%, from $691.9 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2016 to $811.0 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 was primarily driven by the increase in enrollment of 10,444 students, which was primarily due to new school openings, capacity enhancement in existing schools and the Wesgreen International School acquisition, as described above, and to a lesser extent the 6.5% increase in School ARPS from $6,640 per student in the twelve months ended 31 August 2016 to $7,074 per student in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017. Growth in School ARPS in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 was driven primarily by fee inflation linked to academic performance, as we fully passed on the 3.21% increase in the ECI during the period. During the period, our average ECI multiplier for Dubai schools was 1.6x, reflecting the number of outstanding, very good and good schools in our portfolio. School ARPS also benefitted from a positive mix effect through a higher contribution from Mid-Market Plus and Premium school revenue at a higher price point than the average. Finally, grade aging also had a positive impact in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 as the weighted average grade in our schools expanded from grade 4.5 in the twelve months ended 31 August 2016 to grade 4.6 in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017, although the increase was offset in part by the dilutive effect of doubling enrollments during the period. School Operations revenue increased by $76.4 million, or 9.4%, from $811.0 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 to $887.4 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. Revenue growth was broadly equally split between enrollment growth and pricing growth, with School ARPS increasing by 4.9% during the period. Revenue growth was strongest in Maturing Schools, where revenues grew by 17.1%, mostly due to the 20.9% growth in enrollment. The Mid-Market Plus and Mid-Market price points grew by a combined $54.3 million, accounting for over two-thirds of school revenue growth. Premium revenues grew by 5.1%, despite only modest net enrollment growth in the period. 89 ----- We grew School Operations revenues by $15.8 million, or 2.0%, from $789.6 million in the nine months ended 31 May 2018 to $805.4 million in the nine months ended 31 May 2019. While student enrollments increased during this period, they were also adversely affected by a negative mix shift, as our Premium school enrollments declined by 783 students, or 2.9%, over the same period. The decline in Premium enrollments was largely driven by decreases in four of our 16 Premium schools. We attribute the contraction in enrollments in these schools to a combination of weaker macroeconomic conditions in the UAE and increased competition within this price segment. The impact of the associated decline in revenue in the Premium segment largely offset the positive revenue impact of additional enrollment in other segments during the same period. We were also adversely affected by the decision by the Dubai Executive Council to not allow private schools to raise fees in the twelve months ended 31 August 2019, resulting in lower than anticipated revenue growth in the period. _School Support Services division_ We grew revenue from the School Support Services division by $18.4 million, or 16.8%, from $109.2 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2016 to $127.6 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017, and further increased it by $52.9 million, or 41.5%, to $180.5 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. Revenue from School Support Services decreased by $5.9 million, or 4.0%, from $149.2 million in the nine months ended 31 May 2018 to $143.3 million in the nine months ended 31 May 2019. During the periods under review, school transportation revenues represented the majority of the School Support Services division’s revenues. The increase in revenue in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 was attributable to an increase in the number of students served, primarily in the transport business, as a result of enrollment growth, and further growth in average prices charged. Overall penetration rates grew during the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 in the transport business as well. Moreover, during the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 we reported a contribution from Threads for the first time following its acquisition in 2017. The increase in revenue in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018 was broadly equally attributable to a continued expansion of our school transport business user base, in line with overall growth in student numbers, and an expansion in revenues from our other support services businesses. In addition, we recorded income from Hamilton Aquatics and Infracare for the first time as part of our revenues for the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. Infracare largely services our own schools, and as such its revenue contribution is largely eliminated in consolidation. The decrease in revenue in the nine months ended 31 May 2019 was due to lower inter-segment revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

In the twelve months ended 31 August 2017, the increase in staff costs in the School Operations division was driven primarily by an increase in teaching headcount of 794 staff in the period. The increase in staff resulted from new school openings and capacity expansions, as well as the addition of 252 teachers who joined us following the acquisition of Wesgreen International School during the period. PTRs decreased from 17.3 in the twelve months ended 31 August 2016 to 16.8 in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017. 91 ----- Staff costs in the School Support Services division increased in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017, mainly due to the acquisition of Threads, as well as an increase in the number of school bus drivers during the period. In the twelve months ended 31 August 2017, we continued to reduce staff costs in our Corporate division, both in absolute terms and relative to revenue. In the twelve months ended 31 August 2018, the increase in staff costs in the School Operations division was primarily attributable to an increase in teaching headcount by 439 staff, primarily in Maturing Schools, as well as the impact of one-off incremental pay award increases for teaching staff at Indian curriculum-based schools, and restructured salary and compensation packages for our Arabic and Islamic studies teachers. PTRs decreased from 16.8 in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 to 16.5 in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. Staff costs in the School Support Services division increased in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018, primarily due to the acquisitions of Hamilton Aquatics and Infracare and an increase in other support services staff in line with the increase in enrollments. Corporate staff costs increased in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018, due to increased corporate staff levels in preparation for the IPO as well as costs and investments in IT systems. In the nine months ended 31 May 2019, the increase in staff costs in the School Operations division was primarily attributable to an increase in teaching headcount of 180 staff, primarily in Maturing and New Schools. PTRs increased from 16.5 in the nine months ended 31 May 2018 to 16.6 in the nine months ended 31 May 2019 as we started to achieve operational leverage from enrollments in Maturing and New Schools. Staff costs in the School Support Services division decreased in the nine months ended 31 May 2019, primarily due to lower projects revenue for our facility services business. Corporate staff costs increased in the nine months ended 31 May 2019, due to increased headcount. _Other education and administrative expenses_ The following table sets out our other education and administrative expenses:",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

This reflected increased rent payable on existing escalating rent contracts, and lease expense associated with the opening of four new schools and the Wesgreen International School acquisition, which was acquired during the period. Rental cost increases in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 were largely offset by the repurchase of three school buildings in Dubai which were previously leased under a sale and leaseback arrangement. We acquired these leases from the landlord for a total consideration of $159.8 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017. Rental costs increased by $5.4 million, or 7.3%, from $74.2 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 to $79.6 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. This increase was due to the impact of the leases for New Schools and escalating rents under existing leases in line with their contractual terms. School Support services rent increased because of the acquisition of Hamilton Aquatics and Infracare. Rental costs increased by $2.5 million, or 4.2%, from $59.9 million in the nine months ended 31 May 2018 to $62.4 million in the nine months ended 31 May 2019, due to contractual rental increases during the period and the opening of one new school in September 2018. _Depreciation, impairment and amortization_ Depreciation, impairment and amortization increased by $29.7 million, or 58.1%, from $51.1 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2016 to $80.8 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017, and further increased by $1.9 million, or 2.4%, to $82.7 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. Depreciation, impairment and amortization increased by $11.4 million, or 20.3%, from $56.2 million in the nine months ended 31 May 2018 to $67.6 million in the nine months ended 31 May 2019. These increases were primarily attributable to corresponding increases in our depreciable assets over the period reflecting additions and expansions of schools, fittings and fixtures. In addition, in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017, we incurred an impairment charge of $13.3 million, arising from the write-down of the residual value of buildings owned on the formerly leased site of GEMS Dubai American Academy. 93 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

Net finance costs increased by $20.2 million, or 97.6%, from $20.7 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2016 to $40.9 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017. The increase in finance costs was due primarily to a $16.3 million increase in term loan interest and a $8.0 million unwinding of deferred and contingent consideration in 2017. Net finance costs increased by $14.2 million, or 34.7%, from $40.9 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 to $55.1 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. The increase in finance costs was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of loan arrangement fees. Amortization of loan arrangement fees includes an amount of $11.5 million which represents the unamortized portion of the loan arrangement fee on a previous senior facility. We repaid the previous senior facility during the twelve months ended 31 August 2018 and, as such, the related unamortized portion of the loan arrangement fee was charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. The increase in net finance costs was partially offset by a $7.2 million decrease in the unwinding of deferred and contingent consideration relating to the acquisition of Wesgreen International School. Finance income, which relates to income received from GEMS Global under a shareholder loan, remained broadly flat during the period. Net finance costs increased by $12.9 million, or 30.6% from $42.1 million in the nine months ended 31 May 2018 to $55.0 million in the nine months ended 31 May 2019, reflecting an increase in overall borrowings, as well as an increase in relevant base rates in the period.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

In particular, the standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, as of the date of issuance of our consolidated financial statements as at and for the twelve months ended 31 August 2018 include the following. IFRS 16—Leases was issued in January 2016 and replaces IAS 17—Leases. The new standard brings most leases on the statement of financial position for lessees under a single model, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. Under IFRS 16, a lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is treated similarly to other non-financial assets and is depreciated accordingly. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments payable over the lease term, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease if that can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee shall use their incremental borrowing rate. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged and the distinction between operating and finance leases is retained. IFRS 16 is expected to have a significant impact on the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements. On adoption of IFRS 16, we will recognize within the consolidated statement of financial position a right of use asset and lease liability for all applicable leases. Within the consolidated statement of profit or loss, rental- operating leases expense will be replaced by depreciation and finance costs. The standard will also impact a small number of measures such as operating profit and cash generated from operations, and alternative performance measures used by us. The full impact of IFRS 16 is currently under review, including understanding the practical application of the principles of the standard. It is therefore not practical to provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect until this review is complete.

While population growth is expected to moderate, expatriates are staying longer and having more children in the region, thereby driving the growth of student-aged children in the region.

The average tuition fee per student is expected to grow at a 4% CAGR from 2017 to 2023, boosted by an increased contribution from more expensive curricula and the student grade aging effect. Dubai’s education market is supported by the “Vision 2021” initiative, which is intended to pave the way for Dubai’s transition to becoming an international hub for knowledge-based activity, innovation and sustainable industrial activities. Vision 2021 sets out a number of education-related targets, including: - all schools, universities and students to be equipped with “smart” systems and devices; - significant investments to promote enrollment in preschools; - improve rank in reading, mathematics and science examination scores, and have a strong knowledge of the Arabic language; - elevate the rate of graduation from secondary schools to international standards; and - all schools to have exceptional leadership and internationally accredited teaching staff. The government of Dubai has also announced a commitment to improving education outcomes for Emiratis, including through the increased use of private schools. 2015 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (“TIMSS”) scores show that Emiratis in private schools, whether using the British or MoE curriculum, perform better than Emiratis in MoE public schools. This commitment to increasing the enrollment of Emiratis in private schools is expected to drive increased penetration of Emiratis in private schools, from 56% in 2017 to 66% in 2023. We estimate that if the number of students in international private K-12 schools continues to grow at a 4% CAGR from 2017 to 2023, and utilization stays constant at 90%, this will require the market to add an additional 80,000 seats of capacity, or approximately 30 to 40 new schools based on the current average size of Dubai schools. 108 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

As at 31 May 2019, we offered a diverse range of educational choices through 48 schools across three price points, Premium, Mid-Market Plus and Mid-Market, and four curricula, British, Indian, American and International Baccalaureate (“IB”). While over half of our schools teach the British curriculum, our students come from more than 170 countries, with British nationals representing only approximately 2% of our current students. As at 31 May 2019, 123,368 students were enrolled in our schools.

We pride ourselves on providing consistently high-quality education and student outcomes, irrespective of a school’s price point, and our students have consistently outperformed their global peers in standardized examinations. For example, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, 93% of our rated schools in Dubai (collectively, “Rated Schools”) were designated as “outstanding,” “very good” or “good” by the KHDA, the Dubai education regulator. As at 31 August 2018, the last period when comparable data was available, only 61% of non-GEMS schools were so rated in Dubai. According to data provided by the KHDA, we had a market share by enrollment in Dubai of 27.3% for the 2018–2019 academic year and our school portfolio had over three times the number of students as the Dubai public education system. Our commitment to providing high quality education through all of our curricula and price points has helped to drive our uninterrupted growth in enrollment and revenues for over 15 years. We have grown enrollment and revenues consistently, including during and after the global financial crisis in 2008, and during periods of regional conflict.

Even though capacity utilization within our Indian curriculum-based schools is the highest in our portfolio, we managed to increase the enrollment where there was capacity to do so. In April 2019, we also merged two schools, Our Own Boys School (“OOB”) and New Our Own English Private School (“EPS”), both mid-market Indian curriculum-based schools, on the site of EPS, in Sharjah. This merger allowed us to better utilize the newer facilities of the EPS site, which was developed during the twelve months ended 31 August 2018. We intend to refurbish the school buildings of the former OOB site into a new midmarket British curriculum-based school at a higher price point, which is scheduled to open in September 2019. We believe that the mid-market British curriculum-based offering is increasingly favored by parents in the UAE over monocultural Indian schooling. In addition, in April 2019 we reduced capacity, and therefore opening enrollment, at the Indian curriculum-based school Our Own Girls School (“OOS”) at the request of that school’s regulator, the SPEA. Concurrently, we secured an exceptional fee increase for this school. In the aggregate, the impact of the merger of OOB and EPS and the reduction of capacity at OOS largely offset enrollment growth in our expanding Indian curriculum-based schools.

Although most of our students do not use English as their first language, they have consistently outperformed their global peers in standardized examinations across our curricula, including for UK A levels, average IB diploma score, Indian Central Board of Secondary Education (“CBSE”) pass rates and results in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (“TIMSS”). Our graduates have been accepted to all eight Ivy League universities, all of the top 50 UK universities and 1,050 universities in 53 countries. This track record of academic outperformance has strengthened our brand and reputation in our markets, allowing us to fill available capacity at new schools, maintain high levels of student re-enrollment and further improve our academic profile. Our teachers and senior administrative staff are highly qualified and experienced, and are recruited through a rigorous hiring process which we manage centrally. We are one of the largest employers of British, North American and Indian teachers outside of their respective home countries, and in the nine months ended 31 May 2019, we received approximately 65,000 applications for the approximately 1,300 teaching positions we had available, enabling us to be highly selective in hiring staff. This selectivity has allowed us to recruit a diverse and talented teacher base, with teachers coming from over 90 countries and a wide variety of specialist fields. We attract this quantity of high quality teaching applications because of our international scale, strong brand, reputation for quality and competitive compensation packages. We emphasize ongoing professional development through our teacher training program, operated by TELLAL, a GEMS brand and the first fully accredited teacher training institute in the UAE, which is certified to grant teaching qualifications recognized both in the UAE and globally. Over half of our teachers have been with us for more than three years, and our teacher turnover rates are below the industry average for Dubai, and we believe that our commitment to professional development is key to maintaining these strong teacher retention rates. We are a trusted partner for key stakeholders in the education sector, including regulatory bodies, teachers, parents and real estate developers. In particular, our NPS from parents has doubled over the past year to 14, with 37% of our students’ parents scoring their child’s school as a nine or ten out of ten. Our reputation and credibility with these stakeholders provide numerous benefits, including high demand for our services, access to high quality teachers and access to strategically located land for school construction. We benefit from the strategic location of our schools in proximity to residential areas in the UAE. Furthermore, our reputation and relationships with stakeholders provide us with early access to desirable locations for the development of new schools, and our land bank allows us to strategically hold properties at a low cost until the development opportunity matures. Our existing scale, financial resources, operational experience and deep institutional knowledge allows us to better address certain structural hurdles in expanding in existing markets and entering new markets compared to other operators. For instance, significant financial resources are required in order to invest in new school facilities or to acquire existing schools. Our broad experience coupled with our strong understanding of the local markets facilitates our ability to meet legal, financial and other requirements in securing government licenses and regulatory approvals in multiple jurisdictions. Additionally, centralized expertise and local knowledge helps us address the issue of the scarcity of suitable sites in key markets and the tendency of property developers and landlords to prefer operators with a strong track record and financial resources.

These Maturing Schools and New Schools are now built and require no further significant investment to maintain current capacity levels. As of 31 May 2019, these schools had an aggregate unfilled capacity of approximately 22,000 seats, leaving substantial room for additional student enrollments without the need for further investment in capacity expansion. Furthermore, ARPS at these Maturing Schools and New Schools are generally higher than those at Mature Schools, even within similar price brackets, reflecting the overall fee inflation across the market. Taken together, these factors are expected to allow Maturing Schools and New Schools to contribute material Adjusted EBITDA growth at minimal incremental cost.

In the last three fiscal years, approximately half of our revenue growth was driven by regulated yearly fee increases, which are in turn dependent (in Dubai, our largest market) on the ECI and the school ratings published by the KHDA. As the ECI for an academic year is published in advance and the DSIB typically publishes school ratings for the upcoming academic year in April or May, we generally have time to plan for the permitted fee levels at each of our schools and manage our cost base accordingly. See “—Our Business—The School Operations division—Tuition _fee increases”. For example, we learned in June 2018 that we were not permitted to increase fees in_ our Dubai schools for the following academic year and, as a result, we focused on reducing our cost base in advance of the following academic year. 116 ----- We benefit from strong Adjusted EBITDA margins, which reflect the significant benefits of our scale, our high degree of revenue visibility and our efficient and controlled cost base. Fifteen of our schools began operating between September 2013 and August 2017 (“Maturing Schools”) and three of our schools began operating in September 2017 or later (“New Schools”). Both those schools which began operating prior to September 2013 (“Mature Schools”) and Maturing Schools have grown enrollment year-on-year between the twelve months ended 31 August 2016 and the nine months ended 31 May 2019. Occupancy levels for our Maturing Schools increased year-on-year over the same period. We benefit from low non-discretionary capital expenditures (mainly in relation to maintenance investments and support services, primarily transportation). We enjoy favorable working capital dynamics, due to parents prepaying tuition fees for the upcoming school semester or year, although the year-end position can be impacted by the start date of the new school year. We also benefit from a favorable tax regime, as the UAE does not currently impose income or corporate tax on our business.

We also intend to relocate and transplant certain existing schools to new locations, as this can allow existing schools to be redeveloped on sites with greater expansion capacity and also resets the baseline fee level for existing schools which, due to the regulatory cap on yearly fee increases, are below the current market rate for a school of that type. To support this strategy, we intend to continue developing our relationships with real estate developers and landlords, who we expect will continue to be key stakeholders in relation to our expansion of capacity at existing schools.

In the UAE, we intend to open one new school in the twelve months ended 31 August 2020, and will continue developing new schools at greenfield sites at a more moderate rate than in prior years, largely focused on relocation and expansions of existing successful schools. While we have primarily grown organically in our existing markets to date, we may also seek to acquire single schools or portfolios of schools that meet our acquisition criteria, as demonstrated by our acquisition of Wesgreen International School in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 and our ongoing acquisition of Bellevue. We seek to acquire existing schools when there is no overlap with existing GEMS schools, there is an opportunity to improve the school’s operational or financial model and there is scope for school expansion on the existing site. Acquiring existing Mature Schools also allows us to benefit from an immediate, large increase in enrollments without needing to wait for enrollment levels to increase year over year, as we would for a Maturing School or New School. We regularly evaluate opportunities in adjacent markets in the GCC, which are characterized by lower political risk, strong underlying economic growth, large youth populations and a lack of public-sector education provisions.

In each instance, the curriculum offered is supplemented by the specific national requirements of the relevant local education regulator: - British curriculum: typically based on the National Curriculum for England and Wales (the “NCEW”), with examinations based on the General Certificate of Secondary Education (“GCSE”), international GCSE and A Level standards. We also offer a hybrid British/UAE bilingual curriculum in two schools; - Indian curriculum: typically based on the CBSE curriculum; - American curriculum: typically based on the U.S. “common core” state standards. We also offer a hybrid U.S./UAE curriculum targeted at UAE nationals in one school; and - IB curriculum: typically based on a curriculum set by the International Baccalaureate organization. As well as stand-alone IB curriculum-based schools, we also offer senior students in certain of our Indian and American curricula-based schools the opportunity to complete their senior school (i.e. between the ages of 16 to 19) via the IB curriculum. For further information on our curriculum accreditations, see “—Accreditations and affiliations.” We also provide management services to two government schools on behalf of the Royal Family of Abu Dhabi, which teach the UAE national curriculum. Across our schools, our curriculum is guided by detailed and demanding government standards and internationally-recognized requirements that specify what students should know and be able to do at the end of each academic year in various fields of study. Our diverse school offerings reflect the demographic diversity and nationality mix of the UAE, and Dubai in particular. As at 31 May 2019, our students came from more than 170 countries. The majority of our currently enrolled students are citizens of South Asian nations, principally India and Pakistan, or from the wider Middle East region, including the UAE. These students attend a mix of curricula and, as at 31 May 2019, approximately 45% of our British curriculum-based school enrollment comprised South Asian nationals, and a further 37% were nationals from the Middle East, including the UAE. British nationals made up only approximately 2% of our overall student enrollment, and only 5% of our British curriculum-based school enrollment. The parents of our students are employed in a wide variety of sectors. As at 31 May 2017, no single employer represents more than 5% of our students’ parents, based on our analysis, with banking and financial services (15%), airlines, travel and hospitality (13%) and government (11%) representing the three largest employment sectors. Irrespective of nationality, many of our students have long-standing familial roots in the UAE. According to surveys we undertook in May 2017, 80% of our students’ parents have resided in the UAE for over five years, and 67% have resided in the UAE for over nine years. We believe that a significant proportion of our students were born in the UAE. 125 ----- The graph below shows the duration that parents of our students have resided in the UAE, based on a survey we undertook in May 2017:",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

This gradual increase has primarily been driven by three factors. First, Maturing Schools and New Schools continue to add more students in higher grades over time, as a high proportion of students who enroll in early grades 126 ----- typically stay with the school and rise through a grade level each year. Secondly, even in Mature Schools, the average tenure of student, and therefore the average grade within each school, has continued to increase year on year, due to a trend in parents staying longer in the UAE. Finally, our Maturing Schools and New Schools continue to add more students as they open new grades above their initial year K-6 plan. As at 31 May 2019, this trend was partially offset by an above average number of younger pupils joining our schools, particularly in Kindergarten and Year 1 classes of new schools we have recently opened.

977_1,Offerings 2019.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.51,Enrollment Mix by Division and Weighted Average Student Grade,18.51.2,"Enrollment, re-enrollment and churn","Year over year movements in net enrollments are a function of the number of students re-enrolling, and the number of new joiners to our schools. We have consistently increased our total net enrollment every year since 2003, even during periods of global or regional macroeconomic or geopolitical stress. We have high visibility over student enrollment indications for an upcoming academic year, well before the start of that year. _Re-enrollment_ We initiate our re-enrollment campaign for British, American and IB curricula-based schools in February, well ahead of the start of the academic year in September, and begin accepting payment for the upcoming academic year from April onwards. We charge a fee to re-enroll, which is generally offset against the next year’s tuition fees. Because parents pay a fee to do so, we believe re-enrollment indications are a good indication of parental intent. Re-enrollment for Indian curriculumbased schools occurs in April, at the start of that curriculum’s academic year. Re-enrollment accounts for the significant majority of the student population base in any year. Therefore, the combination of early re-enrollment indications and the earlier start of the Indian curriculum-based schools gives us visibility on the trajectory of the next year’s total enrollment levels. At the end of the 2018-2019 academic year, around 3.6% of our students graduated from the highest grade in their respective schools. The size of our graduating class has grown year over year as our student body becomes larger and more mature. After the deduction of graduating students, around 80% of students rejoined us for the subsequent 2019-2020 academic year, which we define as re-enrollment. Re-enrollment levels have consistently been around 80% in the British, American and IB curricula-based schools, and are slightly higher in Indian curriculum-based schools. Within those non-graduating students who did not re-enroll in one of our schools for the 2019-2020 academic year, we believe approximately two-thirds left the country, typically because their parents’ circumstances changed. Approximately one-third of students who did not re-enroll left to join competitor schools. Rises in our churn rate between the 2016-2017 academic year and the 2018-2019 academic year are largely attributable to an increase in the number of students who left the country. _New joiners_ We seek to offset the impact of students leaving our schools by recruiting new joiners throughout the course of the academic year, filling places both for the current academic year (intra-year joiners) and for the start of the following academic year (inter-year joiners). Typically, our new joiners are joining the GEMS school system for the first time, either as young students entering in kindergarten or early years sections, or as students joining from another country following the relocation of their parents to our markets. Some students also join us from competitor schools in the markets in which we operate. The number of new joiners at our schools has grown every year, and the number of new joiners recruited during the twelve months ended 31 August 2018 was the highest we have ever enrolled. We enrolled 29,303 new joiners (inter-year and intra-year) in the 2016-2017 academic year, 31,934 new joiners in the 2017-2018 academic year and 33,519 new joiners in the 2018-2019 academic year.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

In 2018, 81% of GEMS students achieved this level, compared to 67% for the UK average. Our students also exceeded UK averages at A Level during the period, with 32% achieving A*/A grades in 2018, compared to 26% for the UK average. These results were achieved even though 95% of our British curriculum students are non-British nationals, with the majority of these students identifying English as a non-mother tongue language. Similarly, students studying the IB curriculum achieved average test scores that exceeded worldwide averages during the same period, with 2018 being the best year on record, when our students achieved average final points mark of 33 versus 30 worldwide.

Increases in School ARPS are driven by the following three primary factors: _Tuition fee inflation_ School operators in Dubai and Abu Dhabi have generally been permitted by their respective regulators to increase school tuition fees periodically to account for inflation. In Dubai, school tuition fees are regulated by the KHDA based on two factors: an annually-adjusted inflation benchmark, the ECI, and a multiplier. In advance of the twelve months ended 31 August 2019, the Dubai Executive Council announced that school operators would not be permitted to increase fees for the following year. Prior to the 2019 revision, the KHDA framework permitted schools to raise fees by a multiplier of ECI linked to the then-prevailing DSIB score of the school. This generally allowed us to raise fees by an amount in excess of inflation. Following the 2019 revision, the multiplier is driven by whether the school has achieved positive or negative changes in its rating from the DSIB. The multiplier is structured to incentivize school operators to invest in their schools in order to raise their ratings. If a school’s rating is upgraded, it can increase fees by the multiplier set out in the table below. If the school’s rating is downgraded, the school will not be able to increase fees by any amount in the coming year. 129 ----- The following table sets out the multiplier applicable to various ratings movements:",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

Therefore, the number of ratings is not equal to the number of schools. ADEK awards ratings based on a number of factors, principally the quality of a school’s educational offering. Schools can be rated “Outstanding,” “Very Good,” “Good,” “Acceptable,” “Weak” or “Very Weak.” Two of our rated Abu Dhabi Emirate schools were rated “Very Good” (American and IB curriculum), with the rest being rated “Good” (three schools with British curriculum, one school with Indian curriculum and one school in Al Ain (a municipality of Abu Dhabi) with British and Indian curricula). In addition, ADEK also conducted a parent survey in September 2017 for each of our schools in Abu Dhabi (including Al Ain) across four different criteria: parent-school partnership, school safety, 128 ----- teaching effectiveness and physical environment. According to the survey, our schools ranked above all other schools in Abu Dhabi on all of these criteria and our school in Al Ain ranked above all other private schools in Al Ain on three out of four of the criteria. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, ADEK are currently undertaking a new round of surveys, although there is no known publication date. School ratings are made public and have a significant impact on our ability to attract and retain students, as well as teachers. We also believe that our ratings support recognition for our brand as a leading educator. Improved rating outcomes are also an important indicator to evaluate the effectiveness of our continued investment in educational quality. In addition, in our largest market, Dubai, the amount by which we are able to increase tuition fees at each of our schools on an annual basis depends in part on the ratings achieved by our schools. See “—Tuition fee increases” below. Our two Northern Emirates schools (Our Own Fujairah and GEMS Westminster Fujairah) have not historically been subject to a structured inspection regime, although this changed in 2018, as the Northern Emirates are implementing a school rating system based on the Dubai regulatory framework, and although we have privately been informed of the likely ratings for these schools, no rating for any schools in the Northern Emirates has yet been made public.

We consider the following to be the key factors driving school choices for parents: - the quality of teachers and the curriculum; - the school’s reputation; - the school’s location; - the school’s rating provided by the relevant regulators (the KHDA, ADEK or the MOE); - the overall educational and pastoral environment that each school creates for our students; - academic record; - campus quality and overall facilities; and - value for money. 131 ----- We believe that these factors are central to the reputation of our schools and the high standard of education we provide, and are supported by the following initiatives: _An academically rigorous educational and co-curricular program_ We strive to meet the individual needs of each of our students. Each curriculum is designed to comply with the relevant internationally recognized requirements, and is adapted to meet local regulatory requirements, culture and customs, particularly additional UAE-specific curriculum components. We use an integrated IT platform that can be customized for each student. It allows each school to track the performance of our students on an individual basis as well as to benchmark their performance within the school and across our school portfolio. Students are tracked across 88 parameters, based on the KHDA assessment framework. We believe that this enhances the tracking of our students’ academic performance by giving teachers, parents and students an accurate measure of individual progress across a range of metrics. In addition, this platform allows clear learning objectives to be set and monitored within the classroom and on a school-wide basis. Further, the IT platform creates accountability among faculty members and drives consistency in instruction by applying comparable metrics across our school portfolio. In addition to the rigorous approach to classroom-based learning, through our e-Sports and Academy Plus offerings, we operate sporting and academic co-curricular activities during and after school across our schools that provide a supplementary informal learning environment for students as well as additional revenues for us. See “—The School Support Services division.” _Highly qualified principals, teachers and administrative staff_ We demonstrate our commitment to premium quality education by hiring and retaining highly qualified principals, teachers and administrative staff. We use a range of strategies to identify, select and employ our staff. We recruited approximately 1,300 new teachers in the nine months ended 31 May 2019 in anticipation of academic year 2019-2020. These additions were made to accommodate new teaching positions in Maturing Schools and New Schools, as well as to replace teachers who had left. We have a dedicated in-house team dealing with academic recruitment. We receive a substantial number of teaching job applications, receiving almost 65,000 applications in the nine months ended 31 May 2019. We require our teachers to be fully qualified with formal teaching qualifications. Teachers typically have prior teaching experience in national or international schools before joining. As well as recruiting teachers globally, we also train new teachers and offer professional development for current teachers through our teacher training division, TELLAL. TELLAL is fully accredited to grant teaching qualifications recognized both in the UAE and globally. It also generates third party revenues from offering training and accreditation services to other school groups in the UAE. As at 31 May 2019, we employed 3,345 teachers in British curriculum-based schools, 2,900 teachers in Indian curriculum-based schools, 640 teachers in American curriculum-based schools and 556 teachers in IB curriculum-based schools. We believe we are among the world’s largest private sector employers of British and Indian curriculum teachers, and that our scale and global visibility with teachers assists in our ability to attract and recruit new staff. As part of our commitment to hiring and retaining highly qualified staff, we benchmark teaching salaries to both home-country and UAE pay levels, and pay salaries which we believe are competitive but not typically market-leading. Our compensation packages for teachers typically include housing and airfare allowances as well as statutory end of service benefits. We also operate a long-term incentive plan for teachers, “Share our Future,” which offers cash payments to our longer-term teaching employees. Furthermore, teachers receive concessions on tuition fees for their own children enrolled in our schools. Salaries in the UAE and Qatar do not incur income tax. In the nine months ended 31 May 2019, our staff costs were 66.4% of our total operating expenses. We believe that turnover rates for our teachers are similar to overall turnover rates for expatriates in the UAE, with turnover rates for teachers at our schools being 20.3%, 19.8% and 15.6% in the twelve months ended 31 August 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Furthermore, we believe that our teacher turnover levels are lower than average in the K-12 international schools market, which we believe to be approximately 20 to 25%. As at 31 May 2019, over 53% of our teachers had been with us for at least three years, while 24% had been with us for six or more years. 132 ----- Our schools have clear policies for professional development that set out the main responsibilities and entitlements for staff at all levels. In each school, a member of the senior leadership team is responsible for strategy, planning, implementation and evaluation of the professional development of our staff. To maintain consistency, the same member of the senior leadership team typically oversees the staff performance management and appraisal processes, through which individual objectives and development plans are framed and monitored. We regularly and rigorously review the performance of our principals and teaching staff to ensure that their performance meets our high standards. Principals and teachers also benefit from various continuing professional development initiatives, including those provided by TELLAL, which are designed to foster career progression and to improve the quality of our administrative and teaching staff. _High quality school facilities_ Our school facilities, such as science laboratories, sports facilities, computer, music and theatre resources, enhance the educational experience of our students, with additional facilities being offered at higher price points. In addition, the majority of classrooms, irrespective of school price point, use interactive computerized white boards that facilitate students’ participation in learning. We use architectural consultants that specialize in school design to design new schools and to expand or refurbish existing facilities, and to ensure that our facilities can be used efficiently and in a manner that best enhances the professional and educational experience for both staff and students.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

The student recruitment process is defined by the following stages: - _Enquiries: parents considering enrolling their child at a GEMS school register their child’s details online or in person and request further information; - _Visits: parents are encouraged to visit the school campus accompanied by the relevant child and to meet with members of the school’s senior leadership and admissions teams; - _Registration: parents register their child with the school, specify a start date and pay a non- refundable application fee; and - _Enrollments: we aim to place registered students either within the academic year in which they applied or in the subsequent academic year. Students are enrolled on a first-come, first-served basis. We have a centralized enrollment team which works in parallel with dedicated admissions officers at each school. This allows us to leverage demand and enquiry data from across our portfolio of schools, and to refer demand for schools at capacity to schools with excess capacity. We also maintain a waitlist of prospective students who are seeking entry to our schools. 133 ----- The enrollment team uses customer relationship management tools to track, report on, follow-up and help convert enquiries into new enrollments. From the twelve months ended 31 August 2018 onwards, we have implemented Salesforce, a specialized client relationship management system across all of our UAE and Qatar schools, giving us additional marketing functionality and visibility over the enrollment process. _Generation of enquiries_ Many of our enquiries start from parents’ online research. This includes visits to individual school websites, our corporate website, government websites such as those of the KHDA or ADEK and thirdparty reference sites, such as the Good School Guides for Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha and Which School Advisor. Parent referrals are also important for generating enquiries. We offer a “refer a friend” scheme whereby if a referral leads to an enrollment at certain GEMS schools with capacity, then the referring parent will receive a monetary benefit either in the form of a one-off tuition fee discount (if the parent has a child enrolled at a GEMS school) or a cash reward. In addition, we have established relationships with the human resources personnel of major employers and provide information packs, employee handbooks and marketing materials to help new employees understand the local education system. Certain of these employers can reserve places in our schools for their employees. While some employers fund some of our tuition fees as part of expatriate compensation packages, substantially all of our tuition fees are paid by parents directly. We track parental employment details at the time of application, and this data indicates that parents of our students are employed in a wide variety of sectors, with no one sector representing more than 15% of parents, and no single company employing more than 5% of our students’ parents as at 31 May 2017. Relocation agents who settle expatriate families in cities in which our schools are located are also a source of enquiries. We do not pay commission-based placement agencies in the UAE or Qatar to source prospective students. _Marketing and brand awareness_ Our marketing strategy is designed to develop brand awareness among prospective parents and students, along with teachers, regulators and other stakeholders. Our marketing function is centrally controlled with a common brand architecture and agreed communications strategies, materials and support but is executed locally at each school by principals, admissions managers and marketing staff. Our marketing strategy is primarily based on our reputation, referrals and word-of-mouth rather than media campaigns, thereby minimizing our annual marketing spend. We launched a new branding campaign in the first quarter of 2018 which was intended to support the overall GEMS brand. We supplement our marketing strategy with other targeted activities intended to help us raise awareness with parents and prospective teachers. These activities include preparing promotional materials, such as school brochures and educational magazines and holding internal and external public relations exercises and conferences. For example, in association with the Varkey Foundation, a UK registered charity, we have sponsored the Global Education and Skills Forum held annually in Dubai since 2013. We also donate to the annual Global Teacher Prize, a $1,000,000 award, payable over 10 years, which is presented annually to an exceptional teacher who has made an inspirational impact on their students and their community. _Student retention_ We also employ a parent loyalty program, “GEMS Rewards,” to encourage student retention. This loyalty scheme encompasses a number of strategies, including a co-branded credit card which provides a discount on school fees. Parents can also use the GEMS Rewards smartphone-based app to secure discounts and offers on unrelated online and offline purchases. Parents who use co-branded credit cards to pay tuition fees are also able to pay in installments. We pay lower merchant fees on payments made with our co-branded cards than for other credit cards and negotiate generally lower merchant fees with our acquiring bank partners. The majority of our fees are paid via credit or debit cards. 134 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,528
977_1,Offerings 2019.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.54,School** **Eligible Percentage,18.54.5,The lifecycle of a typical GEMS school,"Most new enrollments into our schools are kindergarten or junior grade children, who are joining the education system for the first time as they start school, or who are young children moving to the UAE in the junior grades. As such, we shape our new school development process to generally accommodate junior grades initially, and then to subsequently provide capacity for more senior level grades as the student population matures. We typically develop our new schools in two to three phases. The first phase generally involves the construction of a kindergarten and primary school, providing places for kindergarten through grade five or six students. The first phase is designed to be a complete free-standing school and include all the facilities required, such as designated play areas, learning and discovery areas, reading rooms, sports facilities and swimming pools where relevant. The second phase of construction is typically initiated within three to four years after the first phase opens. The second phase typically involves the construction of secondary school sections for students in the middle and senior grades and typically comprises the development of classrooms as well as any specialist facilities for secondary school students (such as computer labs, libraries, senior sports facilities and fitness suites). Some of our schools have undertaken third phases of construction, which further expand the capacity of the school building. We believe that the benefits of this multi-phase approach include: - minimizing the initial set-up costs of construction by initially only constructing a primary school; - benefiting from the high level of initial demand at the primary school level; and - our schools constructed in the first phase being able to become self-sufficient and financially viable, and the construction of the secondary school in the second phase being generally launched when the first phase is well utilized, thereby providing a source of students for the secondary school. Moreover, our approach is to build primary and secondary schools on the same premises, thereby benefiting from economies of scale and the resulting cost savings while offering a high quality of education to our students. Economies of scale and cost savings are realized by incorporating specialist facilities, such as play areas, drama facilities, art rooms and music facilities, in one location for the benefit of both primary and secondary school students while simultaneously giving students access to a greater variety of facilities and enhancing their educational experience. Furthermore, the development of a secondary school or secondary sections of an existing school is generally undertaken to capture inherent and already visible demand for school places from existing primary school students who are graduating through the junior grades. _Capacity utilization_ New schools generally increase their enrollment year on year until they reach full capacity utilization. As described above, new enrollment is primarily added in early years and kindergarten classes year on year. As at 31 May 2019, our overall utilization of phase one capacity in our 15 Maturing Schools was 96%, our Mature Schools’ capacity utilization was 96% and our total average capacity utilization was 84%. Capacity utilization levels for Maturing Schools typically increase over time, as set out in the table below:",N/A,as_expected,2019,528
977_1,Offerings 2019.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.54,School** **Eligible Percentage,18.54.6,,"Eligible schools that have maintained the same rating of the previous ECI year[(1)] Schools that have improved their rating from[(1)]: ECI x 2 Very Weak to Weak Weak to Acceptable Acceptable to Good Schools that have improved their rating from[(1)]: ECI x 1.75 Good to Very Good Schools that have improved their rating from: ECI x 1.5 Very Good to Outstanding Schools that have dropped in performance (from their current rating to a No increase in school fees lower one)[(1)] Note: (1) For profit schools in Dubai, the last inspection rating conducted by DSIB will be considered while implementing the fee increase as per the above table. The ECI is determined annually by the Dubai Statistics Centre (the “DSC”) and is based on historically observed inflation in the costs of operating a school, as determined by the DSC. The applicable ECI is typically announced in advance of an academic year, allowing school operators to communicate fee increase guidance to parents prior to re-enrollment. The ECI was 2.9% for the 2015–2016 academic year, 3.2% for the 2016–2017 academic year and 2.4% for the 2017–2018 academic year. No ECI was formally communicated for the 2018–2019 academic year and operators were not permitted to raise fees for Dubai schools in that academic year. In April 2019, the DSC announced that the ECI for the 2019-2020 academic year will be 2.07%. Existing schools cannot increase fees without prior approval from the KHDA. The KHDA has also historically considered applications for exceptions to the general framework for fee increases (subject to certain conditions laid out in the framework). Finally, the KHDA and other authorities in Dubai can also decide that tuition fees cannot be increased despite growing inflation, as occurred most recently in the 2018–2019 academic year. See “Regulation Overview—United Arab Emirates—Dubai—Fee _Framework.”_ In Dubai, we have increased fees at all of our schools every year since the 2011-2012 academic year, with exceptions in the 2012-2013 academic year, when the ECI was set at negative 1%, and in the 2018-2019 academic year, when the Dubai Executive Council froze tuition fees. In addition, we may choose not to increase fees at specific schools for commercial reasons. We chose to do so in the 2017-2018 academic year at one school, and will do so again at two schools in the upcoming academic year. Tuition fees for our schools in other jurisdictions are reviewed periodically. In Abu Dhabi, schools are typically able to increase school tuition fees by up to 6% every year, with the permitted fee increase based on performance under four criteria. In Sharjah, Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah, private schools are required to request proposed fee increases directly from the UAE Ministry of Education. Any proposed fee increases are subject to the maximum permitted increase of 10% one year after the last increase, 20% two years after the last increase and 30% three years after the last increase. In Qatar, all fee increases must be approved by the Qatar Ministry of Education. See “Regulation Overview” for details. We view tuition fee increases associated with the ECI as an opportunity to ensure that the operational cost inflation we experience can be passed on to customers, thus supporting our operating margins. _Grade aging effect_ Our historic School ARPS growth also reflects a grade aging effect. Tuition fees are higher in more senior grades across all of our schools. For example, the tuition fee charged for a student entering GEMS Wellington International School in Kindergarten 1 (“KG1”) was approximately $14,800 per 130 ----- student per annum for the 2017–2018 academic year, whereas the tuition fee for a student entering the 12th grade was approximately $25,500 for the same academic year. As at 31 May 2019, 15 of our 48 schools were Maturing Schools, having been opened between September 2013 and August 2017, and three of our schools were classified as New Schools, having been opened after September 2017. Maturing Schools and New Schools primarily attract kindergarten and junior grade students in their first years of opening. As a result, these newer schools have student bodies which are more heavily skewed towards junior grades than our Mature Schools. This results in a lower ARPS at opening as compared to the ARPS when the school is Mature. Each year, as these schools mature, younger students progress through grades in the school, and the average age of the student body rises. This has the natural effect of raising the average School ARPS for the school independently of tuition fee increases. Grade aging also occurs in Mature Schools, where year on year we have observed that the weighted average school grade continues to increase. We attribute this effect to the continuing maturation of the UAE’s expatriate population, and the increasing trend of parents staying longer in the country. Our weighted average grade across our entire school portfolio has increased from grade 4.5 to 4.6 to 4.7 in the twelve months ended 31 August 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. _Mix effect_ Our tuition fees at a portfolio level are also affected by the increasing contribution from newer schools. Tuition fees for our Maturing Schools and New Schools are generally higher than those for our Mature Schools, even within the same price point; the School ARPS in the nine months ended 31 May 2019 for our Mature Schools was $6,013, compared to a School ARPS of $8,684 for Maturing Schools over the same period. As such, incremental students joining schools at a higher price point, and the progression of those students into higher grades at higher prices will generally support higher School ARPS.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

However, we have also acquired schools operated by third parties, including our acquisition of Wesgreen International School in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 and our acquisition of Bellevue, which we are currently in the process of completing. In the period between 1 September 2016 and 31 May 2019, we expanded capacity at our existing schools by 14,695 places, developed seven greenfield schools with a total of 20,506 places and acquired one school with a total of 4,680 places. _Site identification and land bank_ When determining whether to expand in our existing markets, we adopt a multi-stage approach to assess the viability of making an investment. Our dedicated business development team first identifies land parcels suitable for development in areas of high demand. Once a parcel has been identified, an initial feasibility study is prepared. As part of the initial feasibility study, we seek to identify the potential demand for private K-12 English-language education within the specific catchment area of the site. If, based on the outcome of the first phase, we decide to further consider the opportunity, the initial proposition is presented to our investment committee (the “investment committee”) for approval to add the site to our land bank by signing a long-term lease over the site. We typically seek to arrange 136 ----- these leases with multi-year rent-free periods, so that we do not incur ongoing operational expenses during the site’s detailed planning phase. We also seek to negotiate lease clauses that permit termination for convenience, allowing operational flexibility should the site not be deemed suitable for ultimate development. At this point, a detailed feasibility study is prepared to fully evaluate the investment opportunity, with the following factors in particular being considered: (i) the addressable market, which is the anticipated net population growth within a 20-minute commute to the proposed facility; (ii) the anticipated demographics and nationality of the population growth, as this will impact the model, curriculum and pricing for the new school; (iii) the competitive dynamics from existing or planned schools; and (iv) our anticipated share of the net additional K-12 children moving into the area. We do not rely on the attrition of existing schools in place provided by competitors when planning new schools. If the decision is taken to proceed, the development plan and associated capital expenditure are presented for approval to the investment committee, at which stage they must meet certain underwriting thresholds. These thresholds include internal rate of return targets by year seven and certain cash breakeven thresholds. Subject to the approval of the investment committee, construction commences, followed by completion and opening of the school, generally within 12-18 months from commencement of construction, depending on the site, scope of design, and design. _Contractor engagement_ Substantially all of our school construction has historically been undertaken by CMC. CMC is a construction and interior fit-out operator. It is a Varkey Group Affiliate and has over 35 years of experience in the construction industry. It has constructed over 50 schools for us and third-party clients, making it highly experienced and knowledgeable with respect to the particular requirements and construction timetables for our schools. As our preferred school construction supplier, CMC can leverage its long operating history with us to help ensure that school construction projects are delivered on time and within budget. CMC is contracted to develop all of our currently planned or under development schools. _Expansion into new markets_ In considering other potential markets outside of the UAE and Qatar, GMHL considers jurisdictions with strong underlying macroeconomic fundamentals, a large youth population and a limited publicsector school provision. Our shareholder also considers the competitive advantage of being able to offer the benefits of our portfolio of established schools, the opportunities for providing school support services and the availability of high quality staff at the appropriate remuneration levels. Based on the above criteria, GMHL has established a joint venture in the KSA (the “KSA Joint Venture”), in partnership with Hassana. In May 2019, the KSA Joint Venture announced the acquisition of 100% of Ma’arif Holding Company for Education and Training (“Maarif”). Maarif comprises 13 schools and serves over 21,000 students in the KSA. Similarly, GMHL has also established a joint venture in Egypt, in partnership with the private equity firm EFG (the “Egypt Joint Venture”). In November 2018, the Egypt Joint Venture entered into agreements, pursuant to which it acquired four international schools in Cairo. The assets, liabilities and operations of the KSA Joint Venture and the Egypt Joint Venture are outside of the Restricted Group. While both have stand-alone management and staff, we anticipate continuing to provide operational and educational support to both entities, for which we will be remunerated on an arms-length basis. Our shareholder receives management fees from both the KSA Joint Venture and the Egypt Joint Venture. We also receive an intellectual property licensing fee from the KSA Joint Venture. _Development models_ We use one of several development models to construct facilities and expand capacity, depending on what is appropriate in the circumstances: - New site development. A new school may be developed on a new greenfield site, often adjacent to or part of a master planned residential community where an increase in K-12 aged students is 137 ----- anticipated. In this situation, the master plan developer is often the landlord, and the school forms an integral part of the project plan. - On-site extension. Schools may also be developed through the extension of an existing site. This involves the expansion of an existing school, including by constructing phase two or phase three, as discussed in “—The School Operations division—The lifecycle of a typical GEMS school.” - Expansion in parallel. A new school may be developed on a site which is adjacent or closely located to an existing site. Often, this will be the development of a secondary school to capture demand from students already graduating from a primary school. - Relocation and transplant. On occasion, an existing school may be transplanted onto a new or existing site. The decision to use this approach is driven by the maturity of a school, the condition of its infrastructure and the availability of expansion capacity at an existing site. Ideally, it is undertaken near an old school, to maximize the number of students who remain at the new school site. This approach also presents an opportunity to reset fees for a school that may have been open for several years and the fees of which are below the current market rate for a school at that level. Finally, the vacated site can be returned to the landlord (if the lease is coming to an end) or redeveloped into a new facility. The most recent examples of a relocation and transplant were: (i) the merger of the GEMS Dubai American Academy into the facilities of the GEMS Dubai Nations Academy in advance of the twelve months ended 31 August 2018; and (ii) the relocation of our own boys school, Sharjah which was merged with English Private School Sharjah, in the twelve months ended 31 August 2019. We intend to open a new school at a higher price point, GEMS Cambridge Sharjah, on the vacated site, in September 2019. - Acquisition. Under certain circumstances, we will consider the acquisition of single schools or a portfolio of schools. We evaluate potential acquisitions based on a number of factors, including the school’s existing track record, the strength of our management team, the investment rationale, historical financial performance, expected rate of return and integration timeline and growth potential. In addition to GEMS Cambridge Sharjah, we expect to open one school in September 2019 and another in September 2020, with additional schools to open in the following years.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

In addition, we maintain a land bank. As at 31 May 2019, the weighted average lease term of all of our leases for our existing schools was 14 years. _Owned schools_ Under this model, we build and subsequently own all phases of a school building on leased or owned land. The school construction is generally carried at construction cost on the balance sheet. _Leased schools_ Under this model, either the landlord or a third party builds the entire school building, which we then lease. Taken together, owned and leased property management models accounted for 92% of our 48 schools as at 31 May 2019. _Mixed_ On certain sites, a landlord or third party has constructed phase one of a school and we have built the remaining phases. This model accounted for 8% of our schools as at 31 May 2019. _Sale and leaseback schools_ In addition, we have historically raised financing by arranging sale and leaseback transactions for certain of our school buildings. In these instances, we either sold existing schools to real estate 138 ----- investors in return for a commercial lease or approached developers to construct schools to our specifications in return for long-term leases. Properties leased under sale and leaseback arrangements represent our most expensive individual school leases. We have repurchased school buildings operated under the sale and leaseback model, acquiring three schools in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 for $159.8 million and one further school in the UAE in the nine months ended 31 May 2018 for $53.1 million. The repurchase of leases underlying these buildings generated rent savings of $13.5 million and $5.4 million in the twelve months ended 31 August 2017 and 2018, respectively. Concurrently with the transaction, we are acquiring the leasehold interest of two further school buildings in Qatar and aim to complete these transactions by 31 August 2019. _Land bank_ We also maintain a land bank, whereby we seek long-term leases and sign lease options on prospective sites. We also seek rent-free periods and high optionality to return the site. We will then later use our land bank to potentially develop new facilities. Our land bank currently consists of 16 sites, with six sites in Dubai, four sites in Abu Dhabi, two sites in Sharjah and one site in each of Ajman, Al Ain, Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah, although we have identified four of these properties as land we will not develop, and may seek to renegotiate or cancel the related leases.

For example, one of our Premium schools which opened during the twelve months ended 31 August 2014 had 313 students and an average student age of 5.9 years in February 2014, 745 students and an average student age of 6.8 years in February 2015 and 1,380 students and an average student age of 6.2 years in February 2019. We structure our schools to cater to the high levels of demand at the primary school level by offering more classes and focusing on increasing capacity at lower grades. Typically, the required capacity at the later grades in secondary schools decreases due to student turnover and fewer new entrants at the secondary school level. Notwithstanding this, the proportion of our students in senior grades has increased year on year from 17% as at 31 August 2015 to 20% as at 31 May 2019, driven by a maturing overall portfolio. _Financial model_ Typically, our schools reach the operational break-even point (on a school-level EBITDA basis) within three to five years, when capacity utilization reaches approximately 50% or more. Prior to opening a new school, we incur capital expenditure to develop the school’s physical infrastructure, as well as pre-operational expenses such as the costs of securing regulatory approvals, and the cost of hiring school staff to assist in regulatory approvals, marketing, training and school mobilization prior to the opening of the school. Once opened, a new GEMS school typically experiences losses during its first two to three years of operation, due to the lower operational leverage of the fixed components of the school’s operational expenses. These operational expenses include the salaries of the administrative and senior leadership teams, and the relatively fixed components of administrative expenses such as water and electricity charges. Moreover, we typically open a school with the number of teachers we anticipate will be required for the second year of operation, meaning that the school initially opens with more teachers than necessary, and correspondingly smaller class sizes and lower PTRs. As the school adds enrollments, capacity utilization levels and PTRs will correspondingly rise. While the decision to start construction of phase two depends on a number of factors, we typically target the construction of phase two once the school is approaching 50% utilization, with phase two targeted to open in year three or four of the school’s life. Although the foregoing discussion describes the lifecycle of a typical GEMS school, the actual performance of any particular school may vary due to a number of factors, including the location of the school, specific country dynamics and the regulatory environment in which the school operates.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

977_1,Offerings 2019.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.58,UK Schools,18.58.1,Bellevue,"Concurrently with the Offering, we are acquiring a 92.9% shareholding in Bellevue from an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Varkey Group, one of our indirect shareholders. As at 31 May 2019, Bellevue educated 2,717 students across 15 schools, of which 14 are in the United Kingdom, and one is in Switzerland. We intend to operate Bellevue as a stand-alone division within our organization. Bellevue primarily owns and operates independent “prep” day schools. Prep schools teach the NCEW and prepare students aged 3 to 13 to sit the Common Entrance Exam, the 11+ exam, and other entrance examinations which are required for entrance into independent secondary schools in the United Kingdom. Bellevue also operates two secondary schools, Ealing Independent College, a secondary school educating children from 14 to 19 in London, and Surval Montreux, a girls’ secondary boarding school located in Switzerland which teaches the IB curriculum. Bellevue’s UKbased schools are clustered in the South West and North West of the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, in London. In addition, Bellevue’s Bruern Abbey school prepares students with dyslexia or other specific learning difficulties for the Common Entrance and other entrance examinations to mainstream independent senior schools. Bellevue’s schools are Mature and well established in the communities they serve. Bellevue’s oldest school was established in 1834, but all Bellevue’s schools benefit from modern teaching and learning practices as well as modern educational facilities. Bellevue largely attracts prospective students from within local communities through its academic reputation and word-of-mouth recommendations from parents. As a result, Bellevue is less reliant than peers on agents and overseas placement agents to secure new enrollments. In addition, surveys of Bellevue’s parents indicate high and improving levels of customer satisfaction, with over 97% of parents strongly agreeing that their child enjoys coming to school. Unlike our schools in the GCC, Bellevue generally caters to UK resident (i.e. non-expatriate) students. As such, Bellevue’s student churn ratio has been under 10% per year in the last three years, and most students who graduate from Bellevue’s schools progress to another independent secondary or grammar school in the United Kingdom. Compared to our schools in the GCC, Bellevue schools operate at higher levels of capacity utilization. As at 31 May 2019, capacity utilization across the Bellevue portfolio was 83%. Bellevue owns the land and real estate on a freehold basis at nine of its 15 schools. Leases on its remaining schools are long dated, with expiries between 2031 to 2037. _History and Development_ Bellevue was established by its current CEO, Mark Malley through the acquisition of an academically failing school in London in 2003. Mr. Malley, a former headmaster of a UK independent school, subsequently built the portfolio to its current state through a strategy of single site acquisitions, using a blend of (i) strategic, niche and profitable schools, (ii) stable and predictable schools with an established market position, (iii) academically or financially underperforming schools and (iv) greenfield development. In June 2018 GEMS Global, a holding company of the Varkey Group, owned by our Executive Vice Chairman, acquired Bellevue from its former owners. Bellevue believes it has a demonstrated track record of successfully overlaying its education best practices in acquired schools in order to drive educational results, which in turn drives high parent satisfaction and occupancy and low churn at its acquired schools. Bellevue has delivered growth in enrollments ahead of local competitors in most schools, and in most instances in advance of the wider independent UK school segment. Bellevue’s strategy is to continue to drive capacity utilization where space exists in existing schools, selectively extend and develop mature sites to grow capacity, and to continue to acquire single site schools where an opportunity for future revenue growth exists. 141 ----- Bellevue has lodged a planning application to develop a new 420-seat secondary school, 19 Mallord Street, located in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in central London. The application involves the refurbishment of an existing leasehold school site, which is currently vacant. Subject to planning approval, we anticipate opening Mallord Street in the twelve months ended 31 August 2021. In addition to managing its own schools, Bellevue’s management also provide oversight of four independent schools owned by the Varkey Group on an arms-length basis.

Following the transaction, Mr. Malley will have a 7.1% shareholding in Bellevue and through certain incentive arrangements, has rights over 19% of Bellevue’s equity by 2021. _Fees and fee increases_ Fees and fee increases for independent schools are unregulated in the United Kingdom and are set with reference to commercial considerations. The average fees in Bellevue’s preparatory schools 142 ----- range from approximately £7,100 to £14,400 per annum, depending on geographic location and services provided. Average fees in Bellevue’s secondary schools are between £16,200 and £25,000 per annum. We believe that Bellevue’s fees are positioned at the lower end of comparable UK independent school fees and therefore present a compelling value for money proposition relative to the academic outcomes delivered. _Academic performance and regulatory framework_ Bellevue aims to deliver exceptional academic outcomes, largely through (i) the recruitment of high quality school leaders and teachers and (ii) the provision of high quality teaching and learning in generally small format schools featuring small class sizes. UK independent schools are inspected periodically by the Independent Schools Inspectorate, which is overseen by the Office for Standards in Education on behalf of the Department of Education. The Independent School Standards framework was introduced in the UK in 2014. Inspections by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (the “ISI”) may be undertaken to assess “compliance only” with the relevant standards, or a combined inspection of “Educational Quality and Compliance”, which consists of a qualitative review of teaching and learning practices within the school. As the inspection cycle for UK independent schools is undertaken on a rolling basis, not all UK independent schools have yet undergone a full inspection under the standards. Of Bellevue’s 14 UK-based schools, all inspected schools met the standards in their last inspection. Furthermore, five schools have completed full Educational Quality and Compliance inspections by the ISI as at 31 May 2019. Each of these schools secured an “Excellent” rating for both quality of academic and other achievement, and for the quality of pupils’ personal development. In addition to external reviews, Bellevue also undertakes a regular review cycle of peer review and assessment, whereby head teachers review other schools in the portfolio to share best practices across the group. This can cover a wide range of areas, including delivery of education, as well as safeguarding, leadership development and curriculum review.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

The eight objectives applicable to the education sector are: - to be among the 20 highest performing countries in the Programme for International Student Assessment, an international test of knowledge and skills for 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics and science; - to be among the highest 15 performing countries in Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (“TIMSS”), an international test for students in grades 4 and 8; - to ensure that 98% of Emirati students complete their high school education; - to ensure that 95% of children in the UAE attend pre-primary education; - to ensure that 90%. of grade 9 students develop high skills in Arabic language in the UAE National Agenda Parameter assessment; - to ensure that 100%. of schools have high-quality teachers; - to ensure that 100%. of public schools have highly-effective school leadership; and - to ensure that no students need to join the UAE University Foundation Programme, a one-year program which helps students transition from high school to university by building up their communication skills and mathematics proficiency. In connection with the National Agenda, the UAE has published a schools inspection framework (the “Unified Schools Inspection Framework”), which is designed to provide a shared set of quality standards to underpin the UAE’s drive to meet its objectives under the National Agenda. Different Emirates have interpreted the Unified Schools Inspection Framework differently, including with regards to the frequency of inspections; and the thresholds for particular ranking outcomes. However, broadly, all schools in the UAE are inspected periodically, and assessed and reviewed on a similar basis. Dubai has the longest history of inspection under the current framework. To provide a rating for each school, inspectors use the following six-point scale, set out in the Unified Schools Inspection Framework, to express judgements on the overall performance of a school (the “UAE Performance Indicators”): - Outstanding: Quality of performance substantially exceeds the expectation of the UAE; - Very Good: Quality of performance exceeds the expectation of the UAE; - Good: Quality of performance meets the expectation of the UAE—this is the desired level for every school in the UAE; - Acceptable: Quality of performance meets the minimum level of quality required in the UAE—this is the minimum level for every school in the UAE; 148 ----- - Weak: Quality of performance is below the expectation of the UAE; and - Very Weak: Quality of performance is significantly below the expectation of the UAE. The inspection process involves a self-evaluation process completed by the schools, followed by a review of the schools by an independent and experienced inspection team. The inspection teams spend approximately three to five days in each school under review, measuring the school’s performance against its self-evaluation and the Unified Schools Inspection Framework. All schools are expected to have school improvement plans in place, regardless of their initial evaluation results. In March 2018, the UAE Ministry of Education implemented the Teacher Licensing System, which requires all teachers in the UAE to be obtain a UAE teaching license by the end of 2020. To obtain a license, teachers will be required to pass several examinations, depending on their status and existing qualifications, as recognized by the UAE. Following the deadline at the end of 2020, all schools operating in the UAE will be required to ensure that their teachers hold valid teaching licenses.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

The DSIB’s mandate includes: - ensuring that the educational quality of all schools in Dubai has been assessed using an authoritative inspection method; - developing a high-caliber local workforce capable of building and sustaining a world-class inspection organization; - assisting with the improvement of all schools through school inspection; - ensuring that effective remedial action is taken when an inspection identifies schools which have serious weaknesses; 149 ----- - giving parents useful and reliable information about school quality which will assist parents in the school selection choice; and - providing policy-makers and others with an authoritative account of school quality in Dubai. The evaluation of every school in Dubai is based on certain key criteria that are used to judge the overall performance of a school. Such criteria are based on the Unified Schools Inspection Framework and include, but are not limited to, how well the students are progressing in key subjects, how well the students are developing on a personal and social level, the standard of teaching, learning and assessment at the relevant school, how closely the curriculum meets the educational needs of the student, the arrangements in place for the care and support, and health and safety (including protection and safeguarding) of students and the standard of leadership and management of the school.

The price point of a school forms part of our initial application to the KHDA for a new school license, but the opening price point is not regulated. Thereafter, fees are governed by the KHDA School Fees Framework which applies to all private schools in Dubai. The School Fees Framework applies to all tuition fees and to any fees or costs related to services that are provided directly by the schools, and generally governs the mechanism by which school fees can be increased each year. The School Fees Framework has evolved since it was first introduced, and was most recently revised in July 2019 with effect from the 2019-2020 academic year. Once a school is established, the operator is not permitted to increase that school’s tuition fees in the three years following the date of commencement of educational activity. Thereafter, schools cannot increase fees without prior approval from the KHDA. In Dubai, school tuition fees are regulated by the KHDA based on two factors: an annually-adjusted inflation benchmark, the ECI, and a multiplier. Prior to the 2019 revision, the KHDA framework permitted schools to raise fees by a multiplier of ECI linked to the then-prevailing DSIB score of the school. This generally allowed us to raise fees by an amount in excess of inflation. Following the 2019 revision, the multiplier is driven by whether the school has achieved positive or negative changes in its rating from the DSIB. The multiplier is structured to incentivize school operators to invest in their schools in order to raise their ratings. If a school’s rating is upgraded, it can increase fees by the multiplier set out in the following table. If the school’s rating is downgraded, the school will not be able to increase fees by any amount in the coming year. The following table sets out the multiplier applicable to various ratings movements:",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

The applicable ECI is typically announced in advance of an academic year, allowing school operators to communicate fee increase guidance to parents prior to seeking parental re-enrollment intentions. The ECI was 2.9% for the 2015–2016 academic year, 3.2% for the 2016–2017 academic year, 2.4% for the 2017–2018 academic year. No ECI was formally communicated for the 2018-2019 academic year, and in accordance with a directive from Dubai’s Executive Council, school operators were not permitted to raise fees for Dubai Schools in that academic year, at which point the school fee framework was reviewed and revised. In April 2019, the Dubai Statistics Centre announced that the ECI relevant for fee increases for academic year 2019-2020 is 2.07%. Schools with performance ratings “Acceptable” and lower are required to submit (as part of their application), a KHDA approved action plan detailing how the school will invest in the educational process to improve the quality of education in the school. If a school chooses to restructure its tuition fees to a lower fee structure, they cannot then revert back to the previous fees, and all fee increases (according to the fee framework) will be applicable to the restructured fees. Fee increases meant for a particular academic year can only be implemented in that year and cannot be carried forward to upcoming academic years. In the interest of transparency, the KHDA now requires private schools to enter into a parent-school contract for every student prior to the beginning of each academic year, which lists out all fees charged by the school during the academic year. The KHDA has also historically considered applications for exceptions to the general framework for fee increases (subject to certain conditions laid out in the framework).",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

However, within 60 days following the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuers pursuant to the Notes, including any payment obligation resulting from a Change of Control, will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by certain of the Issuers’ existing and future Restricted Subsidiaries that are guarantors under the Senior Facilities Agreement. The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Guarantees to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Notes Collateral—Each Notes _Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability,” “—The insolvency laws of the Cayman Islands and the United Arab Emirates may not be as favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes,” “—Insolvency laws and other limitations on the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect their validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_ Within 60 days following the Issue Date, the Guarantors will consist of (i) Premier School International LLC, (ii) School Transport Services LLC, (iii) GEMS Wellington Academy FZE and (iv) GEMS Menasa IPCO (Cayman) Limited.

A significant portion of the operations of the Cayman Co-Issuer is conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuers and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuers (other than the Guarantors). On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions as of 31 May 2019, the Subsidiaries of the Issuers that will not guarantee the Notes would have had $31.5 million of outstanding debt. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles. Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly 189 ----- less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee.

The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would permit each lender to require a mandatory prepayment of its Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Future Indebtedness of the Cayman Co-Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuers to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuers. Finally, the Issuers’ ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuers’ then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Notes Collateral—We _may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon_ 203 ----- _the occurrence of a change of control as required by the Indenture and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Cayman Co-Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: (1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Cayman Co-Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; (2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Senior Facilities Agreement shall be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and may not be reclassified; 207 ----- (3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of Bank Products, letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; (4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (13), (14) or (15) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; (5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Cayman Co-Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; (7) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” (x) pro forma effect shall be given to Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the Cayman Co-Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (y) in relation to clause (1)(ii) of the second paragraph of this covenant, Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured on the most recent date on which new commitments are obtained (in the case of revolving facilities) or the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case of term facilities) and for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to such date for which such internal consolidated financial statements of the Cayman Co-Issuer are available; and (8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Except as otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid daily (or otherwise periodically), including any revolving indebtedness, shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Cayman Co-Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Dollar Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuers, first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a_ currency other than U.S. dollars, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollardenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed 208 ----- the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Dollar Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the U.S. dollar) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in U.S. dollars will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Cayman Co-Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. None of the Issuers or any Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Guarantee, if any, on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we, the Trustee, the Agents nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities 278 ----- transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. DTC advised the Issuer that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest payment denominated in euros in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each taxable year).

Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisers concerning the applicability of the foreign tax credit and source of income rules to income attributable to the Notes. It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the Notes will not be considered as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Notes will be treated as issued without OID if the difference between their principal amount and their issue price is less than the product of one-fourth of one percent (0.25 percent) of their principal amount multiplied by the number of full years to their maturity.

U.S. Holders that maintain certain types of financial statements and use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally will be required to include certain amounts in income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on their financial statements.

In addition, under the laws of the UAE, the obligation of a guarantor is incidental to the obligations of the principal debtor, and the obligations of a guarantor will only be valid to the extent of the continuing obligations of the principal debtor. Guarantees are regulated under UAE law by the UAE Civil Code (Federal Law No.5 of 1985) on “suretyship” (in respect of guarantees of civil obligations). A guarantee is contingent on the principal debtor failing to perform its primary liability. So, the guarantor will only be liable to the extent of the continuing obligations of the principal debtor and his liability will be affected by any discharge of the principal’s liability or by the fact that the primary obligation is void or unenforceable. UAE law regulates guarantees of commercial obligations and civil obligations. Whether the Civil Code provisions apply to a guarantee depends on whether a UAE Court categorizes the contract as a commercial or a civil transaction. Case law indicates that the UAE courts may consider a guarantee as a civil (as opposed to a commercial) transaction and therefore subject to the provisions of UAE Federal Law No 5 of 1985, as amended (the “Civil Code”). Courts of different Emirates in the UAE have reached different conclusions on this point. There are various provisions of the Civil Code which may provide protection to guarantors, notably Article 1092 of the Civil Code which states that where a debt become due and payable but is unpaid, the beneficiary of the guarantee must claim for debt within six months from the date on which the debt became due, otherwise the guarantor may be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations under the guarantee. It is not clear from the Civil Code whether this provision is mandatory or not. Parties to a guarantee may contract out of the operation of Article 1092 and the courts have confirmed that adherence to this time-bar provision is not required as a matter of public policy. Any provision of an agreement disapplying provisions of the Civil Code applicable to guarantees should be effective, but there remains some residual uncertainty as the courts may take a different approach in future cases. In addition, there are the following exceptions to enforcement of guarantees in the UAE: - UAE courts may not recognize indemnities. The concept of indemnity is undeveloped and unregulated under UAE law. The effectiveness of indemnity provisions may be restricted by UAE law, for example on the basis of unjust enrichment. Indemnities may be enforceable under UAE law to the extent that (a) the obligation to indemnify is clearly expressed in the agreement and (b) the cost or loss can be established in monetary terms (and may not include amounts which are unforeseeable at the time the indemnity was granted, such as losses of profit, the costs of litigation or losses relating to a currency indemnity). Costs and losses may need to be proved. The amount recoverable will be determined in the discretion of the court if the cost or loss cannot be determined from the face of the agreement; - all limitations resulting from the laws of bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, suretyship and similar law of general application affecting creditor’s rights; 288 ----- - UAE courts may give effect to the Shari’ah concept of ‘gharar’ and refuse to give effect to a provision which is deemed too vague or uncertain; - conflicts with public order or morals in the UAE, or mandatory provisions of UAE law (such as compliance with limitations on liability), may be ineffective; - injunctions, orders for specific performance and other equitable remedies are unlikely to be available in the UAE; - where a party to the guarantee is vested with a discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, by law that discretion may be required to be exercised reasonably or that opinion may be required to be based on reasonable grounds; and - claims may also be time barred under the Federal Law No 18 of 1993 (the “Commercial Code”).

Any owners of membership interests in a Dubai limited liability company that are not subject to enforcement would have pre-emption rights to purchase the pledged interests for a 30 calendar day period following notification of the proposed sale of the interests. There are few if any examples of the enforcement of such share security so it is uncertain whether a UAE court would impose conditions on the process for enforcement. Any transfer of a membership interest in an LLC must comply with the rules on foreign ownership of companies in the UAE.",N/A,as_expected,2019,528

Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. A short position is more likely to be created if the Initial Purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.

It may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments for the payment of a specific sum of money rendered by non-UAE courts against the Guarantors incorporated in the UAE, as there is general uncertainty as to the enforceability in the UAE of judgments of foreign courts. Recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments is provided for under UAE Cabinet Resolution No. 57 of 2018 concerning the Executive Regulations of Federal Law No.11 of 1992 (the “Executive Regulations”). Under the Executive Regulations, a judgment or order of a foreign court may be ordered to be enforced in a UAE under the same conditions prescribed in the law of that foreign state for the enforcement of judgments and orders issued in the UAE. However, an enforcement may only be ordered only after the following is verified: a. UAE courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute on which the judgment or order has been issued, and that the foreign courts that issued the judgment or order have jurisdiction according to the rules of international jurisdiction prescribed in its law; b. the judgment or order has been issued by a court in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the judgment or order has been issued and duly certified; c. the parties to the proceedings on which the foreign judgment is issued had been required to appear and were properly represented; d. the judgment or order has acquired the legal effect of res judicata according to the law of the issuing court, provided that a certificate shall be furnished indicating that the judgment has acquired the legal effect of res judicata, or where the same is already stated in the judgment itself; and e. the judgment neither conflicts with a judgment or an order previously issued by a UAE court nor involves anything that violates UAE public order or morality.

The result of this is that the enforcement of foreign awards (i.e. those that are issued from a seat outside of the UAE such as London or Paris and thus subject to the procedural laws of a foreign state) should occur pursuant to the terms of the Convention. Under the terms of the Convention the UAE Courts will be entitled to refuse to enforce a foreign arbitration award only on certain narrowly defined grounds. Broadly speaking, enforcement may be refused where (i) the arbitration agreement was invalid (ii) a party was not given an opportunity to present its case (iii) the tribunal of arbitrators that decided the dispute was incorrectly formed or acted beyond its competence (iv) the award is not final in the state in which it was made (v) under UAE Law the subject matter of the dispute cannot be decided by arbitration and (vi) enforcement of the award would be against the public policy of the UAE. There have been instances where the UAE courts have ordered the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards under the Convention. Additionally, the enforcement regime in the UAE in respect of foreign arbitral awards has been significantly overhauled pursuant to the Executive Regulations. The Executive Regulations provide that a foreign arbitral award may also be enforced in the UAE under the same conditions prescribed in the law of that foreign state for the enforcement of arbitral awards. The arbitration award must have been issued on a matter for which arbitration is permissible in accordance with UAE law and be enforceable in the jurisdiction wherein it has been issued. However, an enforcement may only be ordered only after the following is verified: a. UAE courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute on which the arbitral award has been issued, and that the foreign courts that issued the judgment or order in relation to the award have jurisdiction according to the rules of international jurisdiction prescribed in its law. b. the judgment or order in relation to the award has been issued by a court in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the arbitral award has been issued and duly certified. c. the parties to the proceedings on which the foreign arbitral award is issued had been required to appear and were properly represented. d. the judgment or order has acquired the legal effect of res judicata according to the law of the issuing court, provided that a certificate shall be furnished indicating that the judgment has acquired the legal effect of res judicata, or where the same is already stated in the judgment itself. e. the arbitral award neither conflicts with a judgment or an order previously issued by a UAE court nor involves anything that violates UAE public order or morality.
