Gestamp Funding Luxembourg S.A. (the ‘‘Issuer’’), a direct wholly owned finance subsidiary of Gestamp Automoci´on, S.A. (‘‘Gestamp Automoci´on’’)
has issued A500 million 5.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the ‘‘Euro notes’’) and $350 million 5.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the
‘‘Dollar notes’’ and, together with the Euro notes, the ‘‘notes’’). Interest will be paid on the notes semi-annually on May 31 and November 30 of each
year, commencing November 30, 2013. Each of the Euro notes and the Dollar notes are referred to herein as a ‘‘series of notes’’.

The notes will mature on May 31, 2020. Prior to May 31, 2016, the Issuer may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time by paying a ‘‘make
whole’’ premium. The Issuer may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time on or after May 31, 2016 at the redemption prices set forth in these
listing particulars. In addition, prior to May 31, 2016, the Issuer may redeem at its option up to 35% of aggregate principal amount of each series of
notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in these listing particulars, if at least 65% of the
aggregate principal amount of each series of notes remains outstanding after the redemption. The Issuer may redeem all of the notes, at any time, at a
price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, upon the occurrence of certain changes
in applicable tax law.

The notes are senior obligations of the Issuer secured by a first-ranking charge over the shares of certain subsidiaries of Gestamp Automoci´on (the
‘‘Collateral’’). The notes rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior debt and senior to any of its existing or
future subordinated debt. Gestamp Automoci´on, and certain of its subsidiaries (with Gestamp Automoci´on, the ‘‘Guarantors’’) have guaranteed the
notes (the ‘‘Guarantees’’). Local laws may limit your rights to enforce certain guarantees, and, in addition, your rights with respect to the notes and
the Guarantees are subject to an intercreditor agreement entered into with, among others, lenders under our senior term facilities and revolving credit
facility (the ‘‘Senior Facilities Agreement’’) and creditors under certain of our Existing Debt Facilities (the ‘‘Intercreditor Agreement’’). See
‘‘Annex A—Senior Facilities Agreement’’ for an execution copy of the Senior Facilities Agreement (excluding the schedules thereto) substantially in
the form in which it was executed and ‘‘Annex B—Intercreditor Agreement’’ for an execution copy of the Intercreditor Agreement (excluding the
schedules thereto) substantially in the form in which it was executed.

The Issuer is a direct wholly-owned finance subsidiary of Gestamp Automoci´on, and the Issuer’s only significant assets are funding loans to Gestamp
Automoci´on equal to the aggregate principal amount of the notes issued pursuant to an indenture (the ‘‘Indenture’’) dated as of the issue date of the
notes (the ‘‘Issue Date’’). If Gestamp Automoci´on undergoes a change of control or it sells certain of its assets, the Issuer may be required to offer to
purchase the notes from you.

These listing particulars include information on the terms of the notes, including redemption and repurchase prices, covenants and transfer
restrictions.

There is currently no public market for the notes. We have applied to have the notes admitted to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
for trading on the Euro MTF Market (‘‘Euro MTF’’).

These listing particulars constitute a prospectus for the purposes of the Luxembourg law dated July 10, 2005 (as amended). These listing particulars
may only be used for the purpose for which they have been published.
### Investing in the notes involves a high degree of risk. See ‘‘Risk Factors’’ beginning on page 20.

## Issue price for the Euro notes: 100% Issue price for the Dollar notes: 100%

plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date.

These listing particulars do not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, securities in any jurisdiction where such offer or
solicitation is unlawful. The notes have not been and will not be registered under the US federal or state securities laws or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold within the US or to, or for the account or benefit of, US persons (as defined in Regulation S under
the US Securities Act of 1933 (‘‘Regulation S’’), as amended (the ‘‘Securities Act’’)), except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Initial Purchasers named below are offering the notes only to
‘‘qualified institutional buyers’’ (‘‘QIBs’’), as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act (‘‘Rule 144A’’), in reliance on Rule 144A, and to persons
outside the US in reliance on Regulation S. See ‘‘Notice to Investors’’ and ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ for further details about eligible offerees and resale
restrictions.

The notes were delivered in book-entry form only, through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (‘‘Euroclear’’) and Clearstream Banking _soci´et´e anonyme_
(‘‘Clearstream’’) with respect to the Euro notes and through The Depositary Trust Company (‘‘DTC’’) with respect to the Dollar notes, in each case
on May 10, 2013.

THE NOTES HAVE NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, MAY
NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD IN THE US OR TO US PERSONS. SEE ‘‘PLAN OF
DISTRIBUTION’’ AND ‘‘TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS’’. INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT
THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO BEAR THE FINANCIAL RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT FOR AN
INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT
THE SELLER OF ANY SECURITY MAY BE RELYING ON THE EXEMPTION FROM THE
PROVISIONS OF SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT PROVIDED BY RULE 144A.

No dealer, salesperson or other person has been authorized to give any information or to make any
representation not contained in these listing particulars and, if given or made, any such information or
representation must not be relied upon as having been authorized by the Issuer, any of its affiliates or the
Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates. These listing particulars do not constitute an offer of any
securities other than those to which it relates or an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, to any
person in any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Neither the delivery of
these listing particulars nor any sale made under them shall, under any circumstances, create any
implication that there has been no change in the affairs of the Issuer or of Gestamp Automoci´on since the
date of these listing particulars or that the information contained in these listing particulars is correct as of
any time subsequent to that date.

By receiving these listing particulars, investors acknowledge that they have had an opportunity to request
for review, and have received, all additional information they deem necessary to verify the accuracy and
completeness of the information contained in these listing particulars. Investors also acknowledge that they
have not relied on the Initial Purchasers in connection with their investigation of the accuracy of this
information or their decision whether to invest in the notes.

The contents of these listing particulars are not to be considered legal, business, financial, investment, tax
or other advice. Prospective investors should consult their own counsel, accountants and other advisors as
to legal, business, financial, investment, tax and other aspects of a purchase of the notes. In making an
investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of the Issuer and its affiliates, the terms
of the offering of the notes and the merits and risks involved.

This offering is being made in reliance upon exemptions from registration under the Securities Act for an
offer and sale of securities that does not involve a public offering. The notes are subject to restrictions on
transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under the Securities Act
and applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction pursuant to registration or exemption therefrom. If
you purchase the notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and
warranties as detailed under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’. The notes have not been and will not be registered
with, recommended by or approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‘‘SEC’’) or any
other US federal, state or foreign securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC or any
such commission or regulatory authority reviewed or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of these listing
particulars. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense in the United States.

The Initial Purchasers and Deutsche Trustee Company Limited (the ‘‘Trustee’’) make no representations
or warranties, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in these
listing particulars. Nothing contained in these listing particulars is, or shall be relied upon as, a promise or
representation by the Initial Purchasers of the Trustee as to the past or future.

We have prepared these listing particulars solely for use in connection with the offer of the notes to QIBs
under Rule 144A and to non-US persons (within the meaning of Regulation S) outside the United States
under Regulation S.

The Issuer reserves the right to withdraw the offering of the notes at any time. The Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the notes in whole or in part for any reason or
for no reason and to allot to any prospective purchaser less than the full amount of the notes sought by
such purchaser.

The laws of certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of these listing particulars and the offer and
sale of the notes. Persons into whose possession these listing particulars or any of the notes come must
inform themselves about, and observe, any such restrictions. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the
Trustee or their respective representatives are making any representation to any offeree or any purchaser

of the notes regarding the legality of any investment in the notes by such offeree or purchaser under
applicable investment or similar laws or regulations. For a further description of certain restrictions on the
offering and sale of the notes and the distribution of these listing particulars, see ‘‘Notice to Investors in
the European Economic Area’’, ‘‘Notice to Certain Other European Investors’’ and ‘‘Transfer
Restrictions’’.

To purchase the notes, investors must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any
jurisdiction in which investors purchase, offer or sell the notes or possess or distribute these listing
particulars. Investors must also obtain any consent, approval or permission required by such jurisdiction
for investors to purchase, offer or sell any of the notes under the laws and regulations in force in any
jurisdiction to which investors are subject. None of the Issuer, its affiliates, the Trustee or the Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates will have any responsibility therefor.

No action has been taken by the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer or any other person that would permit an
offering of the notes or the circulation or distribution of these listing particulars or any offering material in
relation to the Issuer or its affiliates or the notes in any country or jurisdiction where action for that
purpose is required.

The notes will only be issued in fully registered form and, with respect to the Euro notes, in denominations
of A100,000 and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof and, with respect to the Dollar notes, in
denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notes sold to QIBs in
reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Rule 144A Global Notes’’). Notes sold to non-US persons outside the US
in reliance on Regulation S will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global Notes’’ and, together with the Rule 144A Global
Notes, the ‘‘Global Notes’’). The Global Notes representing the Euro notes will be deposited, on the Issue
Date, with, or on behalf of, a common depositary for the accounts of the Euroclear and Clearstream and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary. The Global Notes representing the
Dollar notes will be deposited with a custodian for, and registered in the name of, Cede & Co., as nominee

knowledge and belief (having taken reasonable care to ensure that such is the case), the information
contained in these listing particulars is in accordance with the facts in all material respects and does not
omit anything likely to affect the import of such information in any material respect. We accept

NEITHER ANY SUCH FACT NOR THE FACT THAT AN EXEMPTION OR EXCEPTION IS AVAILABLE FOR A SECURITY OR A TRANSACTION MEANS THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS PASSED IN ANY WAY UPON THE MERITS OR QUALIFICATION OF, OR RECOMMENDED OR GIVEN APPROVAL TO, ANY PERSON, SECURITY OR TRANSACTION. IT IS UNLAWFUL TO MAKE OR CAUSE TO BE MADE TO ANY PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER, CUSTOMER OR CLIENT ANY REPRESENTATION INCONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA**

These listing particulars have been prepared on the basis that all offers of the notes will be made pursuant
to an exemption under Article 3 of Directive 2003/71/EC (the ‘‘Prospectus Directive’’, as implemented in
Member States of the European Economic Area (the ‘‘EEA’’) and any amendments thereto, including the
2010 Prospectus Directive Amending Directive, to the extent implemented in the Relevant Member State),
from the requirement to produce and publish a prospectus for offers of the notes. Accordingly, any person
making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the notes should only do so in circumstances in
which no obligations arise for us or any of the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer.
Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do we or they authorize, the making of any offer
of notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which
constitute a final placement of the notes contemplated in these listing particulars.

In relation to each Member State of the EEA that has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a
‘‘Relevant Member State’’), with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is
implemented in that Relevant Member State (the ‘‘Relevant Implementation Date’’), an offer is not being
made and will not be made to the public of any notes which are the subject of the Offering contemplated
by these listing particulars in that Relevant Member State, other than:

(i) to any legal entity which is a ‘‘qualified investor’’ as defined in the Prospectus Directive;

(ii) to fewer than 100 or, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the relevant provision of the
2010 Prospectus Directive Amending Directive, 150, natural or legal persons (other than
‘‘qualified investors’’ as defined in the Prospectus Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus
Directive, subject to obtaining the prior consent of the Initial Purchasers nominated by the Issuer
for any such offer; or

(iii) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(s) of the Prospectus Directive, provided that
no such offer of the notes shall require us or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus
pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression ‘‘offer of the notes to the public’’ in relation to the notes
in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and the notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to
purchase or subscribe the notes, as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any measure
implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State, and includes any relevant
implemented measure in each Relevant Member State, and the expression 2010 Prospectus Directive
Amending Directive means Directive 2010/73/EU.

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN OTHER EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

**Financial information and operational data**

These listing particulars include our audited consolidated historical financial statements as of and for the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. In addition, we have also presented certain summary
historical financial information for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, which have been derived
from our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008. Other financial data is included which is derived from our accounting records. We prepare our

vii


-----

financial statements in euro. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial information in these listing
particulars has been prepared in accordance with IFRS applicable at the relevant date. IFRS differs in
certain significant respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the US.

See ‘‘Independent Auditors’’ for a description of the independent auditors’ report dated April 8, 2013 on
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010,
which have been audited by Ernst & Young, S.L., independent auditors, as stated in their unqualified
reports appearing herein on pages F-1 to F-132 of these listing particulars.

We have presented certain information in these listing particulars that are non-IFRS measures. As used in
these listing particulars, this information includes ‘‘EBITDA’’, which represents operating profit before
amortization, impairment and depreciation. These listing particulars also contain other measures and
ratios such as: EBITDA margin; capital expenditures, net proceeds using in (from) acquisitions and
dispositions, cash, cash equivalent; and current financial assets; total financial debt; net financial debt; net
financial expenses; and leverage and coverage ratios. We present these non-IFRS measures because we
believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other
interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity.

In particular, we believe that EBITDA is meaningful for investors because it provides an analysis of our
operating results, profitability and ability to service debt and because EBITDA is used by our chief
operating decision makers to track our business evolution, establish operational and strategic targets and
make important business decisions. To facilitate the analysis of our operations, this indicator excludes
amortization, impairment and depreciation expenses from operating profit in order to eliminate the impact
of general long-term capital investment. Although we are presenting this measure to enhance the
understanding of our historical operating performance, EBITDA should not be considered an alternative
to operating profit as an indictor of our operating performance, or an alternative to cash flows from
operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. EBITDA as used in these listing particulars may not be
calculated in the same manner as ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’, which is calculated pursuant to the Indenture
governing the notes as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes’’, or for the purposes of any of our other
indebtedness.

The information presented by EBITDA, other adjusted financial information and other pro forma
financial data presented in these listing particulars is unaudited and has not been prepared in accordance
with IFRS or any other accounting standards. We present these non-IFRS measures because we believe
that they and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties
as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. In addition, the presentation of these measures is
not intended to and does not comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC; compliance with its
requirements would require us to make changes to the presentation of this information.

You should not consider EBITDA or any other non-IFRS or financial measures presented herein, as
alternatives to measures of financial performance determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, such as net income, as a measure of operating results or cash flow as a measure of
liquidity. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS. Our computation of EBITDA
and other non-IFRS financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies.

Rounding adjustments have been made in calculating some of the financial information included in these
listing particulars. Figures shown as totals in some tables and elsewhere may not be exact arithmetic
aggregations of the figures that precede them.

**Industry data**

In these listing particulars, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the market in
which we operate and compete. We have obtained this information from various third party sources,
including providers of industry data, discussions with our customers and our own internal estimates. While
we believe that industry publications, surveys and forecasts are reliable and we accept responsibility for the
correct extraction or reproduction of the data, they have not been independently verified, and neither we
nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such
information set forth in these listing particulars.

Additionally, industry publications, surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained
therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of
such information is not guaranteed and in some instances state that they do not assume liability for such

information. We cannot assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such information as we have not
independently verified such information.

In certain cases we have not been able to refer to market information more recent than 2011, as any such
more recent market information was not available to us. In calculating the relative position of the original
equipment manufacturers by production volume, the production of non-Chinese brands in China has been
attributed entirely to the original equipment manufacturers who own such brands and has not been
separately attributed to the joint ventures manufacturing such vehicles or to other members of such joint
ventures.

In addition, in many cases, we have made statements in these listing particulars regarding our industry and
our position in the industry based solely on our experience, our internal studies and estimates, and our own
investigation of market conditions.

We cannot assure you that any of these assumptions are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the
industry, and none of our internal surveys or information has been verified by any independent sources.
Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or
completeness of this information. Some of the surveys or sources were compiled by our advisors and are
not publicly available and accordingly may not be considered to be as independent as other third party
sources.

**EXCHANGE RATE AND CURRENCY INFORMATION**

The following tables set forth, for the periods set forth below, the high, low, average and period end
Bloomberg Composite Rate expressed as U.S. dollars per A1.00. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a ‘‘best
market’’ calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all
contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The
Bloomberg Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask
rate. The rates may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements and other financial information appearing in these listing particulars. We make no
representation that the U.S. dollar amounts referred to below could have been or could, in the future, be
converted into euro at any particular rate, if at all.

The average rate for a year means the average of the Bloomberg Composite Rates on the last day of each
month during a year. The average rate for a month or for any shorter period, means the average of the
daily Bloomberg Composite Rates during that month, or shorter period, as the case may be.

The Bloomberg Composite Rate of the Euro on April 30, 2013 was $1.3168 per A1.00.

**SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights selected information contained in these listing particulars. In these listing particulars,_
_we generally use ‘‘we’’, ‘‘our’’ and other similar terms to refer to Gestamp Automoci´on, S.A. and its_
_consolidated subsidiaries. This summary should be read as an introduction to these listing particulars. It does_
_not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the_
_remainder of these listing particulars. Any decision by an investor to invest in the notes should be based on a_
_thorough consideration of these listing particulars in its entirety, including ‘‘Risk Factors’’, ‘‘Operating and_
_Financial Review and Prospects’’ and our financial statements and related notes and information contained_
_elsewhere in these listing particulars as well as the information referred to under ‘‘Where You Can Find More_
_Information’’._

**Our Company**

We are a leading global automotive supplier active in the design, development and manufacture of metal
components and assemblies for sale to original equipment manufacturers (‘‘OEMs’’), primarily for use in
the production of light vehicles. We have an extensive global footprint of 94 production facilities in 19
countries over four continents with four additional plants under construction as of December 31, 2012. We
supply our products globally to all of the 12 largest OEMs by production volume. Our extensive
geographical and customer diversification allows us to take advantage of global growth opportunities and
has mitigated the impact of regional production fluctuations on our business during economic downturns.

We offer our OEM customers a diverse product portfolio, supplying body-in-white (‘‘Body-in-White’’) and
chassis (‘‘Chassis’’) structures and complex assemblies, opening systems and mechanisms (‘‘Mechanisms’’),
as well as tooling and dies and other related services.

  - _Body-in-White: Our Body-in-White product portfolio includes large component parts and_
assemblies, such as hoods, roofs, doors, fenders and other high quality ‘‘Class A’’ surfaces and
assemblies, which are used to create the exterior skin of an automobile. This product portfolio
also includes structural and other crash-relevant products, such as floors, pillars, rails and wheel
arches, which together with the exterior skin component parts and assemblies form the essential
upper and under body (platform) structures of an automobile.

  - _Chassis: Our Chassis product portfolio consists of systems, frames and related parts, such as front_
and rear axles and links, control arms and integrated links, which link the body and the
powertrain of an automobile and carry the load of the vehicle.

  - _Mechanisms: Our Mechanisms product portfolio consists of mechanical components such as_
hinges for doors, hoods, and trunk lids, door checks and door hinges with integrated door checks
that join the automobile’s body with the moving parts and that enable the user to open and shut
the automobile’s front, side and rear doors and lift-gates. Mechanisms also include powered
systems that allow automobile doors to open and close electrically and by remote activation.

  - _Other products (tooling): We have extensive in-house capabilities in the design, engineering,_
manufacturing and servicing of dies and tools in support of our customers and in-house press
manufacturing.

We believe that we are the number 1 supplier of Body-in-White and Chassis products globally by combined
revenue in 2011 as compared to the combined revenue of our two closest competitors for their
Body-in-White and Chassis products in 2011. In Mechanisms products, we believe that we are the clear
market leader among individual suppliers in Western and Eastern Europe combined, and in South
America, with estimated regional market shares of approximately 50% and 40%, respectively, by revenue
in 2011.

We are one of the very few truly global suppliers to OEMs in our product portfolio, which sets us apart
from many of our competitors in the industry. We have long-standing and entrenched relationships with
our largest OEM customers and, as a result, have been able to proactively manage our business to meet the
developing global trends in the industry and the resulting changes in the requirements of the OEMs that
we supply.

In 2012, our revenue was A5,757.3 million and our EBITDA was A620.1 million. During the same period,
we derived revenues of A4,748.3 million from our Body-in-White and Chassis sales, representing
approximately 82.5% of our total revenue and revenues of A682.3 million from our Mechanisms sales,
representing approximately 11.9% of our total revenue.

1


-----

We believe that our historical and continuing financial and operational success and stability have been, and
continue to be, driven by our strategic, customer-focused geographical expansion and diversified revenue
streams, as well as our manufacturing, process, design and technological expertise. We believe that these
factors have allowed us to achieve our position as a leading global supplier in the automotive industry, and
one of strategic importance to many of the largest OEMs globally.

**Our Market**

The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, sells and services motor vehicles which
are classified into light vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles. The automotive production value chain is
split between OEMs such as Volkswagen AG (‘‘Volkswagen’’), the Renault-Nissan Alliance (‘‘RenaultNissan’’), Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (‘‘BMW’’), General Motors Company (‘‘General Motors’’) and
Daimler AG (‘‘Daimler’’), and automotive suppliers like us. Automotive suppliers are then further
categorized into three different tiers. Tier 1 suppliers such as us sell their products directly to
OEMs. Typically these products are large modules or systems which integrate components, sometimes
sourced from Tier 2 automotive suppliers. Tier 2 suppliers in turn typically integrate products from a
further layer of suppliers referred to as Tier 3 suppliers.

As the automotive industry has evolved, global trends have developed across the industry that have been
driven by a combination of financial, legal and regulatory requirements and the increasing importance of
growth economies relative to more traditional mature economies. In the context of recent and expected
trends, we consider North America currently to be among our growth markets, in addition to markets in
developing countries.

_Weight and emissions reduction; Safety:_ The OEMs that we supply, and automobile manufacturers
generally, are increasingly focused on weight and emissions reduction in order to meet evolving legal,
regulatory and industry-standard requirements in the markets in which they operate, as well as on the
safety of passengers, other road users and pedestrians. The evolution of the regulatory environment is
complex and has required automotive suppliers such as ourselves to focus on the design and development
of technologies to address the various regulations and to differentiate us from our competitors.

_Growth economies:_ While vehicle production demands have fluctuated across the global economy in
recent years, particularly at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, on a normalized level
the demand in growth economies has generally continued to increase. Industry sources forecast that in the
years to 2020 there will be a higher compound annual growth rate (‘‘CAGR’’) of sales in Brazil, Russia,
Indian and China and in other growth economies than that experienced in more mature economies, such
as those of Western Europe. In response to this, OEMs continue to develop their presence in these
markets, resulting in an increased need for OEMs to establish supplier networks beyond their home
markets. In certain of these markets, such as China, there is already significant demand for new, premium
brand vehicle models. Nevertheless, vehicle demand in these growth economies is predominantly for less
advanced models with lower entry-level price points. The evolution of volume demand in these markets is
in tandem with an evolution of regulatory and industry standards modeled after those set earlier by more
mature economies. This trend not only offers automobile suppliers such as ourselves an opportunity to
expand our business with our customers in these growth markets, but it also is an indicator of the high
predominance of steel rather than other more expensive materials in Body-in-White, Chassis and
Mechanisms components in the industry for the foreseeable future.

_Common platforms:_ OEMs are increasingly designing vehicle models built on common but variable
platforms which can be produced in high volumes. For example, Volkswagen MQB A/B platform is made
for 29 different automobile models including Golf, Passat, Jetta, Audi A3 and Seat Leon, is made in
15 different countries and is expected to reach peak annual production of 5.4 million in 2020. The RenaultNissan CMF1 platform is made for 20 different automobile models including Megane, Laguna, X-Trail and
Qashqai, is made in 17 different countries and is expected to reach peak annual production of 1.7 million
in 2020. The use of common platforms allows OEMs to increase economies of scale across the value chain,
differentiate their products from those of their competitors, to expand the number of product segments in
which they compete, extend the life of existing automobile platforms and remain responsive to changing
lifestyle trends and customer tastes. This trend towards common platforms provides automotive suppliers
such as us increased opportunities to supply larger volumes of products and also to benefit from economies
of scale.

2


-----

_Consolidation of suppliers:_ In order to take advantage of the operational economies of scale across the
value chain, OEMs are encouraging consolidation of their supplier-base with an increased focus on large,
technically and financially strong global suppliers capable of producing consistent and high-quality
products across geographies. The OEMs we supply use a number of factors to determine their suppliers
including, among other things, quality, service (including location, service interruptions and on-time
delivery), in-house research and development (‘‘R&D’’) and technological capabilities, overall track record
and quality of relationship with the OEM, production capacity, financial stability and price. In recent years,
we have noticed that development expertise, an extensive geographical footprint, consistent and high
quality production capability and diverse ancillary competencies tend to offset price-sensitivities among
OEMs who appreciate the added-value inherent in these other factors.

_Outsourcing:_ As OEMs increasingly focus their resources on automobile assembly, they are either
maintaining or increasing the levels of production outsourcing to suppliers such as ourselves. As they grow
outside of their home markets, they are more inclined to turn to external suppliers for content they might
have done in-house. Suppliers such as ourselves can benefit from economies of scale derived from serving
various customers, that our OEM customers find more difficult to achieve in our product segment when
manufacturing abroad. In addition, specialization has led to advances achieved by suppliers such as
ourselves in certain technologies, such as hot stamping, where we are a market leader, which OEMs find
difficult to match in-house in price and quality, thereby increasing outsourcing in these areas, even in
mature economies.

**Our strengths**

**_Highly diversified revenue base across regions, customers and products_**

_Regional diversification_

We have a geographically highly diversified global footprint with 94 production facilities in 19 countries
over four continents with four additional plants under construction as of December 31, 2012. Since 2007,
we have focused our expansion outside our traditional markets in Western Europe, into North America,
South America, Asia and Eastern Europe where we have been able to capture the increasing demand for
our products, in part driven by a significant increase in vehicle production, particularly in the US, Mexico,
Brazil, China, India, Thailand, Turkey and Russia.

We are one of very few truly global players in our product portfolio who have committed substantial
investment to and have a well established presence in these growth markets. We are market leaders by
revenue in the majority of them, which gives us a competitive advantage over those suppliers who are yet to
establish themselves in these growing markets. For example, since 2007, when we had no production in
Asia, we have increased our revenues derived from our Asian operations to A460.6 million in 2012.

As part of our customer-focused approach to our expansion strategy, we have proactively managed the
decision of when and where to expand in our growth markets by coordinating our roll-out plans with those
of the OEMs we supply. In the past five years, we have opened 18 production facilities in our growth
markets, with four more under construction as of December 31, 2012. Our strong geographical
diversification throughout our regional centers of operation allows us to take advantage of global growth
opportunities and has mitigated the impact of regional demand fluctuations on our business during
economic downturns. The charts below reflect the evolution of our regional diversification between 2007
and 2012 by revenue:

_Customer diversification_

We have a well diversified customer base which, through a successful development strategy, has expanded
to include all of the 12 largest OEMs by production volume in 2012, as compared to seven of the largest
OEMs by production volume in 2007. In the financial year ended December 31, 2012, our top three OEM
customers accounted for 51.3% of our sales to OEMs (excluding tooling), compared to 60.3% in the
financial year ended December 31, 2007.

We have pursued a strategy of customer diversification and have forged new global relationships with
Jaguar Land Rover, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda and other OEMs with whom we had a limited relationship
prior to 2007. The charts below reflect the evolution of our customer base between 2007 and 2012:

_Product diversification_

Our historic product portfolio has been comprised primarily of Body-in-White products and, to a lesser
extent, Chassis products. With the acquisition of the metal forming business unit of the ThyssenKrupp
group (‘‘ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming’’) in 2011, we have significantly strengthened our position in
Chassis products. Sales of our Body-in-White and Chassis products represented 82.5% of our total
revenues in 2012.

The acquisition in 2010 of the body components business unit of Edscha AG (‘‘Edscha’’), a manufacturer
of Mechanisms products, enabled us to diversify our product portfolio by further increasing the range of
products we can offer our customers in the area of body and structural automotive components. Sales of
our Mechanisms products represented 11.9% of our total revenues in 2012. Our expansion into these
product areas was in line with our long-term growth strategy and strongly supported by our key OEM
customers.

The diversification of our product portfolio has helped us to strengthen our strategic relationships with
OEMs, who are able to turn to us for innovative and market-leading product solutions across the
value chain.

**_Technology and leading R&D capabilities_**

One of the global trends in the automotive industry is the increased focus on innovative and
technologically advanced products that seek to address the parallel concerns of improved safety for
passengers and road users and weight and emissions reduction. Our commitment to developing innovative,
high quality products has defined our approach to our customers. We are a global leader in the automotive
supplier industry in the use of high strength and ultra high strength steel, which find their application in
many body parts of the car where it helps to reduce vehicle weight and improve fuel and emissions
efficiency while also improving safety in a cost-effective way. Many of our products are manufactured using
our state-of-the-art technologies in innovative press hardening (also known as hot stamping) and other
high strength stamping processes. These products provide superior safety and weight reduction,
differentiate us from our competition and help us to achieve leading positions in the industry. We have
made significant investments over the past three years in rolling out our press hardening and stamping
technology in our facilities around the world to respond to growing demand from OEMs for our products.

Our innovative products and market-leading processes are developed through our targeted R&D platform,
which has a dedicated team of approximately 1,000 employees, across 12 facilities spread around the globe.
Furthermore, we are among the very few Tier 1 suppliers that have in-house tooling capabilities.
Underlying our innovative products and processes and in-house capabilities is the maintenance of rigorous
quality management systems in all of our manufacturing plants and R&D facilities. Through regular
internal audits we are able to ensure that our products and processes are monitored to the highest industry
standards. We believe that these competencies and capabilities along the entire value chain give us a
competitive advantage over many of the other suppliers.

**_Leading market positions_**

We believe that we are the number 1 supplier of Body-in-White and Chassis products globally by combined
revenue in 2011 as compared to the combined revenue of our two closest competitors for their
Body-in-White and Chassis products in 2011. In Body-in-White products, we believe that we are the clear
market leader among individual suppliers in Western and Eastern Europe combined, and in
South America, with estimated regional market shares of approximately 31% and 22% respectively by
revenue in 2011. In Chassis products, we believe that we are number two in the market among individual
suppliers in Western and Eastern Europe combined, and in South America, with estimated regional
market shares of approximately 24% and 25% respectively by revenue in 2011. Body-in-White, Chassis and
Mechanisms products collectively represented A5,430.7 million or 94.3% of our revenues in 2012.

In developing and rolling out new models, OEMs are increasingly collaborating with suppliers to design
models around common platforms and are seeking to consolidate their supplier-base with an increased
focus on large, technically and financially strong global suppliers that are capable of producing consistent
and high-quality products at competitive prices. As a result, large, multi-technology, high-quality Tier 1
suppliers such as ourselves are increasingly taking market share from smaller competitors, as we are in a
better position to meet these OEM criteria.

We have strategic and long-standing relationships with our largest OEM customers, which are based on
confidence and an understanding established over many years of successful collaboration. There are very
few suppliers that, like us, have such long-standing relationships with the largest global OEMs, and there
are an even smaller number of suppliers that, like us, are capable of delivering solutions to complex
projects, truly globally and on a consistent and high quality basis across the product portfolios. Our scale
and ability to develop differentiated solutions for OEMs on a global footing are critical to our success and
differentiate us from local and regional suppliers of car components.

Our highly advanced technological capabilities, global manufacturing and managerial footprint, significant
operational scale and track record of financial stability enable us to be one of the very few suppliers who
can support an OEM throughout the full product life cycle, including as a development partner during the
early stages of product development. This ability to support the development process of OEMs and act as
an outsourcing partner to them globally is an important differentiator, especially on innovative product
solutions, and would take significant investment and many years to attempt to replicate.

From operational, technical and logistical perspectives, OEMs face substantial switching costs in replacing
the supplier of a particular component or platform, particularly during the life cycle of a specific vehicle
model, and the supplier of a particular car model is often also chosen for subsequent generations of that
model. This is largely due to the long lead-time and significant investment required to set up the
production and supply processes, and to the efficiencies and savings gained through experience with the
manufacturing processes of particular products.

Our long-standing and collaborative relationships with OEMs, highly advanced technological capabilities,
global manufacturing and managerial footprint, significant operational scale and track record of financial
stability help us to develop a competitive advantage over our competitors, entrench our strategic
relationships with OEMs and reduce the risk of a committed OEM switching from us to an alternative
supplier.

**_High mid-term revenue visibility, predictable cost-base and conservative financial risk profile_**

We have long-term and strategic relationships with our OEM customers. In our industry, once a project
has been nominated to a preferred supplier, it is rare for an OEM to switch to another supplier, given the
prohibitive operational, technical and logistical costs of switching, particularly during the life cycle of a
specific vehicle model. Given these factors, while the actual revenues which we derive from a project

5


-----

ultimately depend on our OEM customers’ production volumes achieved for the respective car models, we
have good visibility of mid-term revenues within a relatively small range of sensitivity. Each year, most of
our revenues are derived from projects that continue into following years, given that vehicle cycles last
several years.

In addition, our OEM customer, brand and model diversification, highly diversified global footprint and
our complementary product lines strongly mitigate the effects of regional demand or individual model
volume fluctuations and help to reduce mid-term revenue volatility.

We have a relatively predictable cost base, with limited maintenance capital expenditure once a project is
ongoing and limited exposure to raw material price volatility. The primary raw material used in our
business is steel, which in recent years has represented approximately 50% of our sales. While steel prices
affect our revenue and costs, historically, our profit margins have not been significantly affected by changes
in steel prices. In 2012, over 60% of our steel was purchased through OEM re-sale programs, under which
an OEM customer negotiates directly with the steel suppliers the price of the steel that we use to
manufacture components for that OEM. Such negotiated steel price is passed through to the OEM
customer in the sale price of the automotive component. The remainder of our steel purchasing
requirements in 2012 were met through contracts with steel suppliers that we negotiated. Historically, we
have negotiated with our OEM customers to pass through the increase or decrease in the steel price,
eliminating significant volatility in our margins relating to volatility in steel prices. Due to our strong
relationships with OEMs and the large steel volumes we acquire in the market place, we expect to be able
to negotiate competitive steel contracts with suppliers and to pass through cost increases to our customers,
thus stabilizing the effect on our results.

In addition to our limited exposure to raw material price volatility, we have a low operating leverage, with
fixed costs accounting for less than 25% of our revenues in 2012. A significant part of our labor costs,
which have represented in recent years between approximately 15% and 17% of our total annual sales, are
semi-variable in nature and can be adjusted to meet business needs. For example, in 2008 and 2009, we
were able to respond quickly to the deterioration in market conditions and took measures to contain costs
by lowering headcount, including a reduction in the number of temporary personnel.

We have been able to keep our leverage ratios stable despite our sizeable acquisitions in 2010 (Edscha) and
in 2011 (ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming). We were able to continue to invest during the downturn and
maintain a high level of profitability by managing our working capital effectively, managing the timing of
capital expenditures and delivering cost savings across our business. Our predictable cost-base,
conservative financial profile and low operating leverage reduce the exposure of our operations to
unpredictable externalities and are valued by our OEM customers.

**_Experienced management team focused on operational excellence, profitable growth and stable shareholder_**
**_structure_**

Our management team has extensive experience in the industry and most of our executive committee have
been with the company for more than 10 years. Operational excellence is deeply rooted in our
organizational structure and culture. Our geographical divisions are focused on improving manufacturing
processes (built upon plant-by-plant profit centers), while our business units are centered on customers,
products, process innovation and R&D. Our focus on operational excellence across all of our production
and R&D facilities has established us as one of the technology, quality and innovation leaders in the
industry.

Our management team has a demonstrated track record of achieving long-term profitable growth through
the economic cycle, maintaining double-digit EBITDA margins even during the 2008-2009 economic crisis.
Our recent successful major acquisitions in 2010 (Edscha) and in 2011 (ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming)
were driven by our management’s identification of the substantial value creation potential of these
businesses.

Our controlling shareholders are long-term holders, supportive of our vision and strategy. Our Chief
Executive Officer, who is also one of our largest shareholders, has been instrumental in driving our
profitable growth strategy.

**Our strategies**

Our mission is to strive to be an indispensible strategic partner for a diversified OEM customer base across
our entire product portfolio. The strategies to achieve our mission, set out in more detail below, are

6


-----

founded upon the pillars of best-in-class processes and product technology innovation, customer-focused
growth and diversification of our global footprint, while maintaining operational excellence at all levels and
in all regions.

**_Retain and strengthen technological and quality leadership_**

Our objective is to leverage our operational economies of scale to provide our customers with a
best-in-class range of products that seek to address weight and emissions reduction targets, as well as
improved passenger and road user safety. We intend to continue to strengthen our technological
competencies to benefit from the trend towards co-development of new vehicles and common platforms
between OEMs and suppliers, while also growing our presence in innovative technologies. Our R&D
platform plays a key role in the development of new products, applications, technologies and processes,
and we intend to continue to invest to retain our technological leadership and respond to the latest
automotive industry trends.

**_Increase penetration with OEMs_**

Having significantly improved our worldwide customer penetration since the global financial crisis, we
believe that we are poised to benefit from the large number of new model roll-outs of our OEM customers.
We aim to increase our market share by winning new business across our global footprint. One of our key
focus areas for future growth is in deepening supply relationships with Japanese OEMs outside of Japan
(our sales to Japanese OEMs represented approximately 5% of our revenues in 2012 whereas their share
of global production of light vehicles in 2012 was approximately 22.4%). We see a trend of Japanese
OEMs shifting more of their production base outside of Japan to be closer to the markets with growing
demand for vehicles. In doing so, Japanese OEMs are more open to work with foreign suppliers. We
believe that our relationship with Mitsui & Co. Ltd. (‘‘Mitsui’’) through our joint venture in North and
South America will enhance our relationships with Japanese OEMs in general. We also intend to grow with
other Asian OEMs outside of their home markets.

**_Expand with discipline through selective and profitable investments_**

We aim to be an indispensable global partner for our OEM customers and we strive to achieve this aim by
continually proving our reliability as a strategic supplier by, for example, providing solutions to their most
critical needs on a global scale, and by continuing to tailor our expansion plans to match theirs.

Our capital expenditure is associated with disciplined growth, generally tied specifically to client project
nominations. Over the past five years we have opened 16 new manufacturing facilities in China, India,
Brazil, Russia, Turkey, Czech Republic, Korea and Argentina and we have also invested in two new
manufacturing facilities in the US, which have collectively added to our EBITDA and cash flow from
operating activities. While returns on investments are not guaranteed, in assessing a new investment, as
part of our internal decision making methodology, one of the factors our management considers is whether
we believe that the investment may result in an internal rate of return to us of at least 15%.

This selective and disciplined approach to investments has significantly contributed to our increase in
EBITDA from A390.0 million in 2010 to A620.1 million in 2012 and to our increase in cash flows from
operating activities from A271.2 million in 2010 to A371.5 million in 2012. Although, we have favored
organic growth over acquisitions, through our strategic acquisitions of Edscha (2010) and ThyssenKrupp
Metal Forming (2011), we have participated in the consolidation and rationalization of the supplier base in
collaboration with OEMs.

Currently the primary focus, both for our OEM customers and for us, is on growth markets where there
are opportunities to capitalize on growing long-term demand relative to that of the mature economies. For
instance, we believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of China’s growth as a result of our
existing footprint of high-quality manufacturing facilities in the country. Three out of our four additional
plants that are currently under construction are located in China to meet non-Chinese OEMs’ local needs.
There currently is substantial demand for our products in growth markets that would require additional
manufacturing facilities and we aim to take advantage of this demand through selective and disciplined
investments.

**_Maintain and bring improved operational excellence to bear on existing and acquired businesses_**

Our objective is to deliver a best-in-class range of products to our OEM customers and, to this end, we
strive to maintain an organizational structure and culture with consistent levels of operational excellence
across all of our production and R&D facilities.

At the same time, we focus on reducing our cost base through improved economies of scale and
capitalizing on synergies with recently acquired businesses. Over the past five years, we have delivered
double-digit EBITDA margins in our existing businesses and have a track record of improving EBITDA
margins in acquired businesses as we adapt them to our best-in-class manufacturing techniques and
processes.

**_Evaluate regional partnerships in new markets_**

We continually evaluate working with regional strategic partners when entering new markets in order to
limit start-up risks and benefit from partners’ intimate knowledge of local requirements and customers’
needs. Two examples of such joint ventures are our operations in Turkey, with Bey¸celik, and in Russia, with
Severstal. We also have financial partners in some joint ventures with the aim to mitigate the financial costs
of entering new markets. We have recently announced a joint venture with Mitsui which we expect will
bring both financial and strategic benefits. If opportunities arise in the future, we will evaluate suitable
partnerships strategically aligned from a customer, technological, geographic and/or financial perspective.

**Recent developments**

_Current Trading_

We are in the process of finalizing our results for the first quarter of 2013. Based on our management
accounts and information currently available, we estimate that for the twelve months ended March 31,
2013 our revenue will be approximately A5.6 billion and our EBITDA will be between A598 million and
A602 million. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2012 our revenue was A5.3 billion and our EBITDA
was A577.6 million.

Our results for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013 compared to the twelve months ended March 31,
2012 benefited from the full-year effect of the consolidation of ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming from
August 1, 2011, as well as from an increase in revenue in the US, Russia and Brazil, partially offset by lower
revenue in Western Europe, particularly during the first quarter of 2013.

Our EBITDA for the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 was negatively impacted by
a decline in revenue in Western Europe, as well as by the costs associated with projects under construction
and the negative or low contribution of projects in ramp-up phase. Projects under construction in the first
quarter of 2013 included Kaluga II in Russia, the expansion of Puebla in Mexico, as well as Dongguan and
Shenyang in China; and projects still in ramp-up phase included projects such as Louny in the Czech
Republic, Chennai III in India, Gravata´ı and Santa Isabel in Brazil, West Virginia in the US and
Chongquing in China. Projects in ramp-up phase not only have higher costs associated with optimizing the
production process in early stages of a project, but they also are characterized by lower volumes as orders
ramp up to planned levels. These effects were substantially higher in the first quarter of 2013 compared to
the first quarter of 2012.

We anticipated the reduction of revenue and EBITDA in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first
quarter of 2012 in our budgeting process which contemplated fewer working days and a reduction in
revenue in Western Europe in the first quarter of 2013, as well as the effects of projects in construction and
the ramp up described above. We have elected not to adopt extraordinary cost-cutting measures in Western
Europe in response to the recent market contraction as we expect a market recovery during the second half
of 2013. Industry sources estimate that there was a 12.7% decline in car production in Western Europe for
the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. However, the same industry sources expect
the decline in the first quarter in Western Europe to decelerate in the following quarters, and forecast an
increase in production of 3.1% for the fourth quarter of 2013.

Our actual financial results for the first quarter of 2013 may differ from our preliminary estimated results
and remain subject to our normal internal accounting review for quarterly results.

_Mitsui Investment in our American Operations_

On January 4, 2013 we entered into an investment agreement with Mitsui according to which Mitsui will
acquire a 30% minority stake in our operations in North and South America by investing A297.0 million in
newly issued shares of Gestamp North America, Inc., Gestamp 2015, S.L., Gestamp 2016, S.L. and
Gestamp Brasil Industria de Autope¸cas, S.A. (collectively the ‘‘Holdcos’’), our US, Mexican, Argentinian
and Brazilian sub-holding companies, respectively (the ‘‘Mitsui Investment’’). The completion of the
Mitsui Investment is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including obtaining certain
regulatory approvals and our acquisition of the 35% interest in our Mexican subsidiaries that we do not
currently own from a Spanish quasi-governmental entity which supports foreign investment (Compa˜n´ıa
Espa˜nola de Financiaci´on del Desarrollo, COFIDES S.A., or ‘‘Cofides’’), which is expected to close before
the end of June 2013.

The alliance with Mitsui, one of the largest Japanese industrial and financial groups with a proven
reputation established over the course of its almost 140 year history, represents a major backing of our
strategy. Mitsui operates in 67 countries and employs over 44,000 people worldwide. In the nine months to
December 31, 2012, Mitsui’s revenue was $57.1 billion. The partnership with Mitsui will not only reinforce
our presence in the important markets in North and South America, but we believe it will also substantially
enhance our relationships with Japanese OEMs.

In addition, Mitsui, with its strong presence in relevant sectors such as logistics, steel and other raw
materials, and in finance, among others, will make a strong positive contribution to the growth and
consolidation of our business in North and South America.

_Repurchase of 35% Minority Interest in our Mexican Operations_

We have agreed with the management of Cofides to repurchase the 35% interest that we currently do not
own in our Mexican operations for an aggregate estimated consideration of between A60.0 to A70.0 million.
This acquisition is expected to close before the end of June 2013 (the ‘‘Mexican Interest Repurchase’’). We
intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to fund the Mexican Interest
Repurchase. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’.

future debt of Gestamp Automoci´on that is not
subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee;

                - are and will be effectively senior in right of payment to any

Guarantee;

                - are and will be structurally subordinated to all existing and
future debt of any subsidiaries of Gestamp Automoci´on
that do not guarantee the notes (other than the Issuer).

See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
Agreement’’ for a description of certain terms affecting the
notes and the Guarantees, including provisions relating to the
release of Guarantees and turnover of proceeds following an
enforcement event under the Intercreditor Agreement and
‘‘Annex B : Intercreditor Agreement’’.

As of December 31, 2012, after giving pro forma effect to this
offering, the entering into of the Senior Facilities Agreement,
the Mitsui Investment and the application of the estimated
proceeds therefrom (i) we would have had outstanding
A1,835.4 million of indebtedness, including the notes, and (ii) the
subsidiaries of Gestamp Automoci´on that will not guarantee the
notes would have had A232.2 million of debt. See ‘‘Description
of Other Indebtedness’’. The Issuer would have had no debt
other than the notes.

The Issuer is a special purpose finance subsidiary and has no
assets or operations, other than in connection with the issuance
of the notes. Gestamp Automoci´on is a holding company
conducting its operations primarily through its subsidiaries.

**Intercreditor Agreement . . . . . . . . . .** The first-ranking charges over the shares of certain subsidiaries
of Gestamp Automoci´on have also been granted to secure
indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the
notes. These intercreditor relationships are governed by
the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the notes and
Guarantees will share on a _pro rata basis recoveries received_
upon enforcement over any such share charges constituting
Collateral with the secured creditors under the Senior Facilities
Agreement and certain of our Existing Debt Facilities.

**Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer may redeem all or part of the notes at any time on or
after May 31, 2016 at the redemption prices described in
‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption’’.

At any time prior to May 31, 2016 the Issuer may also redeem all
or part of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a ‘‘make whole’’
premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.

At any time prior to May 31, 2016 the Issuer may redeem up to
35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Euro notes with
the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a
redemption price equal to 105.875% of their principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
to the redemption date, provided that at least 65% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes remains
outstanding after the redemption.

35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar notes with
the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a
redemption price equal to 105.625% of their principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
to the redemption date, provided that at least 65% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Dollar notes remains
outstanding after the redemption.

**Optional Tax Redemption . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer may redeem the notes in whole, but not in part, at
any time, if changes in tax laws would require the Issuer to pay
additional amounts on the notes. If the Issuer decides to redeem
the notes following such a change in tax laws, the Issuer must
redeem the notes at a price equal to the principal amount of the
notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts,
if any, to the date of redemption and certain other amounts. See
‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional Tax Redemption’’.

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . .** All payments in respect of the notes or any Guarantee will be
made without withholding or deduction on account of taxes
unless required by law. If an applicable withholding agent is
required by law to withhold or deduct any amount for taxes
imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined herein) in
respect of payments on the notes or any Guarantee, subject to
certain exceptions, we will pay the additional amounts necessary
so that the net amount received by the beneficial owners of
notes after the withholding or deduction (including any
withholding or deduction attributable to the additional amounts)
will equal the amounts that would have been received had there
been no deduction or withholding. See ‘‘Description of the
Notes—Additional Amounts’’.

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If we experience specific kinds of changes in control, the Issuer
may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a
redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Repurchase at
the Option of Holders—Change of Control’’.

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture governing the notes will, among other things,
limit our ability to:

(3) ‘‘EBITDA’’ represents operating profit before depreciation, amortization and impairment losses. Our management believes that
EBITDA is meaningful for investors because it provides an analysis of our operating results, profitability and ability to service
debt and because EBITDA is used by our chief operating decision makers to track our business evolution, establish operational
and strategic targets and make important business decisions. EBITDA is also a measure commonly reported and widely used by
analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry. To facilitate the analysis of our operations, this indicator excludes
amortization, impairment and depreciation expenses from operating profit in order to eliminate the impact of general
long-term capital investment. Although we are presenting this measure to enhance the understanding of our historical operating
performance, EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to operating profit as an indicator of our operating
performance, or an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The following table presents
the calculation of this measure:

(5) We define acquisitions net of disposals to include cash flows used in investments in group companies and associates less cash
flows from divestments of group companies and associates.

(6) Total financial debt consists of interest-bearing loans and borrowings, financial leasing, borrowings from associated companies,
loans from the Ministry of Science and Technology and other interest bearing loans but does not include derivative financial

period the financial expenses associated with the notes (using actual rates and excluding the amortization of issuance costs) and
the Senior Facilities (using actual rates, including undrawn commitment fees), and by deducting from financial expenses the
financial expenses associated with the debt being repaid in connection with this offering using an estimated interest rate for the
period. We have not made any adjustments as a result of the increased cash on balance sheet. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds,’’

**RISK FACTORS**

_The following summarizes certain risks involved in an investment in the notes that may materially affect our_
_ability to pay the interest, principal and premium, if any, on the notes. There may be additional risks that we do_
_not currently know of or that we currently deem immaterial based on information available to us. Our business,_
_financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks._

**Risks related to our Business**

**_The weakness in the global economy, the global credit markets and the financial services industry over the past_**
**_several years has severely and negatively affected demand for automobiles and automotive parts and continued_**
**_weakness or a worsening of economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_profitability._**

Demand for and pricing of our products are subject to economic and political conditions and other factors
present in the various domestic and international markets where our products are sold. The level of
demand for our products depends primarily upon the level of consumer demand for new vehicles that are
manufactured with our products.

The global economic crisis has resulted in delayed and reduced purchases of durable consumer goods, such
as automobiles. Although the global economic climate improved during 2011 and 2012, the global economy
has not recovered to levels previously experienced and remains fragile. If the global economy were to take
another significant downturn, depending upon its length, duration and severity, our business, financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flow would again be materially adversely affected.

**_The continuation or worsening of the European ‘‘sovereign debt crisis’’ could intensify the risks faced by the_**
**_automotive industry and our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial_**
**_condition and profitability._**

As a result of the continuing credit crisis in Europe and the widespread concern about the ability of several
European governments to repay their debt, particularly in Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and
Spain, in March 2011, the European Council agreed on the need for Eurozone countries to establish a
permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism (the ‘‘ESM’’), to assume the role of the
European Financial Stability Facility and the European Financial Stability Mechanism in providing
external financial assistance to Eurozone countries after June 2013.

On February 2, 2012, the Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism (the ‘‘ESM Treaty’’) was
signed by each Member State of the countries that utilize the Euro as an official currency (the
‘‘Eurozone’’). The ESM Treaty includes a package of measures, including the provision of financial
assistance to its signatories experiencing or being threatened by severe financing problems, where such
financial assistance is necessary for the safeguarding of financial stability in the Eurozone as a whole, and
entered into force on September 27, 2012.

On March 2, 2012, a new fiscal compact, the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the
Economic Monetary Union (the ‘‘Fiscal Compact’’), was signed by all Member States of the European
Union (the ‘‘Member States’’) (except the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom) and entered into
force on January 1, 2013. To date, the European Council had received 10 ratification instruments from
Eurozone countries. The Fiscal Compact places deficit restrictions on Member State budgets (other than
the United Kingdom and Czech Republic), with associated sanctions for those Member States that violate
the specified limits.

Despite these measures, conditions in Europe have resulted in increased volatility in global capital
markets, as well as lower consumer confidence, which could continue for the foreseeable future. Western
Europe and Eastern Europe accounted for approximately 56% and 9%, respectively, of our consolidated
revenues (based on manufacturing origin of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2012. In these
circumstances, many of the risks faced by the automotive industry and our business could intensify, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows as well as negatively impact our access to, and cost of, capital.

**_An unanticipated deterioration of economic conditions, which may include the failure of one or more major_**
**_financial institutions, could adversely affect the amount of credit available to us, result in depletion of our cash_**
**_resources and subject us to counterparty risk in connection with derivative transactions, each of which could have a_**
**_material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition._**

Uncertain economic conditions create significant planning risks for us. The occurrence of an economic
shock not contemplated in our business plan, a rapid deterioration of economic conditions or a more
prolonged recession than that experienced during the global economic crisis could result in the depletion
of our cash resources. Notwithstanding that we have a diverse group of financial institutions acting as
providers of credit to our business, the failure of a financial institution in which we invest our cash reserves
or that is a counterparty in a derivatives transaction with us, could increase the risk that our cash reserves
and amounts owing to us pursuant to derivative transactions may not be fully recoverable. Each of these
factors could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.

**_Deterioration in the world economies could exacerbate the difficulties experienced by our customers and suppliers in_**
**_obtaining financing, which, in turn, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results_**
**_of operations and cash flows._**

Lending institutions have suffered and may continue to suffer losses due to their lending and other
financial relationships, especially because of the general weakening of the global economy and the
increased financial instability of many borrowers. Longer-term disruptions in the credit markets could
further adversely affect our customers by making it increasingly difficult for them to obtain financing for
their businesses and for their customers to obtain financing for automobile purchases. Our OEM
customers typically require significant financing for their respective businesses. In addition, our OEM
customers typically have related finance companies that provide financing to their dealers and customers.
These finance companies have historically been active participants in the securitization markets, which
have experienced severe disruptions during the global economic crisis. Our suppliers, as well as the other
suppliers to our customers, may face similar difficulties in obtaining financing for their businesses. If
capital is not available to our customers and suppliers, or if its cost is prohibitively high, their businesses
would be negatively impacted, which could result in their restructuring or even reorganization/liquidation
under applicable bankruptcy laws. Any such negative impact, in turn, could materially and negatively affect
our company either through the loss of revenues to any of our customers so affected, or due to our inability
to meet our commitments without excess expense resulting from disruptions in supply caused by the
suppliers so affected.

Financial difficulties experienced by any major customer could have a material adverse impact on us if such
customer were unable to pay for the products we provide, materially reduced its capital expenditure on,
and resulting demand for, new product lines, or we otherwise experienced a loss of, or material reduction
in, business from such customer. As a result of such difficulties, we could experience lost revenues,
significant write-offs of accounts receivable, significant impairment charges or additional restructurings
beyond the steps we have taken to date.

**_The automobile industry is highly cyclical and cyclical downturns in our business segments negatively impact our_**
**_business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

The volume of automotive production and the level of new vehicle purchases regionally and worldwide are
cyclical and have fluctuated, sometimes significantly from year-to-year. These fluctuations are caused by
such factors as general economic conditions, interest rates, consumer confidence, consumer preferences,
patterns of consumer spending, fuel costs and the automobile replacement cycle, and such fluctuations give
rise to changes in demand for our products and may have a significant adverse impact on our results of
operations.

The highly cyclical and fluctuating nature of the automotive industry presents a risk that is outside our
control and that cannot be accurately predicted. Moreover, a number of factors that we cannot predict can
and have impacted cyclicality in the past. Decreases in demand for automobiles generally, or in the
demand for our products in particular, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

21


-----

**_We are dependent on large customers for current and future revenues. The loss of any of these customers or the loss_**
**_of market share by these customers could have a material adverse impact on us._**

Although we supply our products to several of the leading automobile manufacturers, as is common in our
industry we depend on certain large-value customers for a significant proportion of our revenues. For
example, during 2012, Volkswagen, Renault-Nissan, Peugeot, Daimler and General Motors represented
approximately 30.2%, 11.2%, 9.9%, 9.6% and 9.2% of our revenues, respectively. The loss of all or a
substantial portion of our sales to any of our large-volume customers could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by reducing cash flows and by
limiting our ability to spread our fixed costs over a larger revenue base. We may make fewer sales to these
customers for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:

- loss of awarded business;

- reduced or delayed customer requirements;

- OEMs’ insourcing business they have traditionally outsourced to us;

- strikes or other work stoppages affecting production by our customers;

- bankruptcy or insolvency of a customer; or

- reduced demand for our customers’ products.

See also ‘‘—Deterioration in the world economies could exacerbate the difficulties experienced by our
customers and suppliers in obtaining financing, which, in turn, could materially and adversely impact our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows’’.

**_Our inability to realize revenues represented by our awarded business or termination or non-renewal of production_**
**_purchase orders by our customers could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results_**
**_of operations and cash flows._**

The realization of future revenues from awarded business is inherently subject to a number of important
risks and uncertainties, including the number of vehicles that our customers will actually produce and the
timing of that production.

Typically the terms and conditions of the agreements with our customers do not include a commitment
regarding minimum volumes of purchases from us. In addition, such contracts typically provide that
customers have the contractual right to unilaterally terminate our contracts with them with no notice or
limited notice. If such contracts are terminated by our customers, our ability to obtain compensation from
our customers for such termination is generally limited to the direct out-of-pocket costs that we incurred
for raw materials and work-in-progress and in certain instances undepreciated capital expenditures.
Further, there is no guarantee that our customers will renew their purchase orders with us. We cannot
assure you that our results of operations will not be materially adversely impacted in the future if we are
unable to realize revenues from our awarded business, if our customers cancel awarded business or if our
customers fail to renew their contracts with us.

**_Disruptions in the automotive supply chain could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial_**
**_condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

The automotive supply chain is subject to disruptions because we, along with our customers and suppliers,
attempt to maintain low inventory levels. In addition, our plants are typically located in close proximity to
our customers.

Disruptions could be caused by a multitude of potential problems, such as closures of one of our or our
suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages,
fires, explosions or political upheaval, as well as logistical complications due to weather, earthquakes, or
other natural or nuclear disasters, mechanical failures, delayed customs processing and more.

Additionally, if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production, the customer may seek to
recoup all of its losses and expenses from us. Any disruptions affecting us or caused by us could have a
material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

22


-----

**_The inability for us, our customers or our suppliers to obtain and maintain sufficient capital financing, including_**
**_working capital lines, and credit insurance may adversely affect our, our customers’ and our suppliers’ liquidity and_**
**_financial condition._**

Our working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the level, variability and
timing of our customers’ worldwide vehicle production and the payment terms with our customers and
suppliers. Our liquidity could also be adversely impacted if our suppliers were to suspend normal trade
credit terms and require payment in advance or payment on delivery. If our available cash flows from
operations are not sufficient to fund our ongoing cash needs, we would be required to look to our cash
balances and availability for borrowings under our credit facilities to satisfy those needs, as well as
potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms and in adequate
amounts, if at all.

There can be no assurance that we, our customers and our suppliers will continue to have such ability. This
may increase the risk that we cannot produce our products or will have to pay higher prices for our inputs.
These higher prices may not be recovered in our selling prices.

Our suppliers often seek to obtain credit insurance based on the strength of the financial condition of our
subsidiary with the payment obligation, which may be less robust than our consolidated financial condition.
If we were to experience liquidity issues, our suppliers may not be able to obtain credit insurance and in
turn would likely not be able to offer us payment terms that we have historically received. Our failure to
receive such terms from our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.

**_The volatility of steel prices may adversely affect our results of operations._**

The primary raw material used in our business is steel, which in recent years has represented
approximately 50% of our sales. In 2012, approximately 65% of our steel was purchased through OEM
re-sale programs, with the remainder of our steel purchasing requirements in 2012 was met through
contracts with steel suppliers that we negotiated.

An increase or decrease in steel prices affects our results. Although we have sought to be largely neutral
with respect to steel pricing’s impact on our margins over time as a result of our steel pricing
arrangements, there is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve that goal. Most of our steel purchasing
contracts that we negotiate directly with suppliers and that are not under OEM re-sale programs do not
have any contractual provisions for pass through of the price of steel to the OEMs. Although historically
and consistent with automotive industry standards, we have been able to negotiate with our OEM
customers to pass through the impact of price swings leaving us protected from changing steel prices,
however, there are no assurances that this will continue in the future.

We typically sell scrap steel in secondary markets in which, typically, the price of scrap steel fluctuates in
line with fluctuations in steel prices. We generally share our recoveries from sales of scrap steel with our
OEM customers either through scrap sharing agreements, in cases where we are on resale programs, or in
the product pricing that we negotiate with OEMs regarding increases and decreases in the steel price in
cases where we purchase steel directly from the mills. We may be impacted by the fluctuation in scrap steel
prices, either positive or negative, in relation to our various customer agreements. If costs of raw materials
and energy continue to rise, and if we are not able to undertake cost saving measures elsewhere in our
operations or increase the selling prices of our products, we will not able to compensate such cost
increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We may have difficulty competing favorably in the highly competitive automotive parts industry generally and in_**
**_certain product or geographic areas specifically._**

The automotive parts industry is highly competitive. Although the overall number of competitors has
decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation, we face significant competition within each of our major
product areas, including from new competitors entering the markets that we serve, and OEMs that may
seek to integrate vertically. The principal competitive factors include price, quality, global presence,
service, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation and timely
delivery. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete favorably in these competitive
markets or that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business by reducing
our ability to increase or maintain sales and profit margins.

23


-----

We principally compete for new business projects at the beginning of the development of new models and
upon the redesign of existing models by major OEM customers. In some cases, a number of our major
OEM customers manufacture products that we currently produce, thereby eliminating an opportunity for
us to bid for the production. New model development generally begins three to five years prior to the
marketing of such models to the public. Redesign of existing models begins during the life cycle of a
platform, usually at least two to three years before the end of the platform’s life cycle. The failure to obtain
new business projects on new models or to retain or increase business projects on redesigned existing
models, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In
addition, as a result of the relatively long lead times required for many of our structural components, it
may be difficult in the short-term for us to obtain new revenues to replace any unexpected decline in the
sale of existing products.

**_Shifts in market shares among vehicles or vehicle segments or shifts away from vehicles on which we have_**
**_significant content could have a material adverse effect on our profitability._**

While we supply parts for a wide variety of vehicles produced globally, we do not supply parts for all
vehicles produced, nor is the number or value of parts evenly distributed among the vehicles for which we
do supply parts. Shifts in market shares among vehicles or vehicle segments, particularly shifts away from
vehicles on which we have significant content and shifts away from vehicle segments in which our sales may
be more heavily concentrated, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.

**_Our inability to offset price concessions or additional costs from our customers could have an adverse effect on our_**
**_profitability._**

We face ongoing pricing pressure, as well as pressure to absorb costs related to product design, engineering
and tooling, as well as other items previously paid for directly by OEMs. Typically, in line with our industry
practice, our customers benefit from price reductions during the life cycle of a contract. We expect to offset
these price concessions by achieving production efficiencies, however, we cannot guarantee that we will do
so. If we fail to achieve production efficiencies to fully offset price concessions or do not otherwise offset
such price concessions, our profitability and results of operations would be adversely affected.

**_We may incur material costs related to plant closings, which could have a material adverse impact on our business,_**
**_financial condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

If we are forced to close manufacturing locations because of loss of business or consolidation of
manufacturing facilities, the employee severance, asset retirement and other costs, including
reimbursement costs relating to public subsidies, to close these facilities may be significant. In certain
locations that are subject to leases, we may continue to incur material costs consistent with the initial lease
terms. We continually attempt to align production capacity with demand; therefore, we cannot assure you
that additional plants will not have to be closed.

**_The construction and maintenance of our facilities entails certain risks._**

The construction and maintenance of our facilities entails certain difficulties, both from a technical
perspective as well as in terms of the timing of the various construction phases. A number of problems may
arise in relation to our facilities, such as interruptions or delays due to failed deliveries by suppliers or
manufacturers, problems with connecting to the utilities networks, construction faults, problems linked to
the operation of equipment, adverse weather conditions, unexpected delays in obtaining or sourcing
permits and authorizations, or longer-than-expected periods for technical adjustments. The additional
costs that may arise in the maintenance of facilities may adversely affect our business operations, financial
position and operational results.

**_Mechanical failure, equipment shutdowns and technological breakdown could adversely affect our business._**

We are subject to mechanical failure and equipment shutdowns which may be beyond our control. If a
section of one of our facilities is damaged or shuts down, it could cause a mechanical failure or equipment
shutdown in other components of such facility. If such events occur, our production capacity may be
materially and adversely impacted. In the event that we are forced to shut down any of our sites for a
significant period of time, it would have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial
position and operational results.

24


-----

**_Interruptions in the supply of utilities to our facilities may negatively affect our operations_**

We are reliant upon a continuous and uninterrupted supply of electricity, gas and water to our facilities to
ensure the continued operation of our production lines and supply chain. An interruption to the supply of
any of these utilities, even in the short term, including but not limited to a trip in the electricity grid, a gas
leak or issues with local water mains, could cause equipment shutdowns, mechanical failures and/or
damage to our facilities and equipment which could materially and adversely impact our business
operations, operational results and financial position.

**_Our ongoing operations may require increased capital expenditure at certain stages that will consume cash from our_**
**_operations and borrowings._**

In order to maintain our product lines for existing products, from time to time, we are required to make
certain operational and maintenance-related capital expenditure on our facilities. Our ability to undertake
such operational and maintenance measures largely depends on our cash flow from our operations and
access to capital. We intend to continue to fund our cash needs through cash flow from operations.
However, there may be unforeseen capital expenditure needs for which we may not have adequate capital.
The timing of capital expenditures also may cause fluctuations in our operational results.

**_Our profitability may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties._**

From time to time we are awarded new or takeover business by our customers. The launch of new business
is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the production
readiness of our and our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes, as well as factors
related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Our failure to
successfully launch material new or takeover business could have an adverse effect on our profitability.

**_There are integration and consolidation risks associated with potential future acquisitions and divestitures. Future_**
**_acquisitions and divestment may result in significant transaction expenses, unexpected liabilities and a negative_**
**_impact on operations and/or cash flows. Future acquisitions may result in risks associated with entering new_**
**_markets, and we may be unable to profitably operate the acquired businesses._**

We have a history of making strategic acquisitions and divestitures and in the future we may consider and
make further strategic acquisitions of suitable acquisition candidates in markets where we currently
operate as well as in markets in which we have not previously operated. We may also consider and make
strategic divestitures where this is in line with our strategy.

However, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future, or may not be able to
finance such acquisitions on favorable terms. We may lack sufficient management, financial and other
resources to successfully integrate future acquisitions or to ensure that such future acquisitions will
perform as planned or prove to be beneficial to our operations. Acquisitions and divestitures involve
numerous other risks, including the diversion of our management’s attention from other business concerns,
undisclosed risks impacting the target and potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with
current customers and suppliers. In addition, any acquisitions or divestitures could impact our financial
position, cash-flow or create dilution for our stockholders. In certain transactions, our acquisition analysis
includes assumptions regarding the consolidation of operations and improved operating cost structures for
the combined operations. Such synergies or benefits may not be achieved on the assumed time schedule or
in the assumed amount, if at all. Any future acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses,
unexpected liabilities and risks associated with entering new markets in addition to the integration and
consolidation risks.

As a result of our acquisitions or divestments, we may assume continuing obligations, deferred payments
and liabilities. Any past or future acquisitions may result in exposure to third parties for liabilities, such as
liability for faulty work done by the acquired business and liability of the acquired business or assets that
may or may not be adequately covered by insurance or by indemnification, if any, from the former owners
of the acquired business or assets. The occurrence of any of these liabilities could have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations.

**_We do not control certain of our joint ventures._**

We have a number of strategic partnerships and joint ventures and alliances in which we hold a
non-controlling interest. For example, we have entered into a Turkish joint venture in Bey¸celik in which we

25


-----

have a 50% interest. We also hold 50% interests in several entities in India and China. There can be no
assurance that the arrangements will be successful and/or achieve their planned objectives. The
performance of all such operations in which we do not have a controlling interest will depend on the
financial and strategic support of the other shareholders. Such other shareholders may make ill-informed
or inadequate management decisions, or may fail to supply or be unwilling to supply the required
operational, strategic and financial resources, which could materially adversely affect these operations. If
any of our strategic partners were to encounter financial difficulties, change their business strategies or no
longer be willing to participate in these strategic partnerships, joint ventures and alliances, our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Moreover, in some of these businesses, we may not have the power to control the payment of dividends or
other distributions, so even if the business is performing well, we may not be able to receive payment of our
share of any profits. Finally, there could be circumstances in which we may wish or be required to acquire
the ownership interests of our partners, and there can be no assurance that we will have access to the funds
necessary to do so, on commercially reasonably terms or at all.

**_The estimates of our return on investment may be inaccurate which could negatively impact upon our results._**

While returns on investments are not guaranteed, in assessing a new investment or acquisition, as part of
our internal decision making methodology, one of the factors we consider is whether we believe that the
investment may result in an internal rate of return to us of approximately 15%. Due to a number of the risk
factors set out in this section, our investment methodology may prove to be materially inaccurate which
could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

**_The value of our deferred tax assets could become impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our_**
**_operating results._**

As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately A174.3 million in net deferred income tax assets. These
deferred tax assets include net operating loss carry forwards that can be used to offset taxable income in
future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods. We periodically determine the
probability of the realization of deferred tax assets, using significant judgments and estimates with respect
to, among other things, historical operating results, expectations of future earnings and tax planning
strategies. If we determine in the future that there is not sufficient positive evidence to support the
valuation of these assets, due to the factors described above or other factors, we may be required to adjust
the valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in material
non-cash expenses in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carry forwards may
be limited and delayed. In addition, adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of
our operations in several foreign jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against
deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial results.

On April 15, 2013 the Spanish Tax Administration concluded the tax audit of our subsidiary, Gestamp
Servicios, S.A. Among other things, the Spanish tax authority reviewed the corporate income tax for the
fiscal years 2007 to 2010, which resulted in the reduction of some of the deferred tax assets recorded in our
subsidiary’s financial statements. The above-mentioned figure of A174.3 million includes the result of the
tax audit. In particular, within the scope of the tax audit, the Spanish tax authorities have reviewed the
transfer pricing policy and the documentation of the group and no significant contingency from transfer
pricing has been identified.

**_We have a material amount of goodwill, which, if it becomes impaired, would result in a reduction in our net income_**
**_and equity._**

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
IFRS requires that goodwill be periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of the
reporting unit. Declines in our profitability or the value of comparable companies may impact the fair
value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of goodwill and a reduction in net income.

As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately A136.2 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance
sheet that could be subject to impairment. In addition, if we acquire new businesses in the future, we may
recognize additional goodwill, which could be significant. We could also be required to recognize
additional impairments in the future and such an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect
on our financial position and results of operations in the period of recognition.

26


-----

**_We are subject to risks related to our international operations._**

Our international operations include manufacturing facilities in, among other locations, Brazil, China,
India, Russia and Mexico, and we sell our products in each of these areas. For the year ended
December 31, 2012, approximately 33.8% of our revenues were derived from operations in growth
economies. International operations are subject to various risks that could have a material adverse effect
on those operations and our business as a whole, including but not limited to:

- exposure to local economic and social conditions, including logistical and communication challenges;

- exposure to local political conditions, including political disputes, coups, the risk of seizure of assets by
a foreign government, increased risk of fraud and political corruption, terrorism, acts or war or similar
events;

- exposure to local public health issues and the resultant impact on economic and political conditions;

- exposure to potentially undeveloped legal systems which make it difficult to enforce contractual rights
and to potentially adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices;

- exposure to local tax requirements and obligations;

- foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls;

- greater risk of uncontrollable accounts and longer collection cycles;

- the risk of government-sponsored competition;

- controls on the repatriation of cash, including the imposition or increase of withholding and other
taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries; and

- export and import restrictions.

**_We are exposed to risks in relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations and economic sanction_**
**_programs_**

Our international operations require us to comply with the laws and regulations of various jurisdictions. In
particular, our international operations are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, and economic
sanction programs, including those administered by the UN, EU and Office of Foreign Asset Control in
the United States. These laws prohibit improper business conduct and restrict us from dealing with certain
sanctioned countries.

As a result of our international operations, we are exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws and
sanctions regulations applicable in those countries where we operate. Some of the countries in which we
operate lack as developed a legal system as other locations and are perceived to have high levels of
corruption. Our continued geographical diversification, including in growth economies, development of
joint venture relationships worldwide and our employment of local agents in the countries in which we
operate increases the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, sanctions, or similar laws. Violations of
anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial
of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts (and termination
of existing contracts) and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment.
In addition, any major violations could have a significant impact on our reputation and consequently on
our ability to win future business.

We have policies and procedures designed to assist our compliance with applicable laws and regulations
including training of our employees to comply with such laws and regulations. While we have a strong
culture of compliance and have adequate systems of control, we seek to continuously improve our systems
of internal controls, to remedy any weaknesses that are identified through appropriate corrective action
depending on the circumstances, including additional training, improvement of internal controls and
oversight, and deployment of additional resources and to take appropriate action in case of any breach of
our rules and procedures which might include disciplinary measures, suspensions of employees and
ultimately termination of such employees. There can be no assurance, however, that our policies and
procedures will be followed at all times or will effectively detect and prevent violations of the applicable
laws by one or more of our employees, consultants, agents or partners and, as a result, we could be subject
to penalties and material adverse consequences on its business, financial condition or results of operations
if it failed to prevent any such violations.

**_Foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause a decline in our financial condition, results of operations and cash_**
**_flows._**

Although our reporting currency is the Euro, a portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in
other currencies, such as the Chinese Yuen or the Russian Ruble. In the year ended December 31, 2012,
A3,171.9 million of our revenues (which represented approximately 55.1% of our revenue for that period),
on a consolidated basis, were generated in currencies other than the Euro.

We are subject to risk if the foreign currency in which our costs are paid appreciates against the currency in
which we generate revenues because the appreciation effectively increases our cost in that country. The
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of some of our operating entities are reported in
foreign currencies and then translated into Euros at the applicable foreign exchange rate for inclusion in
our consolidated financial statements. As a result, appreciation of the Euro against these foreign
currencies generally will have a negative impact on our reported sales and profits while depreciation of the
Euro against these foreign currencies will generally have a positive effect on reported revenues and profits.

Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the
relative values of the Chinese Yuan or the Russian Ruble could have an adverse effect on our profitability
and financial condition and any sustained change in such relative currency values could adversely impact
our competitiveness in certain geographic regions.

Economic instability in the countries in which we operate where the Euro is not the local currency and the
related decline in the value of the relevant local currency in these countries could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In jurisdictions where the prevailing currency is subject to significant volatility, in the contracts we enter
into in these jurisdictions we seek to nominate an alternative functional currency, typically either the Euro
or U.S. Dollar, to seek to minimize the impact of any exchange rate fluctuations. In the year ended
December 31, 2012, we made a loss of A26.4 million on foreign exchange rate translations to our reporting
currency.

**_Our hedging and other derivative arrangements may not effectively or sufficiently offset the negative impact of_**
**_foreign exchange rate fluctuations._**

We may use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to protect against
certain foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset
more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from foreign currency variations. Gains or
losses associated with hedging activities also may negatively impact operating results.

**_We have invested substantial resources in markets where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our_**
**_strategies should such expectations not be realized._**

Our future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product
development and manufacturing capacity in areas where we can support our customer base. We have
identified certain markets including the US, Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, China, India and Thailand as
key markets where we are likely to experience substantial growth, and accordingly have made and expect to
continue to make substantial investments, both directly and through participation in various partnerships
and joint ventures to support anticipated growth in those regions. If we are unable to deepen existing and
develop additional customer relationships in these regions, we may not only fail to realize expected rates of
return on our existing investments, but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely
redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets, potentially resulting in lost market share
to our competitors. Our results will also suffer if these regions do not grow as quickly as we anticipate.

**_Changes in our mix of earnings between jurisdictions with lower tax rates and those with higher tax rates could have_**
**_a material adverse effect on our profitability._**

Our effective tax rate varies in each country in which we conduct business. Changes in our mix of earnings
between jurisdictions with lower tax rates and those with higher tax rates could have a material adverse
effect on our profitability.

28


-----

**_Our profitability may be materially adversely affected by our inability to utilize tax losses or because of tax exposures_**
**_we face._**

We have incurred losses in some countries which we may not be able to fully or partially offset against
income we have earned in those countries. In some cases, we may not be able to utilize these losses at all if
we cannot generate profits in those countries or if we have ceased conducting business in those countries
altogether. Our inability to utilize material tax losses could materially adversely affect our profitability. At
any given time, we may face other tax exposures arising out of changes in tax laws, tax reassessments or
otherwise. To the extent we cannot implement measures to offset these exposures, they may have a
material adverse effect on our profitability.

**_Loss of key executives and failure to attract qualified management could limit our growth and negatively impact our_**
**_operations._**

We have a management team with a substantial amount of expertise in the automotive industry. Loss of
key members of management could result in the loss of valuable customer relationships and/or less or
unsuccessful implementation of strategies.

**_Availability of labor in some of the areas in which we operate could negatively impact our operations_**

When establishing and operating facilities in some growth economies, we may encounter difficulties with
the availability of labor. In some instances we may compete with our customers for qualified employees in
a limited labor pool of adequately trained workers. Performing work in these areas and under these
circumstances can slow our progress, potentially causing us to incur contractual liabilities to our customers.
These circumstances may also cause us to incur additional, unanticipated costs that we might not be able to
pass on to our customers.

**_Our profitability could be negatively impacted if we are not able to maintain appropriate utilization of our_**
**_workforce._**

The extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability. If we under-utilize our workforce,
our project profits and overall profitability suffer in the short-term. If we over-utilize our workforce, we
may negatively impact safety, employee satisfaction and project execution, which could result in a decline
of future project awards. The utilization of our workforce is impacted by numerous factors including:

- our estimate of the headcount requirements for various manufacturing units based upon our forecast
of the demand for our products;

- our ability to maintain our talent base and manage attrition;

- our ability to schedule our portfolio of projects to efficiently utilize our employees and minimize
production downtime;

- our need to invest time and resources into functions such as training, business development, employee
recruiting, and sales that are not chargeable to customer projects; and

- the degree of structural flexibility of labor laws in countries where our employees are located.

**_The workforce in the automotive industry is highly unionized and if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective_**
**_bargaining agreements with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our employees, or our customers’_**
**_employees, engage in work stoppages and other labor problems, this could result in a material adverse effect._**

As of December 31, 2012, we had 30,313 employees, the majority of whom were covered under collective
bargaining agreements on a plant-by-plant basis and that expire at various times. In addition, we have
specific exposure to labor strikes in our international operations related primarily to the economic
instability in several countries in the European Union. If major work disruptions involving our employees
were to occur, our business could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including a loss of revenues,
increased costs and reduced profitability. We cannot assure you that we will not experience a material
labor disruption at one or more of our facilities in the future in the course of renegotiation of our labor
arrangements or otherwise. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate
our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate
any of our collective bargaining agreements or are only able to renegotiate them on terms that are less
favorable to us, we may need to incur additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

29


-----

Further, many of the manufacturing facilities of our customers and suppliers are unionized and are subject
to the risk of labor disruptions from time to time. A significant labor disruption could lead to a lengthy
shutdown of our customers’ or our suppliers’ production lines, which could have a material adverse effect
on our operations and profitability.

**_A shift away from technologies in which we invest could have a material adverse affect on our profitability and_**
**_financial condition._**

Our business requires a high level of technical expertise for the development and manufacture of our
products. We invest in technology and innovation which we believe will be critical to our long-term growth
and we need to continually adapt our expertise in response to technological innovations, industry
standards, product instructions and customer requirements. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology
and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products or manufacturing processes on a
timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive. New technologies or changes in
industry and customer requirements may render one or more of our current offerings obsolete, excessively
costly or otherwise unmarketable. If there is a shift away from the use of technologies in which we are
investing, our costs may not be fully recovered. We may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if other
technologies emerge as industry-leading technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our
prospects for growth, profitability and financial condition.

**_Legal or regulatory claims or investigations against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial_**
**_position._**

From time to time, we may become involved in legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or investigations,
including by governmental bodies, customers, suppliers, former employees, class action plaintiffs and
others. On an ongoing basis, we attempt to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to
these proceedings or claims, although it is difficult to predict final outcomes with any degree of certainty.

Except as disclosed from time to time in our consolidated financial statements, we do not believe that any
of the proceedings or claims to which we are party will result in costs, charges or liabilities that will have a
material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we cannot assure you that the costs, charges
and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities
will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements. In future periods,
we could be subject to cash costs or non-cash charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved
unfavorably to us.

**_Product liability claims and warranty and recall costs could cause us to incur losses and damage our reputation._**

Many of our products are critical to the structural integrity of a vehicle. As such, we face an inherent
business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event of the failure of our products to perform to
specifications, or if our products are alleged to result in property damage, bodily injury or death. We are
generally required under our customer contracts to indemnify our customers for product liability claims in
respect of our products. Accordingly, we may be materially and adversely impacted by product liability
claims.

If any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall
involving those products. In addition, our customers demand that we bear the cost of the repair and
replacement of defective products which are either covered under their warranty or are the subject of a
recall by them. Warranty provisions are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to
settle existing or probable claims on product defect issues. Recall costs are costs incurred when
government regulators or our customers decide to recall a product due to a known or suspected
performance issue and we are required to participate either voluntarily or involuntarily. Currently, under
most customer agreements, we only account for existing or probable warranty claims. Under certain
complete vehicle engineering and assembly contracts, we record an estimate of future warranty-related
costs based on the terms of the specific customer agreements and the specific customer’s warranty
experience. Because we have never been the cause of a vehicle recall nor suffered any product recalls or
liability damages, we have no warranty and recall data which allows us to establish accurate estimates of, or
provisions for, future warranty or recall costs relating to new products, assembly programs or technologies
being brought into production. In addition, we do not have insurance covering product recalls. The
obligation to repair or replace such products could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and
financial condition.

30


-----

A decrease in actual and perceived quality of our products could damage our image and reputation and
also the image and reputation of one or more of our brands. Defective products could result in loss of
sales, loss of customers and loss of market acceptance. In turn, any major defect in one of our products
could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and market perception, which in turn could
have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.

**_Our operations expose us to the risk of material health and safety liabilities._**

The nature of our operations subjects us to various statutory compliance and litigation risks under health,
safety and employment laws. We cannot guarantee that there will be no accidents or incidents suffered by
our employees, our contractors or other third parties on our sites. If any of these incidents occur, we could
be subject to prosecutions and litigation, which may lead to fines, penalties and other damages being
imposed on us and cause damage to our reputation. Such events could have a material adverse effect on
our business operations, financial position and operational results.

**_We are subject to environmental requirements and risks as a result of which we may incur significant costs,_**
**_liabilities and obligations._**

We are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws, regulations and permits that
govern, among other things, soil, surface water and groundwater contamination; the generation, storage,
handling, use, disposal and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of materials,
including greenhouse gases, or GHGs, into the environment; and health and safety. If we fail to comply
with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or become
subject to litigation. Environmental and pollution control laws, regulations and permits, and the
enforcement thereof, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may
necessitate substantial capital expenditures or operating costs.

We are also subject to environmental laws requiring investigation and clean-up of environmental
contamination and are in various stages of investigation and clean-up at one of our manufacturing facilities
where contamination has been alleged. Estimating environmental clean-up liabilities is complex and
heavily dependent on the nature and extent of historical information and physical data relating to the
contaminated sites, the complexity of the contamination, the uncertainty of which remedy to apply and the
outcome of discussions with regulatory authorities relating to the contamination. In addition, these
environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more
stringent and expensive over time. Therefore, we may not have been, and in the future may not be, in
complete compliance with all such laws and regulations and we may incur material costs or liabilities as a
result of such laws and regulations significantly in excess of amounts we have reserved. In addition to
potentially significant investigation and cleanup costs, contamination can give rise to third-party claims for
fines or penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury or property damage.

We cannot assure you that our costs, liabilities and obligations relating to environmental matters will not
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We may not be adequately insured._**

We currently have insurance arrangements in place for products and public liability, property damage,
business interruption (including for sudden and unexpected environmental damage). However, these
insurance policies may not cover any losses or damages resulting from the materialization of any of the
risks we are subject to. Further, significant increases in insurance premiums could reduce our cash flow. It
is also possible in the future that insurance providers may no longer wish to insure businesses in our
industry against certain environmental occurrences.

**_Significant changes in laws and governmental regulations could have an adverse effect on our profitability._**

The legal, regulatory and industry-standard environment in our principal markets is complex and dynamic,
and future changes to the laws, regulations and market practice as regards, for example, CO2 emissions and
safety tests and protocols, could have an adverse effect on the products we produce and our profitability.
Additionally, we could be adversely affected by changes in tax or other laws which impose additional costs
on automobile manufacturers or consumers, or more stringent fuel economy and emissions requirements
on manufacturers, of sport-utility vehicles, light trucks and other vehicles from which we derive some of
our sales.

31


-----

**_We may face risks relating to climate change that could have an adverse impact on our business._**

Greenhouse gas (‘‘GHG’’) emissions have increasingly become the subject of substantial international,
national, regional, state and local attention. GHG emission regulations have been promulgated in certain
of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and additional GHG requirements are in various stages of
development. For example, the United States Congress has considered legislation that would establish a
nationwide limit on GHGs. In addition, the EPA has issued regulations limiting GHG emissions from
mobile and stationary sources pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act. When effective, such measures could
require us to modify existing or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology,
curtail operations or increase our operating costs. In addition, our OEM customers may seek price
reductions from us to account for their increased costs resulting from GHG regulations. Further, growing
pressure to reduce GHG emissions from mobile sources could reduce automobile sales, thereby reducing
demand for our products and ultimately our revenues. Thus, any additional regulation of GHG emissions,
including through a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or
other program, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, reputation,
product demand and liquidity.

**_Natural disasters could disrupt our supply of products to our customers which could have a material adverse effect_**
**_on our operations and profitability._**

Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, including fires, floods,
hurricanes and earthquakes. The occurrence of any of these disasters could cause the total or partial
destruction of a manufacturing facility, thus preventing us from supplying products to our customers and
disrupting production at their facilities for an indeterminate period of time. The inability to promptly
resume the supply of products following a natural disaster at a manufacturing facility could have a material
adverse effect on our operations and profitability.

**_Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war or political changes in geographical areas where we operate may_**
**_affect our business and results of operations._**

Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may negatively affect our business and results of
operations. There can be no assurance that there will not be terrorist attacks or violent acts that may
directly impact us, our customers or partners. In addition, political changes in certain geographical areas
where we operate may affect our business and results of operations. Any of these occurrences could cause
a significant disruption in our business and could adversely affect our business operations, financial
position and operational results.

**Risks related to the notes**

**_The Collateral is limited to the pledge of shares in certain of the Guarantors and the notes are secured only to the_**
**_extent of the value of the Collateral; such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the notes and_**
**_the Guarantees._**

The holders of the notes are secured by the Collateral which consists only of a pledge of the shares in
certain of the Guarantors of the notes. The Collateral also secures, on a first ranking basis, the finance
parties under the Senior Facilities and the creditors under certain of our Existing Debt Facilities. Subject to
certain limits, the Indenture permits additional debt to be secured by the Collateral, and such additional
secured debt may be substantial. The rights of a holder of notes to the Collateral may be diluted by any
increase in the debt secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral securing the notes. If there is
an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) on the notes, there is no guarantee that the proceeds of
any sale of the Collateral will be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due under
the notes as well as other debt benefiting from a _pari passu security interest in the Collateral, including_
indebtedness under the Senior Facilities. The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the
security interests over the Collateral or in the event of liquidation will depend upon many factors,
including, among others, the availability of buyers. Furthermore, there may not be any buyer willing and
able to purchase our business or pledged subsidiaries, either individually or collectively. The book value of
the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets.

32


-----

**_The Parent Guarantor has control over the Collateral securing the notes, and the sale of particular assets could_**
**_reduce the pool of assets securing the notes._**

The Security Documents allow the Parent Guarantor to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control
over, and collect and invest any dividends and other distributions from the Collateral. So long as no default
or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Parent Guarantor may, subject to the
terms of the Indenture, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, dispose of the Collateral
(which shall remain subject to the pledges in respect thereto notwithstanding any such disposal).

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the notes._**

By its nature, the Collateral does not have a readily ascertainable market value and may not be saleable or,
if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
provide that decisions regarding enforcement are made by the holders of the notes and lenders holding,
collectively, a majority in aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. As a
result, holders of the notes may not solely control decisions in respect to the Collateral, including timing of
enforcement and such other secured parties may have interests that are not the same as those of holders of
the notes. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber
assets owned by the Guarantors whose shares form part of the Collateral, those parties have or may
exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other
rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, acting on
behalf of the Trustee or investors as holders of the notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the
proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes and the
Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have
only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or
any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the Intercreditor Agreement could reduce the proceeds
realized upon enforcement of the Collateral.

The Collateral securing the notes is subject to any and all encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
permitted under the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement. The existence of any such
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the
notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral.

**_The security interests in the Collateral are not directly granted to the holders of the notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that secure, amongst other obligations, the obligations of the Parent
Guarantor under the Guarantee are not granted directly to the holders of the notes but are granted only in
favor of the Security Agent on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the notes in accordance with the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents related to the Collateral. Holders of
the notes do not have direct security interests and are not entitled to take enforcement action in respect of
the Collateral securing the notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the
Collateral.

**_The granting of guarantees by Spanish companies is restricted by Spanish law._**

Spanish law imposes a restriction on the granting of guarantees by Spanish guarantors under Spanish
law-governed security documents such that guarantees in respect of obligations under such security
documents shall not include nor extend to any obligations or amounts that would render such guarantees
in contravention of sections 143.2, 149 or 150 of the Spanish Capital Companies Act (Real Decreto
_Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de Capital)._
In particular, no Spanish guarantee may secure any payment, prepayment, repayment or reimbursement
obligations derived from any finance document used, or that may be used, for the purposes of payment of
acquisition debt (for the purposes of Section 143.2, 149 or 150 of the Spanish Companies Act) or the
payment of any costs or transaction expenses related to, or paying the purchase price for, such acquisition.

**_The enforcement of the Collateral may be restricted by Spanish law._**

Spanish Insolvency Law imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured creditors’ rights (in rem
security) in the event of insolvency. Once the debtor is declared insolvent, the enforcement of security
interests over assets owned by the debtor and used for its professional or business activities (presumably
most of the debtor’s assets) is stayed until the first of the following circumstances occurs: (a) approval of a

33


-----

creditors’ composition agreement (unless the content has been approved by the favorable vote of the
secured creditors, in which case it will be bound by whatever has been agreed in the composition
agreement); or (b) one year has elapsed since the declaration of insolvency without liquidation proceedings
being initiated. Enforcement will be stayed even if at the time of declaration of insolvency the notices
announcing the public auction have been published. The stay will only be lifted when the court hearing the
insolvency proceedings determines that the asset is not used for the debtor’s professional or business
activities or is not necessary for the survival of the debtor’s business. When it comes to determining which
assets of the debtor are used for its professional or business activities, courts have generally embraced a
broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor’s assets. Finally, enforcement of the
Collateral will be subject to the provisions of Spanish Procedural Law and Spanish Insolvency Law (where
applicable) and this may entail delays in the enforcement.

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected (or
registered or other foreign equivalent) and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the
secured party. The liens on the Collateral securing the notes from time to time owned by us or the
Guarantors may not be perfected (or registered or other foreign equivalent), which may result in the loss
of the priority, or a defect in the perfection (or registration or other foreign equivalent), of the security
interest for the benefit of the Trustee and holders of the notes to which they would have been otherwise
entitled. Neither the Security Agent nor the Trustee will be obligated to create or perfect any of the
security interests in the Collateral.

Spanish law does not contemplate the concept of ‘‘security agent’’. Although this by itself does not prohibit
this agent to be set in place, the fact that there is a lack of regulation on the matter provides uncertainty as
to how a Spanish court would recognize the acting of the Security Agent in an enforcement situation. Since
holders of the notes will not have any independent power to enforce the Collateral securing the notes,
except through the Security Agent following the instructions of the Trustee, there is some uncertainty as to
whether a Spanish court would recognize the authority of the Security Agent or whether lack of
recognition would entail delays in the enforcement or even the consequence of the Collateral not being
able to be enforced on the same terms as provided for in the Security Documents.

For more information, please see ‘‘Enforceability of Civil Liabilities’’.

**_The Collateral may be released without the consent of the holders of the notes._**

The Collateral may be released in certain circumstances, including in the event the Collateral is sold
pursuant to an enforcement sale in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. Upon any such
enforcement sale in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, such Guarantor’s Guarantee may also
be released. Please see ‘‘Description of the Notes—Release of Note Guarantees’’ and ‘‘Description of the
Notes—Security—Release of Security Interests’’.

Additionally, the Indenture permits us to release and retake the security interest granted over the
Collateral in order to issue additional notes pursuant to the Indenture. Upon the issuance of additional
notes pursuant to the Indenture, there may be a time period imposed by applicable laws between the
release and retaking of the security interest during which there is no security interest over the Collateral.
In some circumstances, such as if we were to file for bankruptcy after the issuance of additional notes, a
hardening period may apply and retroactively void the retaking of the security interest in favor of the
holders of the notes. Accordingly, there is a risk that, should we issue additional notes pursuant to the
Indenture, the Collateral could be released and its subsequent retaking voided. Please see ‘‘Description of
the Notes—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’.

**_Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual currencies_**
**_within the Eurozone, or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could adversely affect the value of the notes._**

Despite the creation of the ESM and the Fiscal Compact, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of
certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the
euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political
circumstances in individual Member States. These and other concerns could lead to the re-introduction of
individual currencies in one or more Member States, including Spain, or, in more extreme circumstances,
the possible dissolution of the euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual
consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such
time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could
adversely affect the value of the notes.

**_Our substantial indebtedness may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the notes, and to operate our_**
**_business._**

We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2012, as adjusted to give pro forma
effect to this offering, the entering into of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Mitsui Investment and the
application of the estimated proceeds therefrom, we would have had A1,835.4 million of indebtedness, of
which A766.0 million would have been represented by the notes. We anticipate that our substantial
indebtedness will continue for the foreseeable future. Our substantial indebtedness may have important
negative consequences for you, including:

- making it more difficult for us and our subsidiaries to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt,
including the notes and other liabilities;

- requiring that a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations of our operating subsidiaries be
dedicated to debt service obligations, reducing the availability of cash flow to fund internal growth
through working capital and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes;

- increasing our vulnerability to economic downturns in our industry;

- exposing us to interest rate increases;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation
to cash flow;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry;

- restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities; and

- limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds or raise
equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

In the worst case, an actual or impending inability by us or our subsidiaries to pay debts as they become
due and payable could result in our insolvency.

In addition, the Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement contain restrictions that substantially limit
our financial and operational flexibility and that of our subsidiaries. In particular, these agreements place
limits on our ability to incur additional indebtedness; grant security interests to third persons; dispose of
material assets; undertake organizational measures such as mergers, changes of corporate form, joint
ventures or similar transactions; and enter into transactions with related parties.

**_Despite our current substantial indebtedness, we may be able to incur more debt in the future, including on a_**
**_secured basis over the Collateral or otherwise, which could further exacerbate the risks of our indebtedness._**

We may incur more debt in the future. The revolving portion of our Senior Facilities Agreement provides
for total commitments of up to A280.0 million, and no cash drawings were outstanding on the date the
notes were issued. The Indenture and the Senior Facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt but do
not prohibit us from doing so. We may incur additional debt in the future, secured by the Collateral or
otherwise, which could mature prior to the notes, and such debt could be secured on an equal, rateable and
_pari passu basis with the notes and the Guarantees. Any non-Guarantor subsidiary could also incur_
additional debt, and the notes and Guarantees would be structurally subordinated to any such debt.

**_The Issuer is dependent on payments from the Parent Guarantor to make payments on the notes and, in turn, the_**
**_Parent Guarantor is dependent on payments from its subsidiaries in order to be able to make payments to the Issuer,_**
**_and the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries may not be permitted or otherwise able to make payments to the Parent_**
**_Guarantor._**

Even if the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries generate sufficient cash from their operations, their ability to
provide funds to the Parent Guarantor and, therefore, the Parent Guarantor’s ability to provide funds to
the Issuer are subject to, among other things, local tax restrictions and local corporate law restrictions
related to earnings, the level of legal or statutory reserves, losses from previous years and capitalization
requirements for the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries. As a result, although the Parent Guarantor may have
sufficient resources, on a consolidated basis, to make the necessary payments to the Issuer in order for the
Issuer to meet its obligations, the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries may not be able to make the necessary
transfers to it, and it to the Issuer, to permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the notes or

35


-----

otherwise. In particular, the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries may be restricted from providing funds to it
under some circumstances. These circumstances include:

- restrictions under the corporate law of the jurisdictions in which the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries
are based. The relevant laws could require, among other things, that its subsidiaries retain a certain
percentage of annual net income in a legal reserve, that its subsidiaries maintain the share capital of a
limited liability company and that, after payment of any divided, the relevant subsidiary’s
shareholders’ equity exceed its share capital. For example, Spanish law limits certain of the Parent
Guarantor’s subsidiaries’ ability to provide funds to the Parent Guarantor due to restrictions that
require, among other things, each of its Spanish subsidiaries to retain at least 10% of their annual net
profit (beneficio neto) income in a legal reserve until the reserve reaches at least 20% of such
company’s share capital and that, after payment of any dividend, shareholders’ equity must exceed the
company’s share capital. In addition, in order for Spanish companies to distribute dividends
(i) available reserves must be equal to, or greater than, the R&D expenses appearing in the balance
sheet of the company; and (ii) a non-disposable reserve equal to the goodwill appearing in the balance
sheet of the company must be created. Moreover, the by-laws of each of the Parent Guarantor’s
Spanish subsidiaries may provide for additional reserves that must be retained prior to providing
funds to it;

- restrictions under foreign exchange laws and regulations that could limit or tax the remittance of
dividends or transfer payments abroad; and

- existing and future contractual restrictions, including restrictions in credit facilities, cash pooling
arrangements and other indebtedness that affect the ability of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries to
pay dividends or make other payments to it in the future.

**_The Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under its funding loans because its right to receive payments_**
**_under such funding loans is subordinated to all third party liabilities of the Parent Guarantor._**

Under Spanish insolvency law, the funding loans between the Issuer of the notes and the Parent Guarantor
will be classified as subordinated claims of the Parent Guarantor, meaning that in an insolvency proceeding
they would be subordinated to the preferential and ordinary claims of the Parent Guarantor.

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and for other general corporate purposes. Our ability to_**
**_generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make payments on our debt, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, will
depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some
extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which
are beyond our control, as well as the other factors discussed in these ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and elsewhere in
these listing particulars.

Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, and additional debt and equity
financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due,
including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity,
please see ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects’’.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations
as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, on or before maturity.

We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at
all. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Senior Facilities Agreement and the notes, and any
future debt that we may incur, may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

**_The Guarantees are significantly limited by applicable laws and are subject to certain limitations or defenses._**

The Guarantors will guarantee the payment of the notes as described in ‘‘Description of the Notes—The
Note Guarantees.’’ The Guarantees provide the holders of the notes with a direct claim against the
relevant Guarantor. However, the obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee are limited under
the Indenture to an amount that has been determined so as to ensure that amounts payable will not result
in violations of laws relating to corporate benefit, capitalization, capital preservation (under which, among
others, the risks associated with a guarantee or grant of security on account of a parent company’s debt
need to be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the Guarantor’s or grantor’s
perspective), thin capitalization, corporate purpose, financial assistance or transactions under value, or
otherwise cause the Guarantor to be deemed insolvent under applicable law or such Guarantee to be
deemed void, unenforceable or ultra vires, or cause the directors of such Guarantor to be held in breach of
applicable corporate or commercial law for providing such Guarantee. If these limitations are not
observed, the Guarantees and the grant of security interests by the Guarantors could be subject to legal
challenge.

As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantees could be materially reduced or eliminated
depending upon the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain
jurisdictions, a guarantee issued by a company that is not in that company’s corporate interests or the
burden of which exceeds the benefit to the company may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that a
Guarantor, a creditor of a Guarantor or the insolvency administrator, in the case of an insolvency of a
Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the respective Guarantee and that the applicable
court may determine that the Guarantee should be limited or voided. In the event that any Guarantee is
deemed invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent that agreed limitations on the
Guarantee apply, the notes would not be guaranteed by such Guarantee.

For more information on the specific limitations under applicable law of the respective jurisdictions of
incorporation of the Guarantors and certain contractual limitations to be confirmed in the Indenture,
please see ‘‘Enforceability of Civil Liabilities’’.

**_Fraudulent conveyance laws may limit your rights as a holder of notes._**

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance laws, a court
could subordinate or void a Guarantee if it found that:

- the Guarantee was incurred with an actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders
of the Guarantor;

- the Guarantee was granted within two years prior to the insolvency declaration of the Guarantor and
it is detrimental for the Guarantor’s state; or

- the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the Guarantee and
the Guarantor:

- was insolvent or was rendered insolvent because of the Guarantee;

- was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the Guarantee; or

- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay at maturity.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws varies depending on the law
applied. Generally, however, a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if it could not pay its debts as they
become due. If a court decided that any Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such
Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you would cease to have any claim in respect of
the Guarantor of such Guarantee and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and the remaining
Guarantors. Please see ‘‘Enforceability of Civil Liabilities’’.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the Guarantees, and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent
transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain
findings, to: (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee;
(ii) direct that holders of the notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor
or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and (iii) take other action that is detrimental to
you.

37

**_Local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of another jurisdiction with which you_**
**_may be more familiar._**

The Issuer is incorporated in Luxembourg, and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of other
jurisdictions, including Spain. See ‘‘Summary—The Offering—Guarantors’’. The insolvency laws of these
other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to holders of the notes as the laws of some other jurisdictions
with which you may be more familiar. Certain provisions of the insolvency laws in these jurisdictions could
affect the ranking of the notes and the Guarantees or claims relating to the notes and the Guarantees on
an insolvency of the Issuer or the Guarantors, as the case may be.

**_Not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the notes, and any claim by us or any of our creditors, including the_**
**_holders of the notes, against such non-Guarantor subsidiaries will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims_**
**_of creditors of those non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Not all of our existing and future subsidiaries have guaranteed the notes. On a consolidated basis as of
December 31, 2012, we had total assets of A4,691.1 million and total debt of A1,598.8 million. As of and for
the year ended December 31, 2012, the subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor guaranteeing the notes
(including Edscha Santander, S.L., Edscha Burgos, S.L., Gestamp Toledo, S.L. and Gestamp Levante, S.L.)
represent approximately 49.0% and 51.8% of our total consolidated assets and EBITDA, respectively. In
addition, after giving pro forma effect to the offering, the entering into of the Senior Facilities Agreement,
the Mitsui Investment and the application of the proceeds therefrom, the subsidiaries of the Parent
Guarantor that have not guaranteed the notes would have had A232.2 million of debt outstanding as of
December 31, 2012 on a consolidated basis. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness’’. The Indenture does
not limit the transfer of assets to, or the making of investments in, any of our restricted group members,
including our non-guarantor subsidiaries. Please see ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.’’
Accordingly, even though certain of our material subsidiaries are required to provide an additional
Guarantee for the benefit of the notes pursuant to the Indenture, non-Guarantor subsidiaries could
account for a higher portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues and net income in the future. See
‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees’’.

In the event that any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates, reorganizes,
dissolves or otherwise winds up, the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary will not be subject to claims
from the holders of the notes to satisfy their respective credits against us and will be used first to satisfy the
claims of the non Guarantor subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors, banks and other lenders.
Consequently, any claim by us or our creditors against a non-Guarantor subsidiary will be structurally
subordinated to all of the claims of the creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer._**

Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events as described in the Indenture, the Issuer will be
required to offer to repurchase all of the notes in cash in an amount equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The requirement that the
Issuer offer to repurchase the notes upon a change of control is limited only to the transactions specified in
the definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ within the Indenture. Please see ‘‘Description of the Notes—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.’’ The Issuer may not have sufficient funds at
the time of any such event to make the required repurchases. Additionally, certain change of control events
would be prepayment events under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In the event this results in an event of
default thereunder, the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement may accelerate such debt, which
could also cause an event of default under the Indenture.

The source of funds for any repurchase required as a result of any such event will be available cash or cash
generated from operating activities or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets and sales of
equity or funds provided by subsidiaries. Sufficient funds may not be available at the time of any such
events to make any required repurchases of the notes tendered.

**_You may be unable to enforce judgments against us, the Guarantors or our respective directors and officers._**

Neither the Issuer nor any of the Guarantors are incorporated in the United States. In addition, most of
our assets are outside the United States and all of the Group’s directors and officers live outside the
United States, primarily in Spain. The Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ auditors are also organized outside the
United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible to serve process against any of these persons in
the United States. Furthermore, because all or substantially all of the assets of these persons are located

38


-----

outside of the United States, it may not be possible to enforce judgments obtained in courts in the United
States predicated upon civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States against
these persons. Additionally, there is doubt as to the enforceability in many foreign jurisdictions, including
Spain, of civil liabilities based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the
United States against the Issuer, the Guarantors, the directors, controlling persons and management and
any experts named in these listing particulars who are not residents of the United States. Please see
‘‘Enforceability of Civil Liabilities.’’

**_The interests of our ultimate controlling shareholders may be inconsistent with the interest of holders of the notes_**
**_and/or our ultimate controlling shareholders may sell their stake in future._**

Our ultimate controlling shareholders are members of the Riberas family, of which the legal representative
of our joint and several Managing Director (‘‘Consejero Delegado solidario’’), Gestamp Bizkaia, S.A., is a
member. See ‘‘Shareholders and Certain Transactions’’. As a result, our ultimate controlling shareholders
have and will continue to have direct or indirect power, among other things, to influence our legal and
capital structure and our day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change our management
and to approve other changes to our operations. The interests of our ultimate controlling shareholders
could conflict with your interests, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our
debts when due. In addition, our controlling parties may, in the future, own businesses that directly
compete with ours in certain respects or do business with us.

In addition, our controlling shareholders may suffer financial distress and may need to sell their stake in
the Issuer. In order to avoid negative distortions to and minimize the volatility of our share price derived
from any such sales, we may decide from time to time to acquire such shares for our treasury stock, which
would result in a substantial cost for us and may affect our results of operations.

**_There is no existing public trading market for the notes and the ability to transfer them is limited, which may_**
**_adversely affect the value of the notes._**

The notes were a new issue. There is no existing trading market for the notes and there can be no
assurance that a trading market for the notes will develop. We cannot predict the extent to which investor
interest in our company will lead to the development of an active trading market or how liquid that trading
market might become. Although the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market
in the notes, they are not obligated to do so and may stop at any time. The market price of our notes may
be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:

- changes in demand, the supply or pricing of our products;

- general economic conditions, including raw material prices;

- the activities of competitors;

- our quarterly or annual earnings or those of our competitors;

- investors’ perceptions of us and the automotive industry;

- the failure of securities analysts to cover our notes after this offering or changes in financial estimates
by analysts;

- the public’s reaction to our press releases or our other public announcements;

- future sales of notes; and

- other factors described under these ‘‘Risk Factors’’.

As a result of these factors, you may not be able to resell your notes at or above the initial offering price. In
addition, securities trading markets experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been
unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market
fluctuations and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our notes, regardless of our
operating performance. If an active trading market does not develop, you may have difficulty selling any
notes that you buy.

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. securities laws and
we have not undertaken to effect any exchange offer for the notes in the future. You may not offer the
notes for sale in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to,
the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an

39


-----

effective registration statement. The notes and the Indenture contain provisions that restrict the notes
from being offered, sold or otherwise transferred except pursuant to the exemptions available pursuant to
Rule 144A and Regulation S, or other exceptions under the Securities Act. Furthermore, we have not
registered the notes under any other country’s securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your
offers and sales of the notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities
laws. Please see ‘‘Notice to Investors’’. In addition, by its acceptance of delivery of any notes, the holder
thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor accounts for which it has purchased the
notes that it shall not transfer the notes in an amount less than A100,000 and integral multiples of A1,000
thereafter (in the case of the Euro notes) and in an amount less than $200,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000 thereafter (in the case of the Dollar notes).

(2) Consists of deferred tax assets, current financial assets and other current assets.

(3) ‘‘EBITDA’’ represents operating profit before depreciation, amortization and impairment losses. Our management believes that
EBITDA is meaningful for investors because it provides an analysis of our operating results, profitability and ability to service
debt and because EBITDA is used by our chief operating decision makers to track our business evolution, establish operational
and strategic targets and make important business decisions. EBITDA is also a measure commonly reported and widely used by
analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry. To facilitate the analysis of our operations, this indicator excludes
amortization, impairment and depreciation expenses from operating profit in order to eliminate the impact of general
long-term capital investment. Although we are presenting this measure to enhance the understanding of our historical operating
performance, EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to operating profit as an indicator of our operating
performance, or an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The following table presents
the calculation of this measure:

**Overview**

We are a leading global automotive supplier active in the design, development and manufacture of metal
components and assemblies for sale to OEMs, primarily for use in the production of light vehicles. We
have an extensive global footprint of 94 production facilities in 19 countries over four continents with four
additional plants under construction as of December 31, 2012. We supply our products globally to all of the
12 largest OEMs by production volume. Our extensive geographical and customer diversification allows us
to take advantage of global growth opportunities and has mitigated the impact of regional production
fluctuations on our business during economic downturns.

We offer our OEM customers a diverse product portfolio, supplying Body-in-White and Chassis structures
and complex assemblies, Mechanisms, as well as tooling and dies and other related services. We are one of
the very few truly global suppliers to OEMs in our product portfolios, which sets us apart from many of our
competitors in the industry. We have long-standing and entrenched relationships with our largest OEM
customers and, as a result, have been able to proactively manage our business to meet the developing
global trends in the industry and the resulting changes in the requirements of the OEMs that we supply.

**Key factors affecting our results of operations**

We believe that the following factors impact our results of operations:

- **_Significant acquisitions_**

Certain significant, discretionary acquisitions listed below have had a material effect on our financial
results, have affected our consolidation perimeter and represented a large portion of our investments
in the past few years. Our investments and add-on acquisitions have significantly contributed to our
increase in EBITDA from A390.0 million in 2010 to A620.1 million in 2012 and to the increase in our
cash flows from operating activities from A271.2 million in 2010 to A371.5 million in 2012. There were
no disposals which had a significant effect on our financial results in the years ended December 31,
2012, 2011 and 2010. The following is a summary of the acquisitions that have had a significant effect
on our financial results in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

_2012_

There were no acquisitions which had a significant effect on our financial results in the year ended
December 31, 2012.

_2011_

_ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming business acquisition._

On April 28, 2011 our subsidiary Metalbages, S.A. signed a sale and purchase agreement with
ThyssenKrupp for the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of certain companies of the metal
forming business unit of the ThyssenKrupp group, or ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming. After having
received the required approvals, as of July 20, 2011, we consummated the aforementioned acquisition
through a newly incorporated subsidiary, GMF Holding GmbH (‘‘GMF Holding’’). ThyssenKrupp
Metal Forming is domiciled in several European countries (Germany, France and the United
Kingdom). In acquiring these companies we assumed the contracts with clients and suppliers, the staff
and the shareholdings in companies located in Spain, the United Kingdom, Poland and Turkey. These

46


-----

newly acquired companies were incorporated into our consolidation scope as of July 31, 2011.
Subsequently, on December 2, 2011, after receiving the relevant regulatory approvals, GMF Holding
acquired one additional company, based in China, which had also belonged to ThyssenKrupp Metal
Forming. As a result of the acquisition of ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming, we acquired 18 production
facilities and two R&D centers.

The acquired business is one of the main producers of chassis components. The transaction improved
our market position worldwide in chassis structures, enhanced the diversification of our customer base
and brought improvements to our technology base, as well as increased economies of scale. The
headcount of this newly incorporated business unit amounted to approximately 4,430 at the time of
the acquisition.

The cost of the acquisition amounted to A383.8 million, of which A195.3 million corresponded to the
purchase of the companies’ shares and A188.6 million to the assumption of debts. The acquired
company had A45.0 million of cash on its balance sheet. Of the total consideration, A358.8 million was
paid in cash by GMF Holding and Gestamp Auto Component (Kunshan), Co., Ltd. In addition,
A25.0 million was deferred until the year 2012. There were no outstanding payments as at
December 31, 2012.

No goodwill arose from the acquisition and there are no significant contingent payments. The net
effect of the business combination has been registered under the heading ‘‘Other operating income’’
in our consolidated income statement as of December 31, 2011. The revenue and net result of the
acquired businesses reflected in our consolidated financial statements from the date of incorporation
into the consolidation scope to December 31, 2011 amounted to A518.7 million and A3.2 million in
losses, respectively, including the net effect on income of the business combination amounting to
A2.6 million.

On December 6, 2011, we sold a 49.06% non-controlling interest in this business unit to Tocqueville
Capital Company B.V. (‘‘Tocqueville’’) (which is a subsidiary of the Liberty Hampshire Company, LLC
or ‘‘Liberty’’). Under our agreement with Liberty, we have an option to purchase the shares in
GMF Holding held by Tocqueville, for a fixed purchase price of A104.0 million on or prior to
September 30, 2013 (the ‘‘Liberty Option’’), failing which Liberty may sell its shares to a third party.
Upon any such sale, if the sale price realized by Liberty is lower than A104.0 million, then we will be
obligated to pay Liberty an amount such that Liberty would receive an aggregate amount of
A104.0 million for its shares. Under the terms of the back-up facility agreement dated December 1,
2011 between Gestamp Metalbages, S.A. and Soci´et´e G´en´erale, S.A. (‘‘Soci´et´e G´en´erale’’) and the
corresponding deed of guarantee dated December 1, 2011 between Gestamp Automoci´on and Soci´et´e
G´en´erale for a maximum amount of A104.0 million (the ‘‘Soci´et´e G´en´erale Guaranteed Back-up
Facility Agreement’’), in the event that Tocquevile receives an amount of less than A104.0 million in
the sale of its shares in GMF Holding to a third party, Soci´et´e G´en´erale has agreed to make available
to Gestamp Metalbages, S.A. a term loan facility up to A104.0 million that allows Tocquevile to receive
an aggregate of A104.0 million. The Soci´et´e G´en´erale Guaranteed Back-up facility Agreement
terminates on September 5, 2013.

_ALHC, LLC and Gestamp South Carolina, LLC_

On October 1, 2009 Gestamp North America, Inc. acquired a 40% stake in ALHC, LLC, which in
2009 and 2010 was reflected in our consolidated financial statements using the equity method. As a
result of this acquisition, we acquired one manufacturing facility. On April 29, 2011 Gestamp North
America, Inc. acquired the remaining 60% shareholding of ALHC, LLC, which owns 100% of
Gestamp South Carolina, a company domiciled in South Carolina (US) whose corporate purpose is
metal stamping and the manufacture of metal components. As such, as of that date, we acquired full
ownership of both companies.. The headcount of this newly incorporated business amounted to
approximately 190. The net effect of the business combination amounted to A1.8 million and has been
registered under the heading ‘‘Other operating expenses’’ in our consolidated income statement as of
December 31, 2011. Additionally, when we obtained control, there was a net debt at ALHC, LLC with
the acquiring company Gestamp North America, Inc., in the amount of A30.0 million, included in the
previous balance sheet, mainly, under the heading ‘‘other non-current liabilities’’. The revenue and
net income of the acquired business reflected in the consolidated financial statements from the date of
incorporation into the consolidation scope to December 31, 2011 amounted to A148.3 million and

47


-----

A8.3 million in profit, respectively, including the net effect on income of the business combination
amounting to A1.8 million of profit.

_2010_

_Edscha acquisition_

On April 1, 2010, after having received the required approvals, we consummated the purchase of
100% of the body mechanisms business unit of Edscha, whereby we acquired the material assets
including receivables and inventories held by companies in EU countries (Germany, Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Spain, France and Portugal), assumed existing contracts with clients and suppliers,
incorporated the existing staff, as well as investments in companies located in Brazil, China, Taiwan
and Japan. This transaction enhanced our technological positioning vis-`a-vis our clients and added an
entirely new product category to our existing portfolio, a category in which the acquired business unit
is the market leader worldwide. The transaction was executed in the context of the liquidation process
carried out by the official receiver of the sellers, which reside in the European Union. The bankruptcy
proceedings began in February 2009. The cost of the acquisition amounted to A129.9 million and was
paid entirely using surplus cash on hand. The headcount that was incorporated from this business
amounted to 3,858. There are no significant contingent payments arising out of the acquisition. The
negative goodwill associated with the acquisition of Edscha in 2010 amounted to A47.3 million, which
was netted off with a provision for risks relating to our trading relationships with customers amounting
to A34.6 million. As a result of this acquisition, we acquired 12 production facilities and three R&D
centers.

The impact in the consolidated net turnover and the consolidated net income attributable to the
business combination from the acquisition date to December 31, 2010 amounted to A470.9 million and
A32.0 million of profit, respectively. The effect of the business combination, if it had been carried out
from January 1, 2010, would have amounted to A630.0 million in net turnover and A46.0 million in net
income as of December 31, 2010.

- **_Capital expenditure_**

The growth of our business involves significant capital expenditure, to the extent that we build new
manufacturing plants or increase capacity in existing plants. Increased success and penetration with
our customers based on increased project awards translates into increased capital expenditure to
accommodate the execution of those projects. Once a project is ongoing, maintenance capital
expenditure is limited and somewhat predictable. When new programs or vehicle models are required,
usually at the end of a vehicle cycle, ‘‘renewal’’ or ‘‘replacement’’ capital expenditure is required in
order to adapt existing infrastructure to accommodate new assembly and process design, usually at
levels significantly below the expenditure required to create the capacity in the first place.

For instance, we initiated the construction of eight new manufacturing facilities during the period
from November 1, 2010 to December 31, 2012. The construction period for these new manufacturing
facilities typically ranges between 12 months and 15 months and the cash used in investments in
property, plant and equipment associated with the construction and equipment of these new
manufacturing facilities typically ranges between A40 million and A70 million. Once the construction of
a manufacturing facility is completed, the output of the manufacturing facility increases over time,
reaching full production capacity typically during the following 18 to 24 months. The table below sets
out eight such new manufacturing facilities, the aggregate cash used in or expected to be used in

- **_Global automotive market_**

The cycles of the global automotive industry, which is correlated with general global macroeconomic
conditions, impacts our OEM customers’ production requirements and consequently impacts the
volume of purchases of our products by our OEM customers. With increased economic growth in our
growth markets and recovery in our more traditional markets, we have experienced and expect to
experience increased vehicle production levels, with a consequent increase in the demand for our
products and a positive impact on our revenues with slower economic growth having the correlative
effect.

- **_Diversification_**

Our strong geographic, customer and product diversification has had the effect of reducing revenue
volatility during the economic downturn. Our well-diversified customer base, which includes all of the
12 largest OEMs by production volume, has limited our exposure to a downturn in the demand for any
one OEM’s products portfolio. Regional differences in duration, timing and intensity of economic
cycles, combined with the diversity of our geographic footprint, have mitigated the effects of the
economic cycle on our business, limiting the impact of our exposure to the cycle in any one region or
geography. Our stable revenues have allowed us to take advantage of global growth opportunities,
even during the economic downturn.

- **_Steel price_**

A significant part of our cost base consists of purchases of raw materials which are variable in nature.
The primary raw material used in our business is steel, which in recent years has represented
approximately 50% of our sales. While steel prices affect our revenue and costs, historically, our profit
margins have not been significantly affected by changes in steel prices. In 2012, over 60% of our steel
was purchased through OEM re-sale programs, under which an OEM customer negotiates directly

49


-----

with the steel suppliers the price of the steel that we use to manufacture components for that OEM.
Such negotiated steel price is passed through to the OEM customer in the sale price of the automotive
component. The remainder of our steel purchasing requirements in 2012 was met through contracts
with steel suppliers that we negotiated. Historically, we have negotiated with our OEM customers to
pass through the increase or decrease in the steel price, eliminating significant volatility in our margins
relating to volatility in steel prices. Due to our strong relationships with OEMs and the large steel
volumes we acquire in the market place, we expect to be able to negotiate competitive steel contracts
from suppliers and to pass through cost increases to our customers, thus stabilizing the effect on our
margins.

We also sell scrap steel, which is a byproduct of our production process. Typically, the price of scrap
steel fluctuates in line with steel prices. We generally share our recoveries from sales of scrap steel
with our OEM customers either through scrap sharing agreements, in cases where we are on resale
programs, or in the product pricing that we negotiate with OEMs based on increases and decreases in
the steel price in cases where we purchase steel directly from the mills. As with steel prices, we may be
impacted by the fluctuation in scrap steel prices, either positive or negative, but historically these
fluctuations have had a limited impact on our margins.

- **_Other costs_**

Labor costs have represented in recent years between approximately 15% and 17% of our total annual
sales. A significant part of our labor costs are semi-variable in nature and can be adjusted to meet
business needs. For example, in 2008 and 2009, we were able to respond quickly to the deterioration in
market conditions and took measures to contain costs by lowering headcount, including a reduction in
the number of temporary personnel. The predictability of our cost-base has assisted our strategic
planning and has allowed us to maintain consistent profit margins.

- **_Vehicle cycles_**

In our industry, once a project has been nominated to a preferred supplier, it is rare for an OEM to
switch to another supplier, given the prohibitive operational, technical and logistical costs of switching,
particularly during the life cycle of a specific vehicle model. Vehicle models typically have long,
multi-year product life cycles. Given these factors, while the actual revenues which we derive from a
project ultimately depend on our OEM customers’ production volumes achieved for the respective car
models, we have good visibility on mid-term revenues within a relatively small range of sensitivity.

- **_Product pricing_**

During the life cycle of a contract, we are expected to achieve production efficiencies. Typically, in line
with our industry practice, we pass on a portion of these production efficiencies to our customers by
way of price reductions during the term of the contract. When negotiated price reductions are
expected to be retroactive, we accrue for such amounts as a reduction of revenues as products are
shipped. To the extent we are not able to achieve the efficiencies necessary to offset the price
reductions, such price reductions negatively impact our revenues.

- **_Seasonality_**

Our business is seasonal. Our working capital requirements typically increase during the first and
second quarters of the year and reduce towards the end of the year. This is due to the following
factors. OEMs typically slow down vehicle production during certain portions of the year. For
instance, our customers in Europe typically slow down vehicle production during the beginning of the
second half of the year in July or August as well as towards the end of the year during the holiday
season in December during which they also often conduct internal maintenance and adjustments to
inventory. Further, there are a fewer number of working days at the end of a year as opposed to the
beginning of a year and this results in a reduction in vehicle production at the end of the year. Also,
we typically agree final due amounts with our suppliers at the end of the year, which are usually paid
at the beginning of the following year, resulting in higher payables at the end of the year and
significant cash outflows during January and February. Further, a significant portion of our tooling
receivables balances are collected from our clients typically before year-end, resulting in a reduction in
receivables and cash inflows at the end of the year. Our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity
may therefore be impacted by these seasonal practices. However, our strong geographic, customer and
product diversification allows us to take advantage of global production cycles and has mitigated the
impact of regional demand fluctuations during the year on our business.

- **_Transaction and foreign exchange translation_**

We seek to limit our foreign exchange transaction risk by purchasing and manufacturing products in
the same country where we sell to our final customer. However, the translation of foreign currencies
back to the Euro may have a significant impact on our revenues and financial results. Foreign
exchange has an unfavorable impact on revenues when the Euro is relatively strong as compared with
foreign currencies and a favorable impact on revenues when the Euro is relatively weak as compared
with foreign currencies. The functional currency of our foreign operations is the local currency. Assets
and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into Euro using the applicable period-end rates
of exchange. Results of operations are translated at applicable average rates prevailing throughout the
period. Translation gains or losses are reported as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity (deficit). Gains and
losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, the amounts of which were not material in any of
the periods presented in these listing particulars, are included in net income (loss).

**Principal profit and loss account items**

The following is a brief description of the revenue and expenses that are included in the line items of our
consolidated profit and loss accounts.

**_Operating Income_**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue is recognized when products are delivered or services are provided, regardless of when actual
payment or collection occurs. Revenue is recognized at fair value of the balancing entry, defining fair value
as the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing
parties in an arm’s length transaction, taking into account the amount of any discounts or rebates provided.
Revenue includes:

- Sale of goods: Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the following conditions have been
met:

  - We have transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods;

  - We retain neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with
ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;

  - The amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

  - It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to us; and

  - The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be reliably measured.

- Manufacture of tools for third party sale and rendering of services: Revenue arising from the
manufacture of tools for sale to third parties and the rendering of services is recognized by reference
to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. This is referred to as the stage of
completion method. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 included elsewhere in these listing particulars.

- Interest, royalties, and dividends: interest revenue is recognized as interest accrues taking into account
the effective return of the asset (using the effective interest method, i.e., the rate that makes
discounted future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument equal to the
initial carrying amount of the asset). Royalties are recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with
the substance of the relevant agreement. Dividends are recognized when the shareholder’s right to
receive payment is established.

**_Other operating income_**

Other operating income is comprised principally of grants related to income and grants related to assets
released to income for the year, surplus provision for taxes, surplus provision for other commitments,
surplus provision for environmental matters, own work capitalized and net effect of certain business
combinations and acquisitions during the year.

**_Operating Expenses_**

Our operating expenses are comprised primarily of expenses on raw materials and other consumables,
personnel expenses and depreciation, amortization and impairment losses. Expenses are recognized when
products are delivered or services are provided, regardless of when actual payment or collection occurs.
Further, expenses are recognized when there is a decrease in an asset or an increase in a liability that can
be measured reliably, and they are recognized during the period in which they are incurred.

**_Raw materials and other consumables_**

Our expenses on raw materials and other consumables include purchases of goods and tools for resale,
discounts for prompt payment, purchase returns and similar transactions, volume discounts, changes to
inventories, purchases of raw materials, consumption of other supplies, expenses on work performed by
third parties, impairment and reversal of impairment of goods for resale and raw materials.

**_Personnel expenses_**

Our personnel expenses include salaries, social security and other benefits expenses. Personnel expenses
are primarily costs driven by the size of our operations, our geographical reach and customer
requirements.

**_Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses_**

Depreciation and amortization relates to the depreciation of our property, plant and equipment. Annual
depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the standard estimated useful lives of the
various assets. The physical life of our forming assets is typically longer. Our maintenance and
replacement/renewal capital expenditures for our equipment is less than the depreciation of our assets.
Land is not depreciated and is presented net of any impairment charges.

Property, plant, and equipment is carried at either acquisition or production cost, including all the costs
and expenses directly related with assets acquired until ready for use, less accumulated depreciation and
any impairment losses.

Certain major parts of some items of plant and equipment may require replacement at irregular intervals.
The cost of these parts is capitalized when the part is replaced and depreciated over their estimated useful
lives. The net carrying amount of replaced parts is retired with a charge to income when the replacement
occurs. Ordinary repair or maintenance work is not capitalized.

An item of property, plant, and equipment is retired upon disposal or when no future economic benefits
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on retirement of the asset (calculated as the
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the net carrying amount of the asset) is included in the
income statement in the year the asset is retired. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or
development of a qualifying asset (which is an asset that takes more than one year to be ready for its
intended use) are capitalized as part of the cost of the respective assets.

**_Other operating expenses_**

Our other operating expenses relate to maintenance and upkeep, other external services, taxes and levies,
impairment of accounts receivable, profits or losses from disposal of assets, application of non-current
provisions and profits from business combinations.

**_Financial income (expenses)_**

Financial income primarily consists of income from equity investments and loans within our group and to
third parties.

Financial expenses are composed of interest expenses from our borrowings from companies within our
group and our external financings including bank borrowings and trade bills and other financial expenses.

**_Exchange gains (losses)_**

Exchange gains (losses) relates to the impact of changes in the functional currency relative to the euro on
foreign currency borrowings considered permanent. These exchange gains (losses) are taken directly to
equity under ‘‘Translation differences’’, net of the tax effect.

52


-----

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to euros at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the
transaction. Exchange gains and losses arising on the settlement of these transactions or on translating
foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at closing rates are recognized in the
consolidated income statement.

**_Share of profits (losses) from associates carried under the Equity Method_**

Share of profits (losses) in companies carried under the equity method is composed of the results of
companies included in our consolidated results, on which we have significant influence but not control or
joint control. For the purposes of the preparation of our financial statements, significant influence is
deemed to exist in investments in which we, directly or indirectly, hold over 20% of the voting power, and
in certain instances where our holding is less than 20%, but significant influence can be clearly
demonstrated. Companies in which our direct or indirect holding is between 20% and 50%, but in which
we do not hold the majority of voting rights or in which we do not have effective control or joint control
with another third party entity, are consolidated using the equity method.

**_Income tax_**

We file income tax returns in each of the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries are located. Our tax
expense (tax income) was calculated based on accounting profit, which is calculated based on a number of
factors such as theoretical tax expense, difference in prevailing rates, permanent differences, application of
tax credits carried forward, tax credits restructured by prescription, adjustments related to current tax
(previous years) and other tax adjustments.

Our theoretical tax rate applied in 2012 and 2011 was 30%. The ‘‘differences in prevailing rates’’ in 2012
and 2011 reflects the differences between prevailing rates in certain operating markets and the theoretical
applicable rate, mainly relating to operations taxed in the US, Brazil (34%), and Argentina (35%).

The permanent differences in 2011 and 2010 reflect mainly accelerated depreciation, inflation adjustments,
nondeductible provisions, fiscal transparency, nondeductible differences in exchange rates, nondeductible
expenses, and those differences generated in the consolidation process. Also, in 2012 ‘‘Other tax
adjustments’’ includes adjustments to capitalized tax credits related to differences in tax rates.

**_Profit (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest_**

Our consolidated results include entities in which we have a non-controlling interest. See note 17 to our
consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 included
elsewhere in these listing particulars for a description of the entities in which we had a non-controlling
interest during the period.

**Non-GAAP measures**

**_EBITDA_**

We define EBITDA as operating profit before depreciation and amortization and impairment losses. See
‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Data—Financial information and operational data’’.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue increased by A982.7 million, or 20.6%, to A5,757.3 million in 2012 from A4,774.6 million in 2011.
The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to (A) a A812.4 million or 17.0% increase in revenue in
2012 due to the fact that we consolidated the results of our acquired business, ThyssenKrupp Metal
Forming for a twelve-month period in 2012 compared to only a five month period in 2011; (B) a
A350.1 million or 7.3% increasing in revenue in 2012 due to organic growth comprised of a A281.7 million
or 5.9% increase in revenue in 2012 due to new contracts in the US, Russia and Brazil; and (C) a
A68.4 million or 1.4% increase in revenue in 2012 associated with additional sales under existing contracts,
partially offset by a A179.8 million or 3.8% reduction in revenue associated with lower sales in Western
Europe and a reduction in prices due to lower average steel prices.

The following table sets forth, by product category, our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011
and 2012:

_Body-in-White and Chassis._ Revenue increased by A969.7 million, or 25.7%, to A4,748.3 million in 2012
from A3,778.6 million in 2011. This increase was primarily due to a A812.4 million increase in revenue in

54


-----

2012 due to the full year effect in 2012 of the acquisition of ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming in 2011 and a
net increase in revenue in 2012 due to new contracts in the US, Russia and Brazil and additional orders
under existing contracts partially offset by lower sales in Western Europe.

_Mechanisms._ Revenue decreased by A8.4 million, or 1.2%, to A682.3 million in 2012 from A690.7 million
in 2011. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of units sold, in particular in Spain
and France, partially offset by an increase in the sale price of the units.

_Tooling and Other._ Revenue increased by A31.4 million, or 10.6%, to A326.7 million in 2012 from
A295.3 million in 2011. This increase was primarily due to the completion of some greenfield projects and
the sale of tooling kits for our new production lines in the US, Mexico, Russia and Brazil.

**_Operating expenses_**

_Raw materials and other consumables._ Raw materials and other consumables increased by A470.0 million,
or 14.8%, to A3,635.3 million in 2012 from A3,165.3 million in 2011. This increase was primarily due to the
full year effect in 2012 of the acquisition of ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming in 2011 and an increase in
consumption of raw materials and other consumables in 2012 due to new contracts in the US, Russia and
Brazil and additional orders under existing contracts. The lower percentage increase in raw materials and
other consumables expenses in 2012 in contrast to the revenue increase in 2012 is primarily due to lower
steel prices and growth in sales of chassis products, which utilize less raw materials.

_Personnel Expenses._ Personnel expenses increased by A255.7 million, or 34.8%, to A989.6 million in 2012
from A733.9 million in 2011. This increase was primarily due to a A160.1 million increase in personnel
expenses in 2012 due to the full year effect in 2012 of the acquisition of ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming in
2011, a A95.6 million increase in personnel expenses in 2012 due to an increase in full time employees due
to the ramp up phase of our new factories in the Czech Republic, Brazil, the US and Russia and the
increase in the average salary of our employees.

_Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses._ Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses
increased by A39.4 million, or 16.4%, to A280.0 million in 2012 from A240.6 million in 2011. This increase
was primarily due to a A28.1 million increase in depreciation due to the full year effect in 2012 of the
acquisition of ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming in 2011 and higher depreciation resulting from the increased
asset base compared to the prior year.

_Other Operating Expenses._ Other operating expenses increased by A160.0 million, or 34.2%, to
A627.2 million in 2012 from A467.3 million in 2011. This increase was primarily due to a A115.8 million
increase in other operating expenses due to the full year effect in 2012 of the acquisition of ThyssenKrupp
Metal Forming in 2011 and an increase in other operating expenses associated with startup costs of
projects in the US, Russia and Brazil completed in 2012 and higher other operating expenses due to the
increase in sales in 2012 and inflation.

**_Operating profit or loss_**

Operating profit increased by A33.3 million, or 10.9%, to A340.1 million in 2012 from A306.8 million in
2011. This increase was primarily due to the full year effect in 2012 of the acquisition of ThyssenKrupp
Metal Forming in 2011. Operating margin, operating profit over revenue, has decreased from 6.4% in 2011
to 5.9% in 2012 due to the fact that operating margins in ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming are lower than the
operating margins in the rest of our group since ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming is a newly acquired business
that we are still in the process of integrating it with the rest of our business.

**_EBITDA_**

EBITDA increased by A72.7 million, or 13.3%, to A620.1 million in 2012 from A547.4 million in 2011
primarily due to a greater increase in revenue than in our operating expenses.

**_Net financial income (expenses)_**

Net financial expense increased by A17.7 million, or 28.3%, to A80.2 million in 2012 from A62.5 million in
2011. This increase was primarily due to a weighted average increase in financial debt of A213.2 million for
the year, or 21.8%, and, to a lesser extent, due to an increase of approximately 30 basis points in the
average interest rate applicable to our indebtedness.

55


-----

**_Income Tax_**

Income tax expense increased by A19.0 million, or 33.1%, to A76.4 million in 2012 from A57.4 million in
2011, which has resulted in an increase in the average tax rate from 25.0% in 2011 to 29.1% in 2012. This
increase in the income tax was primarily due to an increase in taxable income in 2012 generated in
jurisdictions with higher tax rates like the US, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Germany, and amendments
in tax regulations in Spain that have resulted in a reduction in tax deductions being available to us.

**_Profit attributable to non-controlling interest_**

Profit attributable to non-controlling interest increased by A11.9 million to A16.0 million in 2012 from
A4.1 million in 2011. This increase in profit attributable to our non-controlling interest is attributable to the
higher profits achieved by our subsidiaries in which third parties hold a minority interest, such as our joint
ventures in China and Russia and our tooling companies and the full year effect in 2012 of the acquisition
of Thyssen Krupp Metal Forming in 2011.

The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to: (A) a A939.9 million or 29.6% increase in revenue in
2011 comprised of; (i) a A272.9 million or 8.6% increase in revenue in 2011 due to the fact that we
consolidated the results of our acquired business, Edscha for a twelve-month period in 2011, (ii) a
A518.7 million or 16.4% increase in revenue in 2011 due to the fact that we consolidated the results of our
acquired business, ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming for a five month period in 2011, and (iii) a A148.3 million
or 4.7% increase in revenue in 2011 due to the fact that we consolidated the results of our acquired
business, Gestamp South Carolina LLC for a twelve-month period in 2011 and (B) a A664.3 million or
21.0% increase in revenue in 2012 due to organic growth comprising of: (i) A462.1 million or 14.6%
increase in revenue in 2011 due to new contracts in the US, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, China,

India, Poland, the UK and Spain, and (ii) a A202.2 million or 6.4% increase in revenue associated with
additional sales under existing contracts.

The following table sets forth, by product category, our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011
and 2010:

_Body-in-White and Chassis._ Revenue increased by A1,157.1 million, or 44.0%, to A3,788.6 million in 2011
from A2,631.5 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to a A518.7 million increase in revenue in
2011 due to the fact that we consolidated the results of ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming for a five month
period in 2011, increase in revenue in 2011 due to new contracts in the US, Russia, Brazil, Mexico,
Argentina, China, India, Poland, the UK and Spain and increase in revenue associated with additional
sales under existing contracts.

_Mechanisms._ Revenue increased by A257.6 million, or 59.5%, to A690.7 million in 2011 from
A433.1 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to the fact that we consolidated the results of
Edscha for a twelve-month period in 2011.

_Tooling and Other._ Revenue increased by A189.5 million, or 179.1%, to A295.3 million in 2011 from
A105.8 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to completion of greenfield projects and sale of
tooling kits for our new production lines in the US, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, China, India,
Poland, the UK and Spain.

**_Operating expenses_**

_Raw materials and other consumables._ Raw materials and other consumables increased by
A1,125.4 million, or 55.2%, to A3,165.3 million in 2011 from A2,039.9 million in 2010. This increase was
primarily due to the fact that we consolidated the results of Edscha for a twelve-month period in 2011, of
the ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming for a five month period in 2011 and of Gestamp South Carolina LLC for
a twelve-month period in 2011. The increase was also due to new contracts in the US, Russia, Brazil,
Mexico, Argentina, China, India, Poland, the UK and Spain, additional sales under existing contracts and
to increases in the price of steel. The higher percentage of increase in raw materials and other consumables
in 2011 in contrast to revenue in 2011 is primarily due to increases in raw material prices and increases in
the amount of material used, the latter in connection with try-outs in new projects in launch phase.

_Personnel Expenses._ Personnel expenses increased by A198.3 million, or 37.0%, to A733.9 million in 2011
from A535.6 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to a A28.4 million increase in personnel
expenses in 2011 due to the fact that we consolidated the results of Edscha for a twelve-month period in
2011, a A93.5 million increase in personnel expenses in 2011 due to the fact that we consolidated the results
of ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming for a five month period in 2011, an increase in full time employees due to
the ramp up of our new factories and the increase in the average salary of our employees.

_Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses._ Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses
increased by A44.1 million, or 22.4%, to A240.6 million in 2011 from A196.5 million in 2010. This increase
was primarily due to a A9.2 million increase in depreciation due to the fact that we consolidated the results
of Edscha for a twelve-month period in 2011, a A26.8 million increase in depreciation due to the fact that
we consolidated the results of ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming for a five month period in 2011 and higher
depreciation due to our increased asset base compared to the prior year.

_Other Operating Expenses._ Other operating expenses increased by A148.1 million, or 46.4%, to
A467.3 million in 2011 from A319.2 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to a A22.8 million
increase in other operating expenses due to the fact that we consolidated the results of Edscha for a

57


-----

twelve-month period in 2011, a A63.8 million increase in other operating expenses due to the fact that we
consolidated the results of ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming for a five month period in 2011 and an increase
in other operating expenses associated with startup costs of projects in the US, Russia, Brazil, Mexico,
Argentina, China, India, Poland, the UK and Spain.

**_Operating profit or loss_**

Operating profit increased by A113.3 million, or 58.6%, to A306.8 million in 2011 from A193.5 million in
2010. This increase was primarily due to the fact that we consolidated the results of Edscha for a twelvemonth period in 2011 and that we consolidated the results of ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming for a five
month period in 2011. Operating margin, operating profit over revenue, has increased from 6.1% in 2010
to 6.4% in 2011 due to the fact that operating margins in Edscha are higher than the operating margins in
the rest of our group, partially offset by the fact that the operating margins of ThyssenKrupp Metal
Forming are lower than the operating margins in the rest of our group, as ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming is
a newly acquired business that we are still in the process of integrating with the rest of our business.

**_EBITDA_**

EBITDA increased by A157.4 million, or 40.4%, to A547.4 million in 2011 from A390.0 million in 2010
primarily due to a greater increase in revenue than in our operating expenses

**_Net financial expenses_**

Net financial expense increased by A5.6 million, or 9.8%, to A62.5 million in 2011 from A56.9 million in
2010. This increase was primarily due to a weighted average increase in financial debt of A194.2 million for
the year partially offset by a lower average effective interest rate than the prior year.

**_Income Tax_**

Income tax expense increased by A24.4 million, or 73.9%, to A57.4 million in 2011 from A33.0 million in
2010, which has resulted in an increase in the average tax rate from 22.6% in 2010 to 25.0% in 2011. This
increase in the income tax was primarily due to an increase in taxable income in 2011 generated in
jurisdictions with higher tax rates like the US, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Germany.

**_Profit attributable to non-controlling interest_**

Profit attributable to non-controlling interest increased by A2.4 million, or 141.2%, to A4.1 million in 2011
from A1.7 million in 2010. This increase in profit attributable to our non-controlling interest is attributable
to the higher profits achieved by our subsidiaries in which third parties hold a minority interest, such as our
joint ventures in China and Russia and our tooling companies and the fact that we consolidated the results
of ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming for a five month period in 2011.

Our net cash flows from operating activities were A371.5 million in 2012 primarily attributable to the profit
for the year before taxes and after non-controlling interest of A246.6 million, attributable to increased
activity, depreciation and amortization of A280.6 million, working capital requirements of A85.6 million and
payments of income tax of A66.4 million.

Our net cash flows from operating activities were A307.6 million in 2011 primarily attributable to profit for
the year before taxes and after non-controlling interest of A225.9 million, attributable to increased activity,
depreciation and amortization of A292.4 million, payments of income tax of A21.0 million and working
capital requirements of A129.6 million.

Our net cash flows from operating activities were A271.2 million in 2010 primarily attributable to profit for
the year before taxes and after non-controlling interest of A144.4 million, attributable to increased activity,
depreciation and amortization of A196.5 million, payments of income tax of A20.4 million and working
capital requirements of A61.5 million.

**_Cash flows from (used in) investing activities_**

Our net cash flows used in investing activities were A579.2 million in 2012, primarily attributable to
A533.9 million used in investments in new projects in the US, Brazil and Russia and maintenance and
replacement capital expenditure.

Our net cash flows used in investing activities were A622.7 million in 2011 attributable to A422.1 million
used for acquisitions, of which A383.8 million was used for the acquisition of ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming
and A299.4 million was used for new projects in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, the US, China and India, and
also attributable to maintenance and replacement capital expenditure partially offset by A90.4 million from
divestments.

Our net cash flows used in investing activities were A326.1 million in 2010 attributable to A148.9 million
used for acquisitions, of which A129.9 million was used for the acquisition of Edscha and A303.1 million was
used for new projects in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, the US, China and India, and also attributable to
maintenance and replacement capital expenditure partially offset by A136.5 million from divestments.

**_Cash flows from financing activities_**

Our net cash flows from financing activities were A196.5 million in 2012, attributable to an increase in our
net indebtedness of A242.6 million and partially offset by payment of dividends to our shareholders of
A50.5 million.

Our net cash flows from financing activities were A240.5 million in 2011, attributable to A137.7 million
received from the sale of a minority interest in ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming and an increase in our net
indebtedness of A128.0 million and partially offset by payment of dividends to our shareholders of
A33.4 million.

Our net cash flows from financing activities were A199.4 million in 2010, attributable to an increase in our
net indebtedness of A153.0 million, a A47.9 million increase in cash flows mainly due to the sale of our
minority interest in our Russian business and partially offset by payment of dividends to our shareholders
of A9.3 million.

**Liquidity**

Our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flow, which is analyzed above. Our ability to
generate cash from our operations depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn
dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other
factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in the section entitled
_‘‘Risk Factors.’’_

Following the issuance of the notes and the repayment of certain of our long-term indebtedness, our
long-term indebtedness (excluding the notes and the Senior Facilities) will primarily consist of the
A60.0 million Banc of America loan and A111.3 million of aggregate principal amount in other local
facilities. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness’’.

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings and
cash on hand, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, we cannot assure
you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity
financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including
the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include:

- a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of operating profit from our operations, which
could be caused by a downturn in our performance or in the industry as a whole;

- the failure or delay of our customers to make payments due to us;

- a delay by our customers to make payments due to us;

- a failure to maintain low working capital requirements; and

- the need to fund expansion and other development capital expenditures.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under our
current or any future credit facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our
liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

- sell our assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of the notes and any future debt may limit our ability to
pursue any of these alternatives.

In addition, historically we have paid dividends to our shareholders of A9.3 million in 2010, A33.4 million in
2011 and A50.5 million in 2012. Our board of directors has recently proposed the payment of a dividend of
A51.0 million to our shareholders. This dividend payment is expected to be approved at a meeting of our

61


-----

shareholders no later than June 30, 2013 and if approved, such dividend shall be paid no later than 60 days
after June 30, 2013.

We are leveraged and have debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2012 and as adjusted to give pro
forma effect to this offering, the entering into of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Mitsui Investment
and the transactions contemplated hereby, we would have had approximately A1,835.4 million of total
financial debt. We anticipate that our leverage will continue for the foreseeable future. Our level of debt
may have important negative consequences for you. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks related to the notes’’.

Our working capital requirements largely arise from our trade receivables, which are primarily composed
of amounts owed to us by our customers, inventories primarily composed of raw materials (mainly steel)
and other current assets which comprise receivables accounts with the public treasury by the advanced
payments of taxes or refunds of taxes. Our trade payables primarily relate to trade payables to our
suppliers for raw materials, services and fixed assets, other amounts to the public treasury for taxes and
payments to our employees by way of salaries. We have historically funded our working capital
requirements through funds generated from our operations, from borrowings under bank facilities and
through funds from other finance sources.

Net working capital increased by A85.5 million in 2012 as compared to an increase of A129.6 million in
2011. In 2012, working capital requirements increased by A33.7 million primarily as a result of a reduction
in the average days for payment of trade payables from 64 days in 2011 to 58 days in 2012, which in turn
was largely due to new legislation in Spain requiring the earlier payment to suppliers and higher activity in
jurisdictions with shorter average payment periods such as Germany and the US, partially offset by a
reduction in the average days for collection of trade receivables from 47 days in 2011 to 41 days in 2012
due to higher activity in jurisdictions with shorter average payment periods such as Germany and the US
and also as a result of an increase in our inventories due to increased levels of activity but with similar lead
times for inventory as in the prior year. Working capital requirements increased by A61.7 million primarily
due to an increase in the average days for raw materials from 18 days in 2011 to 23 days in 2012, which in
turn was largely attributable to stocks in new facilities that were in ramp-up phase.

Net working capital requirements increased in 2011 by A129.6 million as compared to an increase of
A61.5 million in 2010. This was primarily attributable to a reduction in the average days for payment of
trade payables from 71 days in 2010 to 64 days in 2011 due to new legislation in Spain requiring the earlier
payment to suppliers and higher activity in jurisdictions with shorter average payment periods such as
Germany and the US, partially offset by a reduction in the average days for collection of trade receivables
from 51 days in 2010 to 47 days in 2011 due to higher activity in jurisdictions with shorter average payment
periods such as Germany and the US.

We anticipate that our working capital requirements in the foreseeable future will generally be stable as a
percentage of revenue. However, these requirements can fluctuate for a variety of factors, including any
significant increase in receivables due to longer time periods to collect payment from our customers or a
substantial increase in the cost of our raw materials. We undertake both non-recourse and recourse
factoring in relation to our trade receivables. Under our non-recourse factoring, we transfer our trade
receivables to banks that pay us the entire amount of the receivable. Payments from our customers are
made into a designated bank account and we pass on the payment to the factor with an additional interest
payment. The receivables balances transferred by us as non-recourse factoring to Spanish, German and

62


-----

Polish banks, that have been eliminated in our financial statements amounted to A119.7 million in 2012 as
compared to A44.8 million in 2011. The expense of transferring receivables balances through non-recourse
factoring contracts amounted to A0.8 million in 2012 as compared to A0.3 million in 2011. There are no
off-balance sheet arrangements associated with our factoring arrangements.

**Capital expenditures**

The following table sets forth our capital expenditures for the periods indicated:

**As of December 31,**
**2010** **2011** **2012**
**(E’millions)**
Capital expenditures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 230.0 340.4 590.9
Net proceeds used in (from) acquisition and disposal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 112.4 380.7 4.0

Capital expenditures during 2010, 2011 and 2012 amounted to approximately A230.0 million, A340.4 million
and A590.9 million. We define capital expenditures as consisting primarily of expenditure on property,
plant and equipment. This includes expenditure on new manufacturing plants and expansion of existing
plant capacity for new production lines, maintenance capital expenditure comprising expenditures on
maintenance of machinery and buildings, improvements of existing plants driven by health and safety and
noise reduction concerns and replacement capital expenditure incurred when we change the engineering of
our production platforms in connection with new models. Replacement capital expenditure is primarily
incurred in connection with updating our welding and assembly cells and equipment, given that the most
costly categories of our infrastructure, such as land, buildings and press equipment, have long lives and can
be adapted with relatively low expenditure for replacement or renewal business. Our estimated capital
expenditure budget for 2013 is similar to our capital expenditure in 2012 as we will complete in 2013
certain of our greenfield projects from prior years. However, in 2014 and 2015, we expect that our capital
expenditure will be substantially less than 2012 and 2013 as we expect to consolidate our expansion and
acquisitions from prior years.

We define acquisitions and dispositions to include cash flows used in investments in group companies and
associates less cash flows from divestments of group companies and associates.

**Contractual obligations**

We have contractual commitments providing for payments primarily pursuant to our outstanding financial
debt, including the financial obligations arising from the notes but excluding financial derivatives.

Our consolidated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012, after giving pro forma effect to this
offering, the entering into of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Mitsui Investment and the application of
the proceeds therefrom, were as follows:

**Off-balance sheet arrangements**

We generally do not utilize off-balance sheet arrangements. Under our agreement with Liberty, we have an
option to purchase the shares in GMF Holding, held by Tocqueville, for a fixed purchase price of
A104.0 million on or prior to September 30, 2013. If we fail to exercise the Liberty option and if the sale
price realized by Liberty in a sale to a third party or third parties is lower than A104.0 million, then we will
be obligated to pay Liberty an amount such that the minority shareholder would receive an aggregate of

63


-----

A104.0 million for its shares. Under the terms of the Soci´et´e G´en´erale Guaranteed Back-up Facility
Agreement, in the event that Tocquevile Capital Company, B.V. receives an amount of less than
A104.0 million in the sale of its shares in GMF Holding to a third party, Soci´et´e G´en´erale has agreed to
make available to Gestamp Metalbages, S.A. a term loan facility up to A104.0 million that allows
Tocquevile Capital Company, B.V. to receive an aggregate of A104.0 million. The Soci´et´e G´en´erale
Guaranteed Back-up facility Agreement terminates on September 5, 2013. Further, we have also given a
guarantee in respect of the EIB loan and the ICO loan. Please see ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—
Existing Debt Facilities—EIB loan and ICO loan’’.

**Critical accounting policies**

Our financial statements and the accompanying Notes contain information that is pertinent to this
discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with IFRS requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are evaluated based on available information and experience.
Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a detailed
description of our critical accounting policies, see Note 2.4 to our consolidated financial statements for the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 included elsewhere in these listing particulars.

**Market risks**

Our treasury team is responsible for managing our exposure to financial risk and for minimizing the
potential adverse effects on our financial returns. We are primarily exposed to market risk from changes in
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and we are also exposed to liquidity risk and credit risk.
We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities.

**_Foreign currency risks_**

In the year ended December 31, 2012, A3,171.9 million of our revenues (which represented approximately
55.1% of our revenue for that period), on a consolidated basis, were generated in currencies other than the
Euro. Our strategy for managing currency risk relies primarily on conducting business and making
investments in a foreign country in that country’s currency. The effects on us of foreign currency
fluctuations are mitigated by the fact that expenses are generally incurred in the same currency in which
revenues are generated.

However, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the currency in which a transaction is denominated
and our presentation currency, the euro, can have some negative or positive impact on our profit or loss,
specifically affecting management of our financial debt.

We mainly operate in the following currencies: Argentine Peso, Brazilian Real, Chinese Yuan, Czech
Crown, Euro, GB Pound, Hungarian Forint, Indian Rupee, Korean Won, Mexican Peso, Polish Zloty,
Russian Ruble, Swedish Crown, Taiwanese Dollar, Turkish Lira, US Dollar and Japanese Yen.

To manage exchange rate risk, we use a series of financial instruments that give us a degree of flexibility,
essentially comprised of the following:

- Foreign currency forward contracts: These arrangements lock in the price at which an entity can buy
or sell a currency on a set date; the timing can be adjusted to align the transactions with the hedged
cash flows.

- ‘‘Puttable instruments’’: Other derivatives are also used to hedge currency risk, including those
designed to lock in a maximum or minimum exchange rate (collar or tunnel) at a set settlement date.

The following table demonstrates the notional impact on our profits of a 5% positive and negative

(1) Effect in relative terms is calculated by dividing impact in absolute terms by Profit attributable to equity holders of parent
company of A170.1 million.

We hold hedges contracted for net foreign investments to cover the exposure to changes in exchange rates
with respect to the interest in the net assets of foreign operations. These financial derivatives hedging net
foreign investments are initially recognized in our balance sheet at acquisition cost and, subsequently, they
are marked to market. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the market value of derivatives in
respect of the ineffective portion of an effective hedge are taken directly to the consolidated income
statement, while gains or losses on the effective portion are recognized in ‘‘Effective hedges’’ within
‘‘Retained earnings’’ with respect to cash flow hedges, and in ‘‘Translation differences’’ with respect to net
foreign investment hedges. The cumulative gain or loss recognized in equity is taken to the consolidated
income statement when the hedged item affects profit or loss or in the year of disposal of the item.
Derivatives are recognized as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is
negative.

**_Interest rate risks_**

Our borrowings mainly bear interest at floating rates, exposing us to risk from fluctuations in market
interest rates, so that market fluctuations affect cash flows. We mitigate this risk by using interest rate
derivatives/hedges, through entities that operate on organized markets. These instruments are used to
hedge exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates on a portion of the bank loans granted to us and on
a portion of expected future borrowings. We use mainly swaps, by which we convert the floating rate on a
loan into a fixed rate. We may swap the rate on a portion of the loan or on the entire loan, and for its
entire duration or a part thereof. Virtually all of our borrowings are at floating rates indexed to Euribor.

Assuming a 35 basis point variation in the average interest rate on our euro denominated financial
borrowings and assuming that all other variables remained constant, the finance cost would have been
A0.34 million, A0.98 million and A1.09 million higher or lower in 2010, 2011 and 2012 respectively.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that a company will not be able to service its commitments as a result of
adverse conditions in the debt markets that prevent or hinder its capital raising efforts. We manage

65


-----

liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash balances to enable us to negotiate refinancing on the best
possible terms and to cover our near term cash outlays, thereby avoiding the need to raise funds on
disadvantageous terms.

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is concentrated primarily in our accounts receivable. Our management considers that our
counterparties are creditworthy, multinational companies. We manage our credit risk according to policies,
procedures and controls determined by us regarding credit risk management of customers. At each closing
date, we analyze on the basis of real historical data the balances of each major client individually in order
to determine the need for provisions or impairment. We have no guarantee on debts and have concluded
that the risk concentration is low given that our customers belong to distinct jurisdictions and operate in
highly independent markets. Our credit risk with banks is managed by our treasury department according
to our policies. The surplus cash investments are contracted only with authorized counterparties and
always within the credit limit assigned for each counterparty. The limits are established in order to
minimize risk concentration, thereby mitigating financial losses in the event of a default by the
counterparty. Our maximum exposure to credit risk at December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 amounts to the
carrying values, except for financial guarantees and derivative financial instruments.

**_Commodity risk_**

The primary raw material used in our business is steel. We are mostly neutral to changes in the price of
steel as a result of our pass-through arrangements with OEMs, which provide us a natural hedge.

**INDUSTRY**

_You should read the following discussion together with the sections entitled ‘‘Selected Financial Information’’,_
_‘‘Risk Factors’’ and ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements’’._

**Introduction**

The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, sells and services motor vehicles which
are classified into light vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles. The light vehicle segment is comprised of
passenger cars, vans and light trucks (with gross vehicle weight of less than six tons), while the heavy
commercial vehicle segment consists of vehicles with gross vehicle weight greater than six tons.

The automotive production value chain is split between OEMs such as Daimler, Ford, General Motors,
Toyota and Volkswagen and automotive suppliers, such as Bosch, Continental, Denso and Magna
International. Automotive suppliers are then further categorized into three different tiers. Tier 1 suppliers
sell their products directly to OEMs. Typically these products are larger modules or systems which
integrate components from Tier 2 automotive suppliers. Tier 2 suppliers in turn typically integrate products
from a further layer of suppliers (Tier 3 suppliers). A clear delineation of the suppliers as Tier 1, Tier 2 or
Tier 3 is not always possible because suppliers often manufacture and sell numerous products or product
groups.

Automotive suppliers can also be categorized as captive or independent. Captive suppliers are fully or
partially owned by OEMs or serve a single OEM (one example would be the Keiretsu system in Japan).
Independent suppliers like Gestamp are not owned by OEMs and can serve multiple OEMs. In addition,
some components are sold directly to the independent automotive aftermarket rather than to the
OEMs and their own aftermarket networks.

The group of automotive suppliers is typically further divided into sub-segments based on their
components’ function within the car. Each of these sub-segments is comprised of various product groups.
A typical classification of automotive suppliers by vehicle function could include the following
sub-segments: powertrain, body and structural, electronics, interior, transmission, suspension, climate
control, wheels & tires, steering, fuel systems, passenger restraints, audio & telematics, exhaust and body
glass. There are many different market leaders in the respective market niches. Consequently, a consistent
definition of these niche markets does not often exist, and it is very difficult to determine the market
position of an individual supplier by using objective criteria.

**Overview of body and structural market**

We mainly act as a Tier 1 supplier to OEMs in the body and structural market. The body and structural
market in the broader sense is comprised of all the products and components that form the structural
elements of the car as well as its outer skin. Body and structural components typically represent a
substantial part of the overall vehicle weight. Products that are typically included within this category
include among others: bumpers (also including shocks), chassis, cross members, doors (also including
frames and panels), fascias, fenders, floors, grilles, handles, hinges, hoods (also including liners, releases
and support rods), latches, locking systems, pedal boxes, rails, reflectors, roll bars, roofs, side body panels,
skid plates, splash guards, spoilers, subframes, wheel arches and window regulators.

Key trends in the body and structural market include the push towards further weight reduction aimed at
lowering fuel consumption and, thereby, carbon dioxide emissions. This is being achieved through gradual
weight optimization within established component technologies as well as through the development of
new, lighter technologies and materials. Examples for new technologies and materials include the use of
alternative materials for body components, such as replacing conventional steel components with parts
made of high strength steel, aluminum or carbon fiber reinforced plastics. Manufacturing components
from lighter materials such as aluminum typically comes with substantial cost increases compared to
conventional steel parts, with disproportionate increases in cost for the lightest materials, and so demand
for such parts is currently limited.

The drive towards weight reduction in body and structural components is partially driven by governmental
regulation concerning carbon dioxide and emission standards throughout the industrial world, including
the European Union, the United States and Japan, as well as by increasing cost and environmental
awareness among end product consumers.

The body and structural market is also characterized by increasing safety standards. Together with
dedicated passive safety parts such as airbags and seatbelts, body and structural components protect car
occupants in the case of a crash and also directly influence the damage inflicted on other parties involved
in a collision.

The body and structural market is additionally impacted by trends affecting the automotive sector in
general described under ‘‘—Market and industry trends’’.

**Market development by region**

As an automotive supplier, our revenue development is linked to the development of automotive
production numbers and changes in the content per vehicle for the automotive components we produce.
The following is a brief description of selected historical and forecast light vehicle production in key
regions and selected countries in which we operate, as well as selected annualized growth rates in
production. Both historical and forecast data is based on data published by an independent third party
provider. There can be no assurance that any of the forecasts presented below will be accurate.

**_Western Europe_**

Following the financial crisis in 2008/2009, the automotive industry in Western Europe went through a
challenging period with several supplier insolvencies, substantial overcapacity and capacity reduction
efforts, as well as reduced investment. Thereafter, Western Europe experienced a period of strong growth
in automotive production, from 13.4 million vehicles in 2009 to 16.6 million vehicles in 2011 (representing
a CAGR of 11.4%). Growth during this period was particularly strong in Germany and the United
Kingdom, which experienced automotive production growth between 2009 and 2011 at a CAGR of 9.5%
and 15.7%, respectively.

By 2017, automotive production in the region is expected to grow to 18.0 million vehicles, representing a
2011-17 CAGR of 1.4%. This figure varies from country to country, for example automotive production
growth of (1.8)% is expected in France, 0.3% in Germany, and 2.2% in Spain. In general, the region
continues to have some overcapacity. This trend has encouraged OEMs to focus growth in production
facilities towards Eastern Europe and to Asia where demand continued to grow throughout the financial
crisis.

**_Eastern Europe_**

A production shift from Western to Eastern Europe has gradually taken place over the past decade. This
trend was reinforced with the introduction of so-called ‘scrapping schemes’ by a number of European
countries in 2008/2009 (since withdrawn), including Austria, France, Germany and Spain. The schemes
were designed to support the automotive industry during the crisis, and offered ‘scrappage’ premiums to
consumers buying a new car, in return for ‘‘scrapping’’ their older cars. The schemes tended to favor
smaller, low-cost vehicles, a significant portion of which were produced in Eastern Europe. This helped to
drive automotive production growth in Eastern Europe from 3.1 million vehicles in 2009 to 3.6 million
vehicles in 2011, representing a 2009-11 CAGR of 6.9%. Continued investment by OEMs in the region is
expected, given the competitive labor costs and local demand for light vehicles with OEMs steadily
expanding their presence. Consequently, automotive production is expected to increase to 3.9 million
vehicles in 2017, representing a 2011-17 CAGR of 1.4%.

**_North America_**

North American car manufacturers faced significant challenges in the 2008-09 crisis, and the
US government provided ‘‘bail-outs’’ to Chrysler and General Motors. Subsequently, production volumes
rebounded from 8.6 million vehicles in 2009 to 13.1 million vehicles in 2011, representing a CAGR of
23.7%. This growth was driven by improvement in the broader macroeconomic environment and consumer
sentiment, as well as low interest rates. By 2017, automotive production in the region is projected to grow
to 17.6 million vehicles, representing a CAGR of 5.0%. A continuing trend in North America is the fast
growing European ‘‘transplants’’, or localization of European OEM production capacity in North America.

71


-----

**_South America_**

Automotive production in South America experienced significant growth between 2009 and 2011, growing
from 3.7 million vehicles to 4.3 million vehicles, representing a CAGR of 8.1%. By 2017, automotive
production is projected to reach 5.8 million vehicles, representing a CAGR of 4.9%.

Within South America, Brazil is the largest automotive production market. Automotive production in
Brazil grew from 2.9 million vehicles in 2009 to 3.2 million vehicles in 2011, representing a CAGR of 3.7%.
By 2017, automotive production is projected to reach 4.2 million vehicles, representing a CAGR of 5.1%.
The Brazilian government introduced tariffs and raised the tax on imported cars at the end of 2011, with
further measures including tax breaks for OEMs if they did more engineering work in Brazil and used
Brazilian automotive suppliers. On the demand side, Brazil introduced tax breaks on vehicles in 2012 to
stimulate both sales and production.

**_Asia_**

The key automotive manufacturing countries in the region are China, followed by Japan, Korea and India.
Overall, the crisis had a limited impact on the region, but was more pronounced in Japan and Korea, with
Chinese manufacturing volumes remaining strong through the cycle. Automotive production in Asia grew
from 28.6 million vehicles in 2009 to 36.5 million vehicles in 2011, representing a CAGR of 13.1%. By
2017, automotive production is projected to reach 52.1 million vehicles, representing a CAGR of 6.1%.

In recent years, China has become a key growth market with a number of OEMs and suppliers establishing
production facilities in the country. As a result, automotive production in China grew at a CAGR of 16.0%
between 2009 and 2011 (from 12.8 million vehicles in 2009 to 17.3 million vehicles in 2011), and is
projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.2% between 2011 and 2017 (to 27.7 million vehicles in 2017). A similar
trend is observed in India, where automotive production grew at a CAGR of 20.9% between 2009 and 2011
(from 2.5 million vehicles in 2009 to 3.6 million vehicles in 2011), and is projected to grow at a CAGR of
9.3% between 2011 and 2017 (to 6.1 million vehicles in 2017).

**Market and industry trends**

The global automotive supplier market is characterized by the following trends and growth factors:

**_The regional shift of the automotive industry will continue, intensified by the continuous increase in demand_**
**_for vehicles in growth markets_**

The automotive industry has become increasingly global with numerous production plants being
established in growth markets. OEMs are locating production facilities to these regions in order to satisfy
increasing local demand, most notably from China and India. Market penetration in growth countries
remains low. This trend is also expected to apply to automotive suppliers, whereby suppliers will follow
their OEM customers and establish production facilities in close proximity to those of the vehicle
manufacturers. The Chinese and Indian auto supplier markets have grown significantly over the last ten
years, even throughout the 2008/2009 crisis, and their high growth rates are expected to be sustained in the
coming years.

**_The move to common platforms is resulting in increased consolidation and closer cooperation between_**
**_suppliers and OEMs_**

The automotive supplier industry is currently in a transition phase. Consolidation is expected to continue
driven by cooperation amongst OEMs, strengthened common platform strategies (utilization of the same
core car design platform for various distinct models) and the restructuring and insolvency of midsize
suppliers. Consequently a number of larger suppliers will evolve which are able to produce large volumes,
are financially sound and have a broad product offering. This new generation of automotive suppliers is
expected to have a closer relationship with OEMs and stronger bargaining power than their midsize
competitors. The increased specialization and ‘‘modularization’’ (production of components with
standardized product features, which can be used for a wider range of vehicles) will enable suppliers to
manufacture larger volumes of certain products. OEMs are developing a collaborative relationship with
their suppliers, which has allowed them to optimize the value chain and better positions them for structural
challenges in the automotive industry. For suppliers, this collaboration is important as it allows them to
avoid redundant investments and reduce their product development costs. Such strategic partnerships hold
potential for cost reduction.

72


-----

**_The market share of low-cost and premium automotive segments is expected to increase at the expense of the_**
**_volume segment_**

In the long term, the automotive market is expected to shift focus away from mid-market towards low-tech
and low-cost vehicles on the one hand and function-oriented, innovative vehicles for premium customers
on the other. By the year 2015, low-cost segment market share is expected to increase to approximately
20% (11% in 2005) with the share of the premium segment increasing to approximately 26% (22% in
2005). In recent years, the market share of low-cost passenger cars (i.e. cars costing less than US$10,000 /
A7,000) has been increasing, predominantly in China, India, Brazil and Eastern Europe, and sales of small
passenger cars are expected to grow further. These cars are mainly manufactured and sold in high-growth
countries in Asia, as well as in Brazil and Eastern Europe. Growth in the premium segment is also
expected to be driven by growth markets, including China, India, the Middle East and Africa. Vehicles in
the premium segment tend to be more technologically advanced in each sub-segment of automotive
components, including body and structural.

**_Stricter carbon dioxide emission regulations worldwide forcing OEMs to improve fuel efficiency and_**
**_environmental friendliness of vehicles_**

The development and production of fuel-efficient vehicles is a key growth trend in the automotive sector.
It is driven by consumers’ preference to save money on fuel (particularly given rising oil prices) and
regulatory factors. Furthermore, increasing social and environmental awareness among end consumers is
expected to play a greater role in vehicle purchase decisions. Consequently, OEMs face on-going pressure
to improve the fuel efficiency of their vehicles and thereby reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The
regulatory obligation to improve the efficiency of existing technologies and to develop new
environmentally-friendly technologies, aimed at reducing fuel consumption and a consequent reduction in
carbon dioxide emissions, is becoming a key focus for OEMs given stringent carbon dioxide consumption
and emission standards throughout the industrial world, including the European Union, the United States,
China and Japan. For example, to avoid the imposition of penalty payments EU car manufacturers’ fleet
average for passenger cars must comply with carbon dioxide emission limits of 130 g/km by 2015, and this
target is proposed to reduce to around 95g/km by 2020.

**_Emission of pollutant substances (other than carbon dioxide) by vehicles will also be reduced, especially by_**
**_vehicles with diesel engines_**

The development and production of innovative components and systems contributing to emission
reduction is a key growth area in the automotive sector. Many countries have adopted emission regulations
which set limits on the amount of pollutants that new vehicles can emit. These regulations limit, in
particular, the emission of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and particulate matter, all of
which are considered harmful to human health. Within the next several years emission limits worldwide are
expected to become increasingly restrictive given growing environmental awareness. Regulations have
been adopted in both developed and in growth markets; Brazil, India and China, for example, tend to
adopt similar regulations a few years after they have been approved in Europe. The emission limits for
nitrogen oxides and particulate matters emitted by diesel vehicles are expected to face most substantial
reductions. In the European Union, for example, the regulatory standard Euro 6, which will become
compulsory for all new passenger cars in 2015, reduces the emission limit of nitrogen oxides for diesel
vehicles from 180 mg/km today to 80 mg/km. The tightening of emission regulation worldwide will drive
demand for more eco-friendly products, forcing OEMs and suppliers to develop innovative components
and systems which comply with the more restrictive emission legislation.

**_Increasing number of electric and hybrid cars and the emergence of hydrogen-powered vehicles_**

Consumers are becoming increasingly environmentally conscious and this is affecting their vehicle
purchase choice. A rising number of both electric and hybrid vehicles can be observed on the roads, with
hybrids being more popular than purely electric vehicles. However, the rates of adoption of these vehicles
has so far been relatively slow, largely due to their relatively high price, short driving range and the lack of
battery re-charging infrastructure, even in developed countries. Market observers predict that it will be a
number of years until battery technology is improved and becomes affordable for mainstream use in
automobiles. Moreover, it will also take some time to develop charging stations to support these types of
vehicles. Once these obstacles have been overcome, take-up of both hybrid and electric cars is likely to
increase. During this stage we are likely to see an increase in the number of automotive suppliers who
manufacture electric motors, advanced automotive batteries as well as semiconductor, connectors and

73


-----

sensors which the vehicles will need. The impact on chassis and Body-in-White automotive suppliers is
likely to be relatively limited, with only amendments to existing technology.

**Stable market dynamics**

A majority of the markets in which we are active are increasingly consolidated in nature, typically with
three to five global key competitors. We believe that there are a number of challenging requirements for
global automotive suppliers that, in part, are linked to the global trends that have developed in the industry
and that a new or less well established market player would have to satisfy in order to establish themselves
in the market.

**_Established OEM relationships_**

We and our key competitors have longstanding relationships with automotive OEMs, developed through
long-standing close collaboration. The systems and components provided to our OEM customers are
critical in nature. Therefore, OEMs choose their suppliers carefully based on a number of criteria. In
addition, OEMs outsource an increasing amount of content to suppliers that continue proving their
capabilities over time, such that they are fully involved within the complete vehicle development value
chain. We believe that when entering this market, potential competitors would need to spend many years
developing a track record with these customers before shifting from being a ‘‘build-to-print’’ supplier to a
full strategic partner.

**_Technological capabilities_**

We and our key competitors have made significant investments to develop state-of-the-art technologies
across a broad range of processes, in order to be at the forefront of weight-reduction and certification of
safety standards, as well as customer preferences on design and other factors. This has been carried out
through extensive and sustained R&D activities over a number of years, increasingly in collaboration with
OEMs. In addition, technological capabilities also extend to tooling competencies across the entire value
chain, from design to manufacturing and testing. We believe that these advanced capabilities act as a
challenging pre-requisite for potential new competitors in our markets.

**_Global manufacturing footprint_**

Automotive OEMs are increasingly shifting to common vehicle platforms on a global basis with the aim of
maximizing the commonality of components and systems, and to derive cost savings via economies of scale.
Consequently, OEMs are increasingly looking for global suppliers that can provide standardized
components with consistent quality standards globally, at a competitive cost and with close proximity to
OEM production sites. We believe that it would be difficult for potential competitors to achieve such a
broad geographical (human resources and physical plant) footprint without many years of investment.

**_Scale_**

Entry into most of the markets in which we and our competitors are active requires substantial investments
which we believe many potential competitors would not be able or would not be willing to make. As we
manufacture most of our products in large volumes, we have been able to significantly reduce costs per
unit. In our view, when entering the market most potential competitors would have to incur higher costs
per unit if they were to seek to manufacture products with the same quality as ours.

**_Track record of financial stability_**

A key success factor for automotive suppliers is financial stability, as this is an important factor considered
by OEMs when making purchasing decisions. During the downturn in 2008/2009, many OEMs faced supply
chain difficulties as a result of certain suppliers falling into financial distress and therefore being unable to
fulfill their contractual obligations to supply automotive components. Therefore, there has been a
structural shift in OEM preferences to work increasingly with larger and more financially stable suppliers.
Consequently, this is making it more difficult for financially weaker or unproven competitors to enter into
our addressable markets.

74


-----

**Regulatory environment**

We are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to our business activities in the countries in which we
operate. Moreover, the products manufactured by us have to comply with various legal requirements. The
general regulatory conditions applicable to our operations and products are subject to change, and are
continuously being adapted at both national and international levels (especially by the European Union),
following the steady technological development, the increased need for safety and the environmental
consciousness of the population. As regional laws and regulations addressing emissions from vehicles are
highly complex and detailed, including the regulation of various special and exceptional cases, we have
limited the following description to an overview of certain principal provisions. As far as future regulations
are concerned, governments may decide to delay the introduction of such regulations or to change the
emission limits set by such regulations or not to introduce such regulations at all (in contrast to their
current plan).

**Emissions from Vehicles**

**_Carbon dioxide emission regulations_**

As the growing number of motor vehicles contributes significantly to the output of greenhouse gases, one
regulatory focus is limiting carbon dioxide emissions from road vehicles. Carbon dioxide emission or fuel
economy standards are already in place in Europe, the United States, Japan and China, amongst other
countries. Brazil and India are expected to initiate similar measures in the near future. Carbon dioxide
emissions are regulated separately for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in Europe.

**_Europe_**

_Passenger Cars_

As a result of Regulation 443/2009/EC, effective as of January 1, 2012, the EU car manufacturers’ fleet
average for passenger cars must comply with the new limit for carbon dioxide emission of 130 g/km—
partially as of 2012 and completely by 2015. In 2012, 65% of each manufacturer’s lowest emitting cars
newly registered in that year must comply with the emission limit (2013: 75% and 2014: 80%). By 2015,
100% of the newly registered passenger cars will finally be included in the calculation of the fleet average.
The carbon dioxide emission used to calculate the fleet average are taken for all vehicle types offered by
the manufacturer and represent the allowable levels of carbon dioxide emission for the respective vehicle
type. If the actual carbon dioxide emissions of newly registered passenger cars of a particular manufacturer
exceed the limits, the European Commission will impose an excess emission premium on the respective
manufacturer. As regards further reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars, the
European Commission has recently put forward a proposal to implement a limit of 95 g/km by 2020
(COM/2012/393). The proposal has been submitted to the European Parliament and the Council for
discussion and adoption pursuant to the regular legislative process. Whether and if so, in what form this
proposal will be modified in the course of the legislative process is currently uncertain.

_Light Commercial Vehicles_

In June 2011, Regulation 510/2011/EC became effective, setting carbon dioxide emission standards for new
light commercial vehicles in Europe. The regulation applies to new vehicles of category N1 (vehicles for
the transportation of goods, having a maximum mass not exceeding 3.5 tons). Vehicles of the category M2
(vehicles for the transportation of passengers, comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver’s
seat and having a maximum mass not exceeding 5 tons) and N2 (vehicles for the transportation of goods,
having a maximum mass exceeding 3.5 tons but not exceeding 12 tons) will be included for monitoring
purposes only. The target is to reach an emission limit of 175 g/km for new light commercial vehicles in
2017 compared to an average emission level of approximately 185 g/km in 2009. For each manufacturer an
individual limit will be calculated based on an average weight of the manufacturer’s vehicle fleet. These
limits will be phased in, with 70% of each manufacturer’s light commercial vehicles to be taken into
account in 2014, 75% in 2015, 80% in 2016 and 100% from 2017 onwards. Manufacturers failing to meet
the emission limits will be required to pay an excess emission premium. From 2014 to 2017 super-credits
for new light commercial vehicles with carbon dioxide emissions of less than 50 g/km will be in place in
order to stimulate sales of low emission vehicles. As regards further reduction of carbon dioxide emissions
from light commercial vehicles, the European Commission has recently put forward a proposal to
implement a limit of 147 g/km by 2020 (COM/2012/394). The proposal has been submitted to the
European Parliament and the Council for discussion and adoption pursuant to the regular legislative

75


-----

process. Whether and if so, in what form this proposal will be modified in the course of the legislative
process is currently uncertain.

**_United States_**

_Cars and Light Trucks_

In the United States, the NHTSA sets CAFE standards and the EPA sets national greenhouse gas emission
standards. Additionally, California has asserted the right to regulate motor vehicle greenhouse gas
emissions. In order to address this potential regulatory overlap, the EPA and NHTSA have developed a
federal ‘‘One National Program’’ of harmonized regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
improve fuel economy of light duty vehicles for the 2012 to 2016 model years. The CARB has agreed that
compliance with the One National Program will be deemed compliant with California regulations for the
2012 to 2016 model years. The standards apply to passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty
passenger vehicles and require an industry wide target standard of 250 g/mile of carbon-related exhaust
emissions and 34.1 miles per gallon by model year 2016. In 2011, the NHTSA and the EPA issued a joint
proposal extending the National Program to further improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions for passenger cars and light trucks manufactured in model years 2017-2025. The proposed CAFE
standards would require an industry-wide light-duty fleet average of approximately 40.1 miles per gallon by
model year 2021 and approximately 49.6 miles per gallon by model year 2025, based on the assumption
that all of the CO2 emissions reductions are achieved through the use of fuel economy technology. EPA’s
proposed greenhouse gas emission standards, which are harmonized with NHTSA’s CAFE standards, are
projected to require 163g/mile of carbon dioxide in model year 2025.

_Heavy Duty Vehicles_

In 2011, the EPA and NHTSA promulgated final regulations that for the first time impose greenhouse gas
and fuel economy standards on heavy duty vehicles, covering model years 2014 to 2018. The final
regulations are being challenged in federal court. The EPA and NHTSA are expected to issue a new round
of standards covering the 2019 model year and subsequent model years.

**_China_**

China began its passenger vehicle fuel consumption regulation in 2004, when it issued the standard ‘‘Limits
of Fuel Consumption for Passenger Cars’’. This standard, which establishes maximum fuel consumption
limits by vehicle weight category, will be fully implemented by 2015. If the 2015 targets are met, passenger
car fuel consumption is expected to be no greater than 7 l/100 km (under NEDC driving test cycle). Motor
vehicle fuel economy standards in China are based on 16 weight classes and cover passenger cars, Sport
Utility Vehicles (‘‘SUVs’’) and Multi-purpose Vans (‘‘MPVs’’), with separate standards for passenger cars
with manual and automatic transmissions. Vehicles that do not meet the standard are not permitted to be
sold.

**_Laws and regulations regarding emission of pollutant substances (other than carbon dioxide)_**

Many countries have set limits on the amount of pollutants that new vehicles are allowed to emit as part of
a broader strategy to reduce negative health and environmental effects of air pollution. The regulations
limit in particular the emission of carbon monoxide (‘‘CO’’), nitrogen oxides (‘‘NOx’’), hydrocarbons
(‘‘HC’’) and particulate matters (‘‘PM’’), which are considered to be harmful to human health, and apply
to either all vehicles or only certain types. New regulation schemes are getting increasingly stricter
worldwide, and are often first introduced in European and other markets in Europe, North America and
Japan markets. The United States and Japan have adopted similar legislation to the Euro emission
standards, while emerging countries in Asia and South America are gradually adopting European
legislation on emission standards in order to avoid serious air pollution problems linked to the growing
numbers of automobiles on their roads. The regulations in the markets of relevance for our business are
presented below.

**_Europe_**

Emission of pollutant substances is regulated separately for light vehicles and heavy duty vehicles.

_Light Vehicles_

EU emission regulations for new light vehicles were once specified in Directive 70/220/EEC with a number
of amendments adopted through 2004. The standards that were defined by the directives are known as
Euro 1, Euro 2, Euro 3 and Euro 4. In 2007, this directive has been repealed and replaced by
Regulation 715/2007/EC which defined the standards Euro 5 and Euro 6. The Euro 5 standard came into
force in September 2009 for the approval of new types of passenger cars from that date on, and applies for
the registration of new passenger cars since January 2011. Since January 2012 it also applies for all light
commercial vehicles and special needs cars. The Euro 5 standard restricts emissions, from both diesel and
petrol vehicles. According to Euro 5, diesel vehicles are allowed to emit 500 mg/km of CO, 5 mg/km of PM,
180 mg/km of NOx and 230 mg/km of combined emissions of HC and NOx. Petrol vehicles (or vehicles
running on NG or LPG) are allowed to emit 1,000 mg/km of CO, 68 mg/km of non-methane HC,
100 mg/km of total HC, 60 mg/km of NOx and, only for lean burn direct-injection petrol vehicles, 5 mg/km
of PM. The Euro 6 standard will come into force in September 2014 for the approval of new types of
passenger cars from that date on, and shall apply for the registration of new passenger cars as of January
2015. As of January 2016, the Euro 6 standard will then also be compulsory for all light commercial
vehicles and special needs cars. The Euro 6 standard will set significantly lower emission limits for NOx
emissions from diesel cars. According to Euro 6, diesel vehicles are allowed to emit only 80 mg/km of NOx
and 170 mg/km of combined emissions of HC and NOx.

_Heavy Duty Vehicles_

European emission regulations for new heavy vehicles are commonly referred to as Euro 1 to Euro 6. The
emission standards apply to all motor vehicles with a ‘‘technically permissible maximum laden mass’’ of
over 3,500 kg, equipped with compression ignition diesel engines or positive ignition NG or LPG engines.
Directive 2005/55/EC and its implementing Directive 2005/78/EC set the emission limits for Euro 5.
According to Euro 5, heavy duty vehicles are allowed to emit 1,500 mg/kWh of CO, 460 mg/kWh of HC,
2,000 mg/kWh of NOx and 20 mg/kWh of PM. Directive 2005/55/EC will be repealed by
Regulation 595/2009/EC with effect from December 31, 2013, which will establish the stricter emission
limit Euro VI. While the limit for CO will remain unchanged, the limit value for HC will be 130 mg/kWh,
the NOx limit will be 400 mg/kWh and the limit for PM will be 10 mg/kWh.

**_United States_**

In the United States, there are two main sets of emission standards, the federal standards set by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (‘‘EPA’’) and the standards set by the CARB. Pursuant to the
federal Clean Air Act, California is permitted to request and has received a waiver from the EPA to
develop its own emission regulations for certain regulated pollutants. Other states that do not meet
National Ambient Air Quality Standards are permitted to implement relevant California standards for
current or future model years instead of the federal emissions standards, provided that the relevant state
must adopt California’s motor vehicle emissions standards no later than two years before the affected
model year.

_Federal Standards_

Under the current Tier 2 regulations promulgated by the EPA, the same emission standards apply to all
weight categories of light vehicles. The Tier 2 emission standards are set out in the form of 11 certification
levels or ‘‘bins’’ (8 permanent and 3 temporary, which expired in 2008), which set out different emission
targets according to pollutant. Each bin has a varying level of stringency, and manufacturers may obtain
certification of their vehicles from the EPA according to any of these bins, provided that the average NOx
emission level for the manufacturer’s entire fleet not exceed 0.07 g/mile. The EPA is currently developing
more stringent requirements which are expected to phase in with the 2017 model year. Heavy duty vehicles
are also subject to stringent emissions requirements which were recently tightened with regard to the 2010
model year.

_California Standards_

CARB has issued its own set of emission standards for low emission vehicles (or LEV). California’s LEV II
regulations impose stringent emissions requirements. Currently, fourteen states have adopted the
California standards for current and / or future model years. In January 2012, CARB approved the
California Advanced Clean Cars Program, including proposed LEV III regulations that will be phased in

77


-----

through model years 2015-2025. The LEV III regulations, among other things, set standards for
greenhouse gases (discussed below) and smog-forming pollutants, including a 75% reduction in
smog-forming emissions from new vehicles by 2025 (compared to 2014 levels).

**_Brazil_**

Brazil’s engine emission standards are based mainly on relevant European legislation. In 2009, the
PROCONVE L5 standards, which are based on the Euro 4 standards, were introduced for new light
vehicles. The newer PROCONVE L6 standards, which are based on Euro 5 regulations, are intended to
come into force between 2013 and 2015. The PROCONVE P5 standards, which are based on the Euro III
standards, were introduced in January 2006 for new heavy duty vehicles. Originally the Brazilian
government planned to introduce more stringent PROCONVE P6 standards in January 2009, based on
Euro IV regulations, but these standards were never implemented due to the unavailability of low sulphur
diesel. Nonetheless, the new PROCONVE P7 standards, based on Euro 5 standards, came into force in
January 2012.

**_China_**

China’s engine emission standards are based mainly on relevant European legislation and typically are
introduced gradually, by region, before being launched nationwide. They are set by the Chinese MEP. The
current emission standards for light vehicles, which are based on Euro 4 regulations, were initially
introduced in the Beijing region in January 2007, before eventually coming into force nationwide in July
2010. The China IV regulations, based on the Euro 4 regulations, were originally meant to be introduced
in January 2010 for new models and in January 2011 for existing models, but were delayed by one year due
to the unavailability of low sulphur diesel, which was necessary in order to implement the reduced emission
technology required to meet China IV standards. Due to continuing fuel quality issues, MEP further
delayed the implementation of China IV standards from January 2012 to July 2013. The China IV
standards were introduced earlier in the Beijing region, with adoption of regulations taking place in
January 2008.

**BUSINESS**

**Our company**

We are a leading global automotive supplier active in the design, development and manufacture of metal
components and assemblies for sale to OEMs, primarily for use in the production of light vehicles. We
have an extensive global footprint of 94 production facilities in 19 countries over four continents with four
additional plants under construction as of December 31, 2012. We supply our products globally to all of the
12 largest OEMs by production volume. Our extensive geographical and customer diversification allows us
to take advantage of global growth opportunities and has mitigated the impact of regional production
fluctuations on our business during economic downturns.

We offer our OEM customers a diverse product portfolio, supplying Body-in-White and Chassis structures
and complex assemblies, Mechanisms, as well as tooling and dies and other related services.

- _Body-in-White: Our Body-in-White product portfolio includes large component parts and assemblies,_
such as hoods, roofs, doors, fenders and other high quality ‘‘Class A’’ surfaces and assemblies, which
are used to create the exterior skin of an automobile. This product portfolio also includes structural
and other crash-relevant products, such as floors, pillars, rails and wheel arches, which together with
the exterior skin component parts and assemblies form the essential upper and under body (platform)
structures of an automobile.

- _Chassis: Our Chassis product portfolio consists of systems, frames and related parts, such as front and_
rear axles and links, control arms and integrated links, which link the body and the powertrain of an
automobile and carry the load of the vehicle.

- _Mechanisms: Our Mechanisms product portfolio consists of mechanical components such as hinges_
for doors, hoods, and trunk lids, door checks and door hinges with integrated door checks that join the
automobile’s body with the moving parts and that enable the user to open and shut the automobile’s
front, side and rear doors and lift-gates. Mechanisms also include powered systems that allow
automobile doors to open and close electrically and by remote activation.

- _Other products (tooling): We have extensive in-house capabilities in the design, engineering,_
manufacturing and servicing of dies and tools in support of our customers and in-house press
manufacturing.

We believe that we are the number 1 supplier of Body-in-White and Chassis products globally by combined
revenue in 2011 as compared to the combined revenue of our two closest competitors for their
Body-in-White and Chassis products in 2011. In Mechanisms products, we believe that we are the clear
market leader among individual suppliers in Western and Eastern Europe combined, and in South
America, with estimated regional market shares of approximately 50% and 40%, respectively, by revenue
in 2011.

We are one of the very few truly global suppliers to OEMs in our product portfolio, which sets us apart
from many of our competitors in the industry. We have long-standing and entrenched relationships with
our largest OEM customers and, as a result, have been able to proactively manage our business to meet the
developing global trends in the industry and the resulting changes in the requirements of the OEMs that
we supply.

In 2012, our revenue was A5,757.3 million and our EBITDA was A620.1 million. During the same period,
we derived revenues of A4,748.3 million from our Body-in-White and Chassis sales, representing
approximately 82.5% of our total revenue and revenues of A682.3 million from our Mechanisms sales,
representing approximately 11.9% of our total revenue.

We believe that our historical and continuing financial and operational success and stability have been, and
continue to be, driven by our strategic, customer-focused geographical expansion and diversified revenue
streams, as well as our manufacturing, process design and technological expertise. We believe that these
factors have allowed us to achieve our position as a leading global supplier in the automotive industry, and
one of strategic importance to many of the largest OEMs globally.

**_Highly diversified revenue base across regions, customers and products_**

_Regional diversification_

We have a geographically highly diversified global footprint with 94 production facilities in 19 countries
over four continents with four additional plants under construction as of December 31, 2012. Since 2007,
we have focused our expansion outside our traditional markets in Western Europe, into North America,
South America, Asia and Eastern Europe where we have been able to capture the increasing demand for
our products, in part driven by a significant increase in vehicle production, particularly in the US, Mexico,
Brazil, China, India, Thailand, Turkey and Russia.

We are one of very few truly global players in our product portfolio who have committed substantial
investment to and have a well established presence in these growth markets. We are market leaders by
revenue in the majority of them, which gives us a competitive advantage over those suppliers who are yet to
establish themselves in these growing markets. For example, since 2007, when we had no production in
Asia, we have increased our revenues derived from our Asian operations to A460.6 million in 2012.

As part of our customer-focused approach to our expansion strategy, we have proactively managed the
decision of when and where to expand in our growth markets by coordinating our roll-out plans with those
of the OEMs we supply. In the past five years, we have opened 18 production facilities in our growth
markets, with four more under construction as of December 31, 2012. Our strong geographical
diversification throughout our regional centers of operation allows us to take advantage of global growth
opportunities and has mitigated the impact of regional demand fluctuations on our business during
economic downturns. The charts below reflect the evolution of our regional diversification between 2007
and 2012 by revenue:

_Customer diversification_

We have a well diversified customer base which, through a successful development strategy, has expanded
to include all of the 12 largest OEMs by production volume in 2012, as compared to seven of the largest
OEMs by production volume in 2007. In the financial year ended December 31, 2012, our top three OEM
customers accounted for 51.3% of our sales to OEMs (excluding tooling), compared to 60.3% in the
financial year ended December 31, 2007.

_Product diversification_

Our historic product portfolio has been comprised primarily of Body-in-White products and, to a lesser
extent, Chassis products. With the acquisition of the metal forming business unit of ThyssenKrupp Metal
Forming in 2011, we have significantly strengthened our position in Chassis products. Sales of our
Body-in-White and Chassis products represented 82.5% of our total revenues in 2012.

The acquisition in 2010 of the body components business unit of Edscha, a manufacturer of Mechanisms
products, enabled us to diversify our product portfolio by further increasing the range of products we can
offer our customers in the area of body and structural automotive components. Sales of our Mechanisms
products represented 11.9% of our total revenues in 2012. Our expansion into these product areas was in
line with our long-term growth strategy and strongly supported by our key OEM customers.

The diversification of our product portfolio has helped us to strengthen our strategic relationships with
OEMs, who are able to turn to us for innovative and market-leading product solutions across the value
chain.

**_Technology and leading R&D capabilities_**

One of the global trends in the automotive industry is the increased focus on innovative and
technologically advanced products that seek to address the parallel concerns of improved safety for
passengers and road users and weight and emissions reduction. Our commitment to developing innovative,
high quality products has defined our approach to our customers. We are a global leader in the automotive
supplier industry in the use of high strength and ultra high strength steel, which find their application in
many body parts of the car where it helps to reduce vehicle weight and improve fuel and emissions
efficiency while also improving safety in a cost-effective way. Many of our products are manufactured using
our state-of-the-art technologies in innovative press hardening (also known as hot stamping) and other
high strength stamping processes. These products provide superior safety and weight reduction,
differentiate us from our competition and help us to achieve leading positions in the industry. We have
made significant investments over the past three years in rolling out our press hardening and stamping
technology in our facilities around the world to respond to growing demand from OEMs for our products.

Our innovative products and market-leading processes are developed through our targeted R&D platform,
which has a dedicated team of approximately 1,000 employees, across 12 facilities spread around the globe.
Furthermore, we are among the very few Tier 1 suppliers that have in-house tooling capabilities.
Underlying our innovative products and processes and in-house capabilities is the maintenance of rigorous
quality management systems in all of our manufacturing plants and R&D facilities. Through regular
internal audits we are able to ensure that our products and processes are monitored to the highest industry

standards. We believe that these competencies and capabilities along the entire value chain give us a
competitive advantage over many of the other suppliers.

**_Leading market positions_**

We believe that we are the number 1 supplier of Body-in-White and Chassis products globally by combined
revenue in 2011 as compared to the combined revenue of our two closest competitors for their
Body-in-White and Chassis products in 2011. In Body-in-White products, we believe that we are the clear
market leader among individual suppliers in Western and Eastern Europe combined, and in South
America, with estimated regional market shares of approximately 31% and 22% respectively by revenue in
2011. In Chassis products, we believe that we are number two in the market among individual suppliers in
Western and Eastern Europe combined, and in South America, with estimated regional market shares of
approximately 24% and 25% respectively by revenue in 2011. Body-in-White, Chassis and Mechanisms
products collectively represented A5,430.6 million or 94.3% of our revenues in 2012.

In developing and rolling-out new models, OEMs are increasingly collaborating with suppliers to design
models around common platforms and are seeking to consolidate their supplier-base with an increased
focus on large, technically and financially strong global suppliers that are capable of producing consistent
and high-quality products at competitive prices. As a result, large, multi-technology, high-quality Tier 1
suppliers such as ourselves are increasingly taking market share from smaller competitors, as we are in a
better position to meet these OEM criteria.

We have strategic and long-standing relationships with our largest OEM customers, which are based on
confidence and an understanding established over many years of successful collaboration. There are very
few suppliers that, like us, have such long-standing relationships with the largest global OEMs, and there
are an even smaller number of suppliers that, like us, are capable of delivering solutions to complex
projects, truly globally and on a consistent and high quality basis across the product portfolios. Our scale
and ability to develop differentiated solutions for OEMs’ on a global footing are critical to our success and
differentiate us from local and regional suppliers of car components.

Our highly advanced technological capabilities, global manufacturing and managerial footprint, significant
operational scale and track record of financial stability enable us to be one of the very few suppliers who
can support an OEM throughout the full product life cycle, including as a development partner during the
early stages of product development. This ability to support the development process of OEMs and act as
an outsourcing partner to them globally is an important differentiator, especially on innovative product
solutions, and would take significant investment and many years to attempt to replicate.

From operational, technical and logistical perspectives, OEMs face substantial switching costs in replacing
the supplier of a particular component or platform, particularly during the life cycle of a specific vehicle
model, and the supplier of a particular car model is often also chosen for subsequent generations of that
model. This is largely due to the long lead-time and significant investment required to set up the
production and supply processes, and to the efficiencies and savings gained through experience with the
manufacturing processes of particular products.

Our long-standing and collaborative relationships with OEMs, highly advanced technological capabilities,
global manufacturing and managerial footprint, significant operational scale and track record of financial
stability help us to develop a competitive advantage over our competitors, entrench our strategic
relationships with OEMs and reduce the risk of a committed OEM switching from us to an alternative
supplier.

**_High mid-term revenue visibility, predictable cost-base and conservative financial risk profile_**

We have long-term and strategic relationships with our OEM customers. In our industry, once a project
has been nominated to a preferred supplier, it is rare for an OEM to switch to another supplier, given the
prohibitive operational, technical and logistical costs of switching, particularly during the life cycle of a
specific vehicle model. Given these factors, while the actual revenues which we derive from a project
ultimately depend on our OEM customers’ production volumes achieved for the respective car models, we
have good visibility of mid-term revenues within a relatively small range of sensitivity. Each year, most of
our revenues are derived from projects that continue into following years, given that vehicle cycles last
several years.

82


-----

In addition, our OEM customer, brand and model diversification, highly diversified global footprint and
our complementary product lines strongly mitigate the effects of regional demand or individual model
volume fluctuations and help to reduce mid-term revenue volatility.

We have a relatively predictable cost base, with limited maintenance capital expenditure once a project is
ongoing and limited exposure to raw material price volatility. The primary raw material used in our
business is steel, which in recent years represented approximately 50% of our sales. While steel prices
affect our revenue and costs, historically, our profit margins have not been significantly affected by changes
in steel prices. In 2012, over 60% of our steel was purchased through OEM re-sale programs, under which
an OEM customer negotiates directly with the steel suppliers the price of the steel that we use to
manufacture components for that OEM. Such negotiated steel price is passed through to the OEM
customer in the sale price of the automotive component. The remainder of our steel purchasing
requirements in 2012 was met through contracts with steel suppliers that we negotiated. Historically, we
have negotiated with our OEM customers to pass through the increase or decrease in the steel price,
eliminating significant volatility in our margins relating to volatility in steel prices. Due to our strong
relationships with OEMs and the large steel volumes we acquire in the market place, we expect to be able
to negotiate competitive steel contracts with suppliers and to pass through cost increases to our customers,
thus stabilizing the effect on our results.

In addition to our limited exposure to raw material price volatility, we have a low operating leverage, with
fixed costs accounting for less than 25% of our revenues in 2012. A significant part of our labor costs,
which have represented in recent years between approximately 15% and 17% of our total annual sales, are
semi-variable in nature and can be adjusted to meet business needs. For example, in 2008 and 2009, we
were able to respond quickly to the deterioration in market conditions and took measures to contain costs
by lowering headcount, including a reduction in the number of temporary personnel.

We have been able to keep our leverage ratios stable despite our sizeable acquisitions in 2010 (Edscha) and
in 2011 (ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming). We were able to continue to invest during the downturn and
maintain a high level of profitability by managing our working capital effectively, managing the timing of
capital expenditures and delivering cost savings across our business. Our predictable cost-base,
conservative financial profile and low operating leverage reduce the exposure of our operations to
unpredictable externalities and are valued by our OEM customers.

**_Experienced management team focused on operational excellence, profitable growth and stable shareholder_**
**_structure_**

Our management team has extensive experience in the industry and most of our executive committee have
been with the company for more than 10 years. Operational excellence is deeply rooted in our
organizational structure and culture. Our geographical divisions are focused on improving manufacturing
processes (built upon plant-by-plant profit centers), while our business units are centered on customers,
products, process innovation and R&D. Our focus on operational excellence across all of our production
and R&D facilities has established us as one of the technology, quality and innovation leaders in the
industry.

Our management team has a demonstrated track record of achieving long-term profitable growth through
the economic cycle, maintaining double-digit EBITDA margins even during the 2008-2009 economic crisis.
Our recent successful major acquisitions in 2010 (Edscha) and in 2011 (ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming)
were driven by our management’s identification of the substantial value creation potential of these
businesses.

Our controlling shareholders are long-term holders, supportive of our vision and strategy. Our Chief
Executive Officer, who is also one of our largest shareholders, has been instrumental in driving our
profitable growth strategy.

**Our strategies**

Our mission is to strive to be an indispensible strategic partner for a diversified OEM customer base across
our entire product portfolio. The strategies to achieve our mission, set out in more detail below, are
founded upon the pillars of best-in-class processes and product technology innovation, customer-focused
growth and diversification of our global footprint, while maintaining operational excellence at all levels and
in all regions.

83


-----

**_Retain and strengthen technological and quality leadership_**

Our objective is to leverage our operational economies of scale to provide our customers with a
best-in-class range of products that seek to address weight and emissions reduction targets, as well as
improved passenger and road user safety. We intend to continue to strengthen our technological
competencies to benefit from the trend towards co-development of new vehicles and common platforms
between OEMs and suppliers, while also growing our presence in innovative technologies. Our R&D
platform plays a key role in the development of new products, applications, technologies and processes,
and we intend to continue to invest to retain our technological leadership and respond to the latest
automotive industry trends.

**_Increase penetration with OEMs_**

Having significantly improved our worldwide customer penetration since the global financial crisis, we
believe that we are poised to benefit from the large number of new model roll-outs of our OEM customers.
We aim to increase our market share by winning new business across our global footprint. One of our key
focus areas for future growth is in deepening supply relationships with Japanese OEMs outside of Japan
(our sales to Japanese OEMs represented approximately 5% of our revenues in 2012 whereas their share
of global production of light vehicles in 2012 was approximately 22.4%). We see a trend of Japanese
OEMs shifting more of their production base outside of Japan to be closer to the markets with growing
demand for vehicles. In doing so, Japanese OEMs are more open to work with foreign suppliers. We
believe that our relationship with Mitsui through our joint venture in North and South America will
enhance our relationships with Japanese OEMs in general. We also intend to grow with other Asian
OEMs outside of their home markets.

**_Expand with discipline through selective and profitable investments_**

We aim to be an indispensable global partner for our OEM customers and we strive to achieve this aim by
continually proving our reliability as a strategic supplier by, for example, providing solutions to their most
critical needs on a global scale, and by continuing to tailor our expansion plans to match theirs.

Our capital expenditure is associated with disciplined growth, generally tied specifically to client project
nominations. Over the past five years we have opened 16 new manufacturing facilities in China, India,
Brazil, Russia, Turkey, Czech Republic, Korea and Argentina and we have also invested in two new
manufacturing facilities in the US, which have collectively added to our EBITDA and cash flow from
operating activities. While returns on investments are not guaranteed, in assessing a new investment, as
part of our internal decision making methodology, one of the factors our management considers is whether
we believe that the investment may result in an internal rate of return to us of at least 15%.

This selective and disciplined approach to investments has significantly contributed to our increase in
EBITDA from A390.0 million in 2010 to A620.1 million in 2012 and to our increase in cash flows from
operating activities from A271.2 million in 2010 to A371.5 million in 2012. Although, we have favored
organic growth over acquisitions, through our strategic acquisitions of Edscha (2010) and ThyssenKrupp
Metal Forming (2011), we have participated in the consolidation and rationalization of the supplier base in
collaboration with OEMs.

We aim to continue this approach of disciplined investments. Currently the primary focus, both for our
OEM customers and for us, is on growth markets where there are opportunities to capitalize on growing
long-term demand relative to that of the mature economies. For instance, we believe that we are
well-positioned to take advantage of China’s growth as a result of our existing footprint of high-quality
manufacturing facilities in the country. Three out of our four additional plants that are currently under
construction are located in China to meet non-Chinese OEMs’ local needs. There currently is substantial
demand for our products in growth markets that would require additional manufacturing facilities and we
aim to take advantage of this demand through selective and disciplined investments.

**_Maintain and bring improved operational excellence to bear on existing and acquired businesses_**

Our objective is to deliver a best-in-class range of products to our OEM customers and, to this end, we
strive to maintain an organizational structure and culture with consistent levels of operational excellence
across all of our production and R&D facilities.

At the same time, we focus on reducing our cost base through improved economies of scale and
capitalizing on synergies with recently acquired businesses. Over the past five years, we have delivered

84


-----

double-digit EBITDA margins in our existing businesses and have a track record of improving EBITDA
margins in acquired businesses as we adapt them to our best-in-class manufacturing techniques and
processes.

**_Evaluate regional partnerships in new markets_**

We continually evaluate working with regional strategic partners when entering new markets in order to
limit start-up risks and benefit from partners’ intimate knowledge of local requirements and customers’
needs. Two examples of such joint ventures are our operations in Turkey, with Bey¸celik, and in Russia, with
Severstal. We also have financial partners in some joint ventures with the aim to mitigate the financial costs
of entering new markets. We have recently announced a joint venture with Mitsui which we expect will
bring both financial and strategic benefits. If opportunities arise in the future, we will evaluate suitable
partnerships strategically aligned from a customer, technological, geographic and/or financial perspective.

**Our Products**

We produce a diverse range of products, many of which are critical to the structural integrity of a vehicle.
Our product portfolio covers Body-in-White and Chassis structures and complex assemblies, opening
systems and Mechanisms, as well as tooling and other services. We focus on innovation in the design of our
products with the fundamental goals of promoting weight reduction, therefore reducing harmful emissions
and environmental impact; and improving safety, thereby increasing the protection of passengers, other
road users and pedestrians.

_Body-in-White and Chassis_

Body-in-White

Our Body-in-White product lines are comprised of component parts and assemblies, such as hoods, roofs,
doors, fenders and other Class A surfaces and assemblies, which are used to create the ‘‘exterior skin’’ of
the vehicle. Because these component parts and assemblies form the visible exterior of the vehicle and
therefore its outward appearance, they require consistent and flawless surface finishes. This product line
also consists of structural and other crash-relevant products, such as floors, pillars, rails and wheel arches,
which together with the ‘‘exterior skin’’ component parts and assemblies, form the essential structure of the
vehicle.

Our Body-in-White product lines consist of both component parts, as well as the complex assemblies which
are made up of multiple component parts and sub-assemblies welded together to form major portions of
the vehicle’s body structure.

Chassis

Our Chassis product lines are comprised of systems, frames and related parts, such as front and rear axles
and links, control arms and integrated links, which are used to create the ‘‘skeleton’’, or essential lower
body structure, of the vehicle and carry the load of the vehicle. These structures are critical to overall
performance of the vehicle, particularly in the areas of noise, vibration and harshness, handling and crash
management. Chassis structures include heavy gauge metal stampings that provide structural integrity in

The primary technologies and processes involved in the manufacturing of our Mechanisms products
include, among other things, stamping, sawing, milling and plastic injection molding. See
‘‘—Manufacturing processes’’.

Other products (tooling)

We have extensive in-house capabilities in the design, engineering, manufacturing and servicing of dies and
tools in support of our customers. We also have in-house press manufacturing services. Additionally, we
provide engineering support services, independent of particular production programs. See
‘‘—Manufacturing processes’’.

In addition, we typically sell the scrap steel that is generated by our manufacturing processes in secondary
markets, the revenue from which is allocated between our Body-in-White, Chassis and Mechanisms
products lines according to where the scrap was derived. We generally share our recoveries from sales of
scrap steel with our customers either through scrap sharing agreements, in cases where we are on resale
programs, or in the product pricing that is negotiated regarding increases and decreases in the steel price
in cases where we purchase steel directly from the mills.

**Manufacturing processes**

Since our foundation in 1997 we, and the technology employed in our manufacturing processes, have
evolved significantly from a limited-technology company based only on cold stamping, to a multitechnology company with diversified technological capabilities. We now have a broad technology portfolio
and capabilities across the value chain, including (i) in-house die/tool manufacturing capabilities; (ii) a
wide range of forming technologies from press hardening to cold forming technologies such as roll-forming
and hydro-forming, in addition to the full range of cold stamping processes; (iii) advanced assembly

technologies such as remote laser welding; and (iv) finishing technologies such as powder coating and
cataphoretic painting.

_Die or tool manufacturing_

Dies or tools are the common terms for the equipment used in the stamping and forming processes to cut
or form raw material into a required shape using a press. Our in-house tooling capabilities cover the entire
tooling value chain from the initial process of die design to the secondary phase of prototyping, patterning,
casting, machining and setting the die through to try-out verification, quality checks and logistics. We are
recognized as one of the few suppliers that have in-house tooling capabilities that can address the
manufacture of parts that comprise the visible outer skin of the car (also called A-class parts) such as doors
and hoods. Critical phases such as follow-ups and quality checks are carried out globally by a dedicated
European team. We have a supplier development program in place to assure the quality of any outsourced
tooling. Our customers recognize us as one of the few suppliers that have the internal capacities for
developing and manufacturing tooling for press hardening.

_Forming_

Press Hardening or Hot Stamping

Press Hardening is an innovative process by which advanced ultra high strength steel is formed into
complex shapes more efficiently than with traditional cold stamping. The process involves the heating of
the steel blanks until they are malleable, followed by formation and then rapid cooling in specially
designed dies, creating in the process a transformed and hardened material. Because of this ability to
efficiently combine strength and complexity, press hardened parts accomplish in one relatively light-weight
piece what would typically require thicker, heavier parts welded together in more than one process under
cold stamping. Press hardening parts therefore currently represent one of the most advanced lightweight
solutions for the car body structure that simultaneously allows us to improve crash performance and
passenger safety requirements.

Set out below is a graphic description of the basic process of press hardening.

8MAY201304430966

The press hardening process is comprised of four main steps. First, sheets of material are cut into blank
units by a blanking line. The blanks are then loaded into an automatic furnace and heated over a defined
period of time to 930�C. After the heating process is complete, they are transferred into a press.
Immediately upon transfer into the press, the material is stamped to a complex shape while being cooled at
a minimum cooling rate of 50�c per second while inside the die. The newly produced part has an ultra-high
strength of 1500 Mpa, as opposed to ca. 550 Mpa with cold stamped boron steel. Following this process,
the produce part needs to be cut and pierced using a laser.

We are the largest global supplier of press hardening parts. As of December 31, 2012 we had 41 press
hardening production lines installed globally, with a further six to be installed by the end of 2013 and a
further eight estimated to be installed by the end of 2014. Our press hardening production lines cover the
entire value chain from the manufacturing of our own dies to production lines.

The close cooperation between our R&D and process know-how has resulted in the creation of a highly
sophisticated and patented ‘‘Tailored Material Property’’ or ‘‘TMP’’ design. TMP is a specific press
hardening process with which we can produce different strength levels in different areas of the same part,
using the same equipment inside the dies but controlling the different hardening temperatures during the
cooling process. Press hardening using the TMP design process is changing the car body architecture.
TMP technology, creating deformable soft zones, allows us to provide new product offerings that provide

87


8MAY201304430966


-----

better crash behavior and controlled car body deformation than other products. Using the TMP design
process, we are also able to achieve up to 20% weight reduction when compared with other products made
using traditional methods.

8MAY201304434213

_Cold Forming_

Cold forming technologies include forming operations in different types of machines. Sub-categories of
cold forming include roll forming and hydro-forming. Cold forming allows us to manufacture a range of
parts from small reinforcement parts to a complete car body side.

Cold forming involves the transformation of a sheet of metal at room temperature inside a forming die
under pressure. We operate various kinds of cold forming presses with different automation concepts with
press forces ranging from 200 tons up to 2,500 tons. In order to achieve complex forms, parts must be
pressed or stamped and cut in several steps, under different press technologies. Depending on the size and
shape of the part we can choose the press process operations used to stamp the parts. For instance:

- For large parts, we use tandem presses where the material is moved by robots from press to press in
five or six operations.

- For medium size parts with cupped shapes, we use transfer presses, where the material is moved inside
the die by transfer bars in up to six operations. During the transfer press stamping process steel coil
sheet is fed into a press and a blank is created where the material is cut from the coil strip. The blank
is then pushed or transferred to the next station where the rough cup is created. The cup is then
transferred by mechanical fingers to one or more subsequent draw stations until the rough, final shape
has been created. The part is then transferred into additional stations that are used to establish critical
diameters and lengths, features, and forms.

- For small size parts, we use progressive presses, where the material is always connected with the
stamped part in the material strip and the finished part is separated from the strip after several
forming and cutting operations. Progressive presses are mainly used for some deep draw stamping
where the length to diameter ratio is low and part side features are not required. In progressive
presses, the steel coil sheet is not cut, but is fed through the press. After several forming and cutting
operations, and only once finished, the stamped part is separated from the material strip.

We operate presses in the upper range of forces of greater than 1,000 tons and consequently we are able to
stamp high strength materials, which have a typical strength up to 1,000 MPa. Ultra high strength steels are
an important part of weight reduction solutions for the car body structure and have a significant impact
especially in the car chassis where material thickness and strengths are required.

Roll Forming is a cold forming process, where a coil strip is subjected to a bending operation by passing the
strip through sets of rollers resulting in continuous deformation. Each set of rollers performs an
incremental part of the bend, until the desired cross-section profile is obtained. This process is ideal for
producing parts with constant profiles, long lengths and in large quantities. We operate several variations
of roll forming and can also perform automatic cutting, piercing, separating and laser welding. With this
range of capabilities we can manufacture parts with minimum material usage.

Hydroforming is a specialized type of cold forming that uses a high pressure hydraulic fluid to press room
temperature tubes into a die. The process consists of pre-bending a metallic tube and placing this
pre-shaped tube inside a die with the desired cross sections and forms, and applying pressure to the inside
of the tube held by the die. During the blowing or forming of the tube held in the die, holes can be pierced

88


8MAY201304434213


-----

into the tube thereby avoiding secondary operations in most cases. Hydroforming allows complex shapes
with concavities to be formed, which would be difficult or impossible with standard stamping.
Hydroforming is considered to be a cost-effective way of shaping metal into lightweight, structurally stiff,
complex and strong pieces. One of the advantages of using this process is that it enables us to create a
three dimensional tube that in cold stamping only could be manufactured by welding two shells together.
The ability to deform thick materials makes this technology useful for chassis applications in particular.

_Assembly_

During the assembly stage, we effectively combine components of all our different manufacturing
processes using welding, clinching and adhesive technologies. Our body shops use the most advanced
technologies for assembling complex parts such as complete chassis and engine cradles using advanced
assembly technologies such as metal inert gas (MIG) welding or metal active gas (MAG) welding. We use
parts resistant or spot welding in the welding of Ultra High Strength Steel and Press Hardening parts. Our
welding cells are typically highly automated and we use automated robots to perform several of the most
precise operations inside the welding cells to achieve maximum cost reduction and ensure we produce the
highest quality assemblies.

We use a special process of laser welding in all the different aspects of our production. For instance, the
Tailor Welded Blank process involves the welding of two flat metal blanks, thereby creating a single
product with different thicknesses or comprising several different types of materials. TWB products are
important in the weight reduction of the car body structure and can be combined with any types of material
for cold forming and press hardening.

Laser welding technology is not limited to flat material welding and is used also to weld different parts into
an assembly. The advantages of laser welding are the very short time cycles and minimal deformation due
to the reduced thermic effect.

_Finishing_

We use various finishing technologies such as shot blasting, zinc coating, powder coating and cataphoretic
painting on our products. Shot blasting is used to clean surfaces such as uncoated steels, mainly in press
hardening and to prepare parts for welding and painting. Zinc coating is used for maximum corrosion
protection and is applied to chassis components. Powder coating and painting operations are the basis for
any assembly for normal corrosion requirements. Finishing is always a fully automated process so as to
guarantee the highest quality finish and to meet pre-agreed product specifications and requirements.

_Processes specifically used in our Mechanisms segment_

Hinges are made of three different raw materials with different manufacturing processes. We may use
sheet metal and use a stamping process in progressive dies. We may also use other raw materials such as
profiles, which are first sawn and then finely milled and profiled by automated milling centers. The
manufacture of hinges involves partial zinc coating and the final assembly on specific assembly-lines with
screwing and riveting processes. The manufacture of door checks involves plastic injection molding. The
manufacture of driver controls may additionally involve cataphoretic painting. Powered systems production
is mainly based on the assembly of purchased electrical and mechanical components on customized
assembly lines.

**Research and Development**

We operate in a highly competitive and globalized industry and must constantly change and adapt to meet
our customer’s needs and expectations. We consider innovation and R&D to be key success factors for the
differentiation of our products and services from those of our competitors. Among our global workforce of
30,313 as at December 31, 2012, approximately 1,000 employees are focused on R&D.

Our Body-in-White and Chassis products are fundamental elements in the vehicles produced by our OEM
customers. The design and manufacture of these products are driven by the requirements and expectations
of the OEMs that we supply, and we collaborate and work closely with them, from the early stages of
development through to final production, to ensure their requirements and expectations are met.

When conceiving of, designing and producing our Body-in-White products, we collaborate with the OEMs
to focus on improving the fundamental, strategic functions of the vehicle such as sustainability (including
lightweight design; use of eco-friendly technologies), passive safety (EuroNCAP and IIHS), NVH, exterior

89


-----

styling (which is a non-technical but esthetic consideration) and architecture (involving support to all the
functions and modules of the vehicle), durability and fatigue. We seek to create close collaborations with
our clients in order to co-develop body-in-white concepts and technologies for the future. In Chassis, our
R&D efforts are geared towards achieving weight reduction. In Mechanisms, we look to address daily
challenges such as vehicle access, crash safety and reliability. Across our product lines, cost effective design
is a key area of strategic focus of our innovation efforts.

Our past R&D activities have resulted in a number of new proprietary manufacturing processes and
products including, for example, the TMP design technology described above, which enables us to create
specifically targeted material properties in precision-targeted areas of the part and which allows our clients
to optimize weight and performance. See ‘‘—Manufacturing processes’’.

While we manufacture a small number of products using aluminum and carbon-fiber, demand in the
market for aluminum and carbon-fiber based products is limited at present, primarily due to the high costs
in relation to performance and weight savings. Nevertheless, we monitor the evolution of demand in the
market for premium products constructed using these materials, and our customer-focused strategy may
lead us to manufacture more products with these materials, based on customer demand and potential for
adequate returns for us.

Our close working relationships with the OEMs results in a deep understanding of our customers’
requirements and constraints. This major advantage enables us to provide innovative, customized and cost
effective products that address their needs and which consolidates our relationship with them as a core
supplier and co-developer of strategic importance.

**Intellectual Property**

Although the processes we use in the manufacture of the products we produce are technical in nature, our
business does not rely heavily on intellectual property. Among the most important intellectual property
that we do own relate to the patented press hardening processes we utilise in our operations, as well as our
brand name, Gestamp.

**Customers and Geography**

We have a broad customer base as well as an extensive global manufacturing and managerial footprint. In
the last five years to December 31, 2012, we have increasingly diversified our customer base to an extent
that we now sell our products to each of the top 12 OEMs by production volume, including Volkswagen,
Renault-Nissan, BMW, General Motors and Daimler.

We have developed long-standing business relationships with our automotive customers around the world.
We work together with our customers along the full value chain, including development, industrial
engineering, tooling and manufacturing. Quality assurance programs matching the highest standards
underlie our service offering. In growing economies in particular, our customers are focusing their own
resources on vehicle assembly and seek to outsource to suppliers that are capable of providing an
integrated supply service. We believe that our customers perceive us as a supplier that is capable on a
global scale of providing: 1) high-quality products at competitive prices with standardized high-level
quality; 2) innovative solutions for complex projects; and 3) on-time delivery and quality customer service.
Our technical expertise and extensive global footprint have enabled us to win complex mandates on global
projects with the top OEMs around the globe including, for example:

- Volkswagen—PQ25 platform, manufactured in Spain, Germany, the Czech Republic, Brazil, Russia
and India;

- General Motors—Delta platform, manufactured in the UK, Russia, Poland, Germany, the US and
Korea; and

- BMW—L7 & L6 (BMW 3-& 5-series) platform, manufactured in China and the US.

Mandates in the automotive OEM business involve long-term production arrangements based on the
lifecycle of the specific model or platform. As a result of our strategic and long term relationships with our
OEM customers, and given the prohibitive operational, technical and logistical costs of switching,
particularly during the life cycle of a specific vehicle model, we have strong visibility on our mid-term
revenues. Furthermore, we believe we can leverage our strong customer relationships to obtain similar
awards in the future.

90


-----

In addition to being diversified, our customer base is weighted towards financially stable OEMs, meaning
that, subject to the stage of the automotive industry cycle and prevailing macroeconomic conditions, our
revenue streams are relatively secure.

Our geographical diversification strategy is aligned with the ongoing expansion by OEMs into growth
economies and the consolidation of their existing presence in established markets. As OEMs have sought
to establish presence in growth markets and to grow outside of their home markets, we have adapted our
geographical diversification strategy to focus less on our presence in Western Europe, which is well
established, and more on these growing markets.

While we continue to pursue a measured strategy of geographical diversification, the basis of our
technological expertise continues to be Western Europe. Our acquisition of ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming,
while having the effect of returning weight back to our Western European sales contribution, brought us
important technical expertise, particularly with regard to chassis design and development.

**Suppliers**

We purchase various manufactured components and raw materials for use in our manufacturing processes.
All of these components and raw materials are available from numerous sources. We employ just-in-time
manufacturing and sourcing systems enabling us to meet customer requirements for faster deliveries while
minimizing our need to carry significant inventory levels.

The primary raw material used in our business is steel, which in recent years represented approximately
50% of our sales. In 2012, over 60% of our steel was purchased through OEM re-sale programs, under
which an OEM customer negotiates the price of the steel that we use to manufacture components for such
OEMs directly with the steel suppliers. Such negotiated steel price is passed through to the OEM customer
in the sale price of the automotive component. The remainder of our steel purchasing requirements in
2012 was met through contracts with steel suppliers that we negotiated. Historically, we have negotiated
with our OEM customers to pass through the increase or decrease in the steel price, eliminating significant
volatility in our cost base relating to volatility in steel prices. Due to our strong relationships with
OEMs and the large steel volumes we acquire in the market place, we expect to be able negotiate
competitive steel contracts from suppliers and to pass through cost increases to our customers, thus
stabilizing the effect on our results.

**Competitive landscape**

**_Overview_**

We develop, manufacture and market different components, modules and system solutions included in the
vehicle’s body and structural system. The body and structural market consists of various product groups
and is therefore split into many sub-markets. Consequently, our competitive position differs among the
various sub- markets. Broadly speaking, we are one of the few players in body and structural parts to offer
OEMs a truly global manufacturing footprint. Our key competitors with a similar global offering are
Benteler, Magna International, Inc. (Cosma division) (‘‘Magna’’) and, to a somewhat lesser extent, Tower
International LLC (‘‘Tower’’).

The market positions stated below are based on management’s assessment.

**_Competitive landscape for Body-in-White_**

The competitive landscape for Body-in-White varies significantly by region. Western and Eastern Europe,
North America and South America are relatively highly consolidated, while the Asian market is highly
fragmented. We believe that we are the clear market leader among individual suppliers in Western and
Eastern Europe combined, with an estimated regional market share of approximately 31% by revenue in
2011, with a regional market share of more than double that of our closest competitor. Our main
competitors in Western and Eastern Europe are Benteler, Magna, Magnetto-Unipres and Kirchoff. In the
North American market, we are within the top four individual players, with Magna being the market
leader, and Benteler and Martinrea being the other key competitors. In South America, we are the market
leader with a market share of approximately 22% by revenue in 2011, with Aethra, Delga, MagnettoUnipres and Tower International being our key competitors. In this region, local players tend to be strong
competitors; however, we believe that we differentiate our offering through superior technological
know-how. In Asia, it is difficult to estimate our regional market position with any accuracy, as competitive
dynamics can vary significantly by country. In Japan and Korea, a significant proportion of parts are

91


-----

outsourced to companies that traditionally have close links to domestic OEMs, with local
OEMs sometimes being the only major customer of the respective suppliers. In China, domestic
OEMs still mostly work with domestic suppliers in body and structural components; therefore, our
exposure to the Chinese market is primarily through supplying foreign OEMs.

**_Competitive landscape for chassis_**

Market concentration dynamics for chassis are similar to Body-in-White, with Western and Eastern
Europe, North America and South America being somewhat highly consolidated, while the Asian market
remains fragmented. We believe that we are number two in the market by individual suppliers in Western
and Eastern Europe combined, and in South America, with estimated regional market shares of
approximately 24% and 25% respectively by revenue in 2011, with Benteler being the market leader in
Western and Eastern Europe and Magna being the market leader in South America. The North American
market in particular exhibits very high concentration, with Benteler, Magna, Martinrea, Metalsa and Tower
International holding substantial market shares. We do not have a significant presence in chassis in North
America. In the Asian market, domestic suppliers such as Hyundai Mobis and Yorozu have significant
market shares, with Benteler, Magna and Tower International being the leading international competitors.
Our presence in the Asian market is still relatively small and is focused on working with foreign OEMs in
the region. The local trends in Chassis are similar to those described for Body-in-White in Asia,

**_Competitive landscape for hinges and mechanisms_**

We believe that we are the clear market leader by individual suppliers in Western and Eastern Europe
combined, and in South America, with estimated regional market shares of approximately 50% and 40%,
respectively, by revenue in 2011; a significantly higher market share than any of our competitors. Our key
competitors in Western and Eastern Europe are ISE Automotive Group and Multimatic Inc.
(‘‘Multimatic’’). We do not have any individual significant competitors in South America, and compete
against a range of players with substantially lower market shares in the region; including AISIN
SEIKI Co. Ltd. (‘‘AISIN’’), Flex-N-Gate Plastics Group (‘‘Flex’’), Midway Products and Mitsui Kinzoku
AC. We are relatively small players in North America and medium-sized players in Asia, where it is
difficult to estimate our market position with any accuracy.

**_Key customer criteria for purchasing decisions_**

We believe that our customers choose between different suppliers based largely on the following criteria:

- Price competitiveness

- Product quality

- Ability to manage complex projects

- R&D competencies

- Process technology competencies

- Tooling competencies across the value chain

- Breadth of geographical manufacturing footprint

- Financial stability

- Partnership in consolidation/rationalization of the global automotive supplier base

We principally compete for new business both at the beginning of the development of new models and
upon the redesign of existing models. Once a supplier has been designated to supply parts for a new
program, an OEM usually will continue to purchase those parts from the designated producer for the life
of the program, although not necessarily for a redesign. OEMs typically rigorously evaluate suppliers based
on many criteria such as quality, price/cost competitiveness, system and product performance, reliability
and timeliness of delivery, new product and technology development capability, excellence and flexibility in
operations, degree of global and local presence, effectiveness of customer service and overall management
capability.

We believe that we compete effectively with other leading suppliers in our market. The strength and
breadth of our program management and engineering capabilities, as well as our geographic, customer and
product diversification, provide the necessary scale to be cost and quality competitive. We follow

92


-----

manufacturing practices designed to improve efficiency and quality so that we can deliver quality
components and systems to our customers in the quantities and at the times ordered.

Although there are many players in the global automotive industry, in the areas of the industry in which we
operate, there are very few global competitors, as the financial and logistical constraints inherent in
establishing and maintaining a true global presence are quite high. Our major competitors include
Benteler, Magna and Tower in Body-in-White and Chassis and Flex, AISIN and Multimatic in
Mechanisms. We compete with other companies with respect to certain of our products and in particular
geographic markets. The number of our competitors has decreased in recent years and we believe will
continue to decline due to continued supplier consolidation and the recent economic downturn. We expect
that OEMs will continue to be increasingly focused on the financial strength and viability of their supply
base. We believe that such scrutiny of suppliers will result in additional contraction in the supplier base and
may force combinations of some suppliers.

**Joint ventures**

_Mitsui Investment in our American Operations_

On January 4, 2013 we entered into an investment agreement with Mitsui according to which Mitsui will
acquire a 30% minority stake in our operations in North and South America by investing A297.0 million in
newly issued shares of Gestamp North America, Inc., Gestamp 2015, S.L., Gestamp 2016, S.L. and
Gestamp Brasil Ind´ustria de Autope¸cas, S.A. (collectively the ‘‘Holdcos’’), our US, Mexican, Argentine
and Brazilian sub-holding companies, respectively. The completion of the Mitsui Investment is subject to
the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including obtaining certain regulatory approvals and our
acquisition of the 35% interest in our Mexican subsidiaries currently owned by Cofides. We have agreed to
acquire this stake from Cofides, and we expect to close this repurchase before the end of June 2013. We
have entered into a shareholders’ agreement with Mitsui on January 4, 2013 to govern the terms of the
Mitsui Investment and promote the efficient management of each of the Holdcos. The governance
structure reflects our majority holding, with certain reserved matters on which both we and Mitsui must
agree.

Each Holdco is required to fund its operations in any calendar year such that 20% of related capital costs
are financed by debt and 80% are financed by retained earnings or capital contributions. The shareholders’
agreement also contains certain restrictions on guarantees being given by any of the Holdcos or their
respective subsidiaries for obligations of Gestamp Automoci´on and its affiliates. Subject to cash and
working capital needs and certain additional obligations, the joint venture’s policy would be that the
Holdcos would declare and pay dividends which, on an aggregate annual basis, amount to the lesser of
(i) 60% of the Holdcos’ net profit; and (ii) the maximum amount permitted to be distributed under
applicable law.

Each of the shareholders is subject to a three year lock-up period during which time they are, subject to
limited exceptions, restricted from taking certain actions as regards the shares they hold in the Holdcos
including, but not limited to, selling, pledging or otherwise disposing of their shares. After the lock-up
period and subject to certain restrictions as regards transfers to competitors, the shareholders’ agreement
includes standard exit provisions including rights of last refusal, a tag-along right for Mitsui and a
drag-along right for us. The shareholders’ agreement also includes typical put options, both for us and for
Mitsui on a change of control and, following a material default under the shareholders’ agreement; a call
option for us (where Mitsui is the defaulting party) and a put option for Mitsui (where we are the
defaulting party). The shareholders’ agreement also contains certain non-compete restrictions on Mitsui.

Our other joint ventures include:

_Liberty Investment in GMF Holding._

-----

sale, if the sale price realized by Tocqueville is lower than A104.0 million, then we will be obliged to pay
Soci´et´e G´en´erale, which in turn will be obliged to pay Tocqueville, an amount such that Tocqueville would
receive an aggregate amount of A104.0 million for its shares. Under the terms of the Soci´et´e G´en´erale
Guaranteed Back-up Facility Agreement, in the event that Tocqueville receives an amount of less than
A104.0 million in the sale of its shares in GMF Holding to a third party, Soci´et´e G´en´erale has agreed to
make available to Gestamp Metalbages, S.A. a term loan facility up to A104.0 million. The Soci´et´e
G´en´erale Guaranteed Back-up facility Agreement terminates on September 5, 2013.

_Severstal_

On October 2008 our subsidiary Gestamp Levante, S.L. signed a shareholders agreement with the Russian
steel manufacturer JSC Severstal and its subsidiary Severstal Trade GesmbH, pursuant to which Gestamp
incorporated a joint venture company in Spain, Todlem, S.L., which is the holding company of two
operative companies in Russia, Gestamp Severstal Vsevolozhsk LLC and Gestamp Severstal Kaluga LLC.
The current shareholding structure of the joint venture company is as follows: Gestamp (through the
company Gestamp Holding Rusia, S.L.) 74.98% of the share capital; Severstal (through Severstal Trade

**Environmental**

We have a strong commitment to environmental issues and the impact of our operations on the
environment, including with respect to climate change. We are also committed to maintaining high
standards of health and safety, both environmental and general. As of December 31, 2012, we had
80 employees dedicated to environmental issues and 72 employees dedicated to health and safety issues.

As manufacturers of automotive components, the impacts generated by us have to be taken into account
throughout the life cycle of the vehicle and not only during the manufacturing phase of our parts. For this
reason we are committed to adapting and using the best techniques available for our installations, as well
as to include environmental aspects in the design and operation of them.

Over the past five years, we have had no material environmental issues, actions, claims or liabilities and are
currently not aware of any such issues, actions, claims or liabilities.

In Gestamp it is a requirement that each center has an environmental management certificate that ensures
legislative compliance, minimization of contamination and the continued improvement in processes. The
majority of our plants are compliant with ISO 14.000 and some also have the European EMAS quality
standards.

At corporate level we also have an Environmental Indicator that enables us to monitor the main
environmental aspects of all of our production centers. This document considers:

- **Baseline consumption: Of energy, water and principle raw materials and stocked products;**

- **CO2 emissions: We reduced our CO2 emissions in 2012 by 15% relative to our CO2 emissions in 2011.**
This was achieved through a variety of initiatives including, but not limited to, technical improvements
in manufacturing plants and the acquisition of new equipment and general organizational and systems
optimizations; and

- **Waste management: Each one of the plants identifies and separates the main categories of waste;**
hazardous and non-hazardous so that it is managed in the most appropriate way.

**Health and Safety**

In terms of Health and Safety we are aware of the risks in our business and have a policy that ensures that
both our employees and those from other companies working on our premises have a safe and healthy
working environment.

According to this policy, we use the same criteria when assessing the performance of any company in terms
of Health and Safety and no difference is established between the companies operating in the countries in
which we are present.

By means of our own indicator which we call GIRPW (Gestamp’s Index of Risk Prevention in the
Workplace) we carry out a quarterly inspection to monitor working conditions and the degree of
implementation of management systems. This inspection allows us to identify the improvements
implemented and to prepare new plans of action.

96


-----

There is also a system of audits which verifies that these improvements meet with the criteria established in
standards, thereby assuring reliability and comparability among the companies.

**Proceedings**

We are from time to time involved in legal proceedings, claims or investigations that are incidental to the
conduct of our business. We vigorously defend ourselves against these claims. In future periods, we could
be subject to cash costs or non-cash charges to earnings if any of these matters is resolved on unfavorable
terms. However, although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty,
based on current information, including our assessment of the merits of the particular claims, we do not
expect that our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material adverse impact on our future
consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As of May 2, 2013, the material
proceedings to which we are a party have an aggregate estimated potential liability of A55.0 million, of
which approximately A45.7 million relates to contingent liabilities associated with tax audits in Brazil. We
have not made any provisions with respect to these contingent tax liabilities in Brazil, because we believe
there is a low probability that we may be required to recognize any liability accociated with these tax events
in Brazil.

**Employees**

Over the past decade, as our operations have grown, we have seen employee headcount grow
commensurately by almost 400%. As of December 31, 2012, we had 30,313 employees globally, of which
49%, 10%, 10%, 17% and 14% were based in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South
America and Asia, respectively.

Our strategy is to manage relations with our employees primarily on a plant level, with the ‘‘plant works
council’’ being the forum for employee representation most favored by our employees. As a general rule,
each plant has its own collective agreement. This policy allows us to benefit from a number of advantages:

- collective agreements are adapted to the specific circumstances and needs of each plant (for example
different geographic areas within a country may have different average salary or cost of living
allowances);

- collective agreements can be adapted to the economic performance and productivity of each plant;
and

- workers identify themselves better with their own ‘‘plant works council’’ rather than with a country
level one.

In addition to this strategy, we try to build open and trusting relations with Union representatives at
regional level or country level, in order to allow a bi-directional communication channel to provide them
with relevant information, but also to understand their real worries and concerns.

During the global economic crisis, we proactively managed our employee requirements while endeavoring
to find constructive measures to manage and retain experienced professionals. Given the global nature of
our business and operations, the measures implemented required an in-depth analysis of the legal
framework of each jurisdiction in which we operate. Our extensive global footprint has also given us a tool
to fight the impact of the global economic crisis as it has allowed for increased geographical mobility and
provided us with the ability to temporarily balance our resources across different regions, supporting
strategic projects with the most skilled and experienced workers.

Where the opportunities have arisen and it has been possible to do so, we have deployed under-utilized
staffing resources from one area of our business to other areas experiencing increased staffing
requirements, for example in new greenfield projects in Argentina, Brazil, the US, Russia and India. As a
result, we have been able to leverage the know-how of our experienced professionals to ensure that the
new plants are well supervised by a trained workforce, achieving the required quality standards, while also
retaining key resources.

In addition, we have been able to maintain a streamlined temporary workforce which allows us to react to
the evolving demands of our business, partially mitigating the negative effects of the global economic crisis
in a short period of time.

Where necessary and where the legal and regulatory labor and employment framework in a jurisdiction
allows, we have implemented measures such as temporary reduction of the workforce, early retirement
programs (as a way to achieve cost reduction in the short term and to reduce the average age of the staff in
the medium to long term) and ‘‘Substitute Contracts’’ which has proven to be an efficient way to manage
costs and rejuvenate the workforce, while accommodating the aging population.

utilized if they are each utilized pro rata to the available commitments under such facility on the date of
utilization. Facility A may be utilized by Gestamp Automoci´on only and Facility B may be utilized by the
Issuer only. Gestamp Automocion and the Issuer are required to apply amounts drawn under Facility A
and Facility B (if made available) towards: (i) refinancing certain existing indebtedness of Gestamp
Automoci´on and its subsidiaries (the ‘‘Group’’) and payment of associated costs and expenses; (ii) payment
of costs and expenses incurred by the Group in relation to entry into the Senior Facilities Agreement and
issuance of the notes; and (iii) general corporate purposes of the Group.

The Revolving Credit Facility will be available (subject to satisfaction of various customary conditions
precedent) from the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement until the date that falls one month prior to the
date that is five years from the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility may
be utilized by Gestamp Automoci´on and its subsidiaries incorporated in Spain or Luxembourg (or
otherwise as approved) that accede to the Senior Facilities Agreement as Revolving Credit Facility
borrowers. Amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility can be used for general corporate and
working capital purposes of the Group. The Revolving Credit Facility may also be utilized by way of letters
of credit and the Group has the ability to enter into bilateral ancillary facilities with lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility.

**Interest rates and fees**

The interest rate on each loan under the Senior Facilities Agreement for each interest period is the rate
per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable (a) margin (see below) and (b) LIBOR or, in relation
to any loan in euro, EURIBOR.

The initial margin for Facility A and the Revolving Credit Facility is 3.50% per annum. The margin for the
Facility B (if made available) will be agreed between Gestamp Automoci´on and the Facility B lenders.

102


-----

There is a margin adjustment mechanism in the Senior Facilities Agreement pursuant to which the margin
applicable to the Facility A and the Revolving Credit Facility will be adjusted upwards or downwards based
on the ratio of Net Financial Indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA in respect of any relevant testing period,
as demonstrated in the compliance certificate required to be delivered with the annual audited and
quarterly unaudited financial statements of the Group. There will be no adjustment to the initial margins
set out above until a period of at least 12 months has elapsed since the Closing Date . While an event of
default is continuing under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the applicable margin will be the highest
margin applicable to each Senior Facility.

Pursuant to the Senior Facilities Agreement, Gestamp Automoci´on is obligated to pay certain fees,
including an arrangement and structuring fee, and a commitment fee in respect of the available but
undrawn Revolving Facility commitments.

**Guarantees**

Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, Gestamp Automoci´on, the Issuer and certain
subsidiaries of Gestamp Automoci´on (together with Gestamp Automoci´on and the Issuer, the ‘‘SFA
Guarantors’’) guarantee all amounts due to the lenders and other finance parties under the Senior
Facilities Agreement and related finance documents. The guarantees granted by the SFA Guarantors are
subject to certain guarantee limitations which are set out in the Senior Facilities Agreement. These
guarantee limitations primarily limit the scope of the guarantees granted by the SFA Guarantors to ensure
that they comply with the laws of the jurisdictions in which the SFA Guarantors are incorporated.

Gestamp Automoci´on is required to ensure that Gestamp Toledo, S.L., Gestamp Levante, S.L., Edscha
Burges, S.L. and Edscha Santander, S.L. are converted to Sociedad An´onimas as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement (and in any event prior to the date that is
6 months after the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement) and after such conversion, ensure that they
accede to the Senior Facilities Agreement as guarantors.

Gestamp Automoci´on is required to ensure that each of its subsidiaries in which it holds at least 90 per
cent. of the ordinary shares, and which for the last financial year has (a) earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization (i) calculated on the same basis as EBITDA, representing 2.50%. or more
of the Group’s EBITDA; and (ii) (calculated on the same basis as EBITDA but on an unconsolidated
basis) greater than A10,000,000; or (b) which has net assets representing 2.5% or more of the Group’s net
assets (calculated on a consolidated basis) (a company meeting these criteria being a ‘‘Material
Company’’), accedes to the Senior Facilities Agreement as an additional guarantor as soon as possible after
becoming a Material Company. The obligation to require such a Material Company to accede as a
guarantor is subject to certain limitations specified in the Senior Facilities Agreement and does not apply
to a Spanish company established as an Agrupaci´on de Inter´es Econ´omico or any subsidiary incorporated
in any country located in North America or South America or in Japan, China, South Korea, India or
Taiwan.

Any subsidiary of Gestamp Automoci´on that becomes a guarantor in respect of the notes is also required
to accede to the Senior Facilities Agreement as a guarantor.

**Security**

Gestamp Automoci´on and (other than in relation to paragraph (e) below) Gestamp Servicios, S.A. are
required, within 10 business days of the Closing Date, to grant Spanish law pledges (the ‘‘Initial Share
Pledges’’) over all of the shares held by them in the following subsidiaries:

(a) Gestamp Metalbages, S.A.;

(b) Gestamp Bizkaia, S.A.;

(c) Gestamp Vigo, S.A.;

(d) Gestamp Palencia, S.A.; and

(e) Gestamp Servicios, S.A.

(The companies listed in (a) to (e) above being the ‘‘Initial Share Security Subsidiaries’’).

Gestamp Automoci´on and Gestamp Servicios, S.A. are also required to grant a Spanish law governed
pledge (the ‘‘Gestamp Toledo Share Pledge’’ and together with the Initial Share Pledges and the Gestamp

103


-----

Servicios Share Pledge (as defined below), the ‘‘Senior Facilities and Senior Secured Notes Share
Pledges’’) over the shares held by them in Gestamp Toledo, S.L. (‘‘Gestamp Toledo’’ and together with the
Initial Share Security Subsidiaries, the ‘‘Share Security Subsidiaries’’) as soon as reasonably practicable
after the conversion of Gestamp Toledo to a Sociedad An´onima (and in any event within 6 months after
the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement), which conversion Gestamp Automoci´on is required to
procure occurs as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement (and in
any event within 6 months after the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement). Gestamp Toledo is required
to grant a Spanish law governed pledge (the ‘‘Gestamp Servicios Share Pledge’’) over the shares it owns in
Gestamp Servicios, S.A. as soon as reasonably practicable after its conversion to a Sociedad An´onima (and
in any event within 6 months after the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement).

The Senior Facilities and Senior Secured Notes Share Pledges will secure obligations owed under the
Senior Facilities Agreement and related finance documents and the notes. Simultaneously with entry into
the Initial Share Pledges, the Gestamp Toledo Share Pledge and the Gestamp Servicios Share Pledge,
Gestamp Automoci´on and where applicable, Gestamp Servicios, S.A. and Gestamp Toledo will grant
Spanish law governed pledges (the ‘‘Existing Creditor Share Pledges’’) over the shares they hold in the
Initial Share Security Subsidiaries and Gestamp Toledo as security for amounts owed in respect of the
Designated Existing Indebtedness. The Senior Facilities Agreement also permits Gestamp Automoci´on
and its subsidiaries to grant pledges (the ‘‘Future Creditor Share Pledges’’ and together with the Senior
Facilities and Senior Secured Notes Share Pledges and the Existing Creditor Share Pledges, the
‘‘Transaction Security’’) over the shares it holds in the Share Security Subsidiaries as security for
obligations that may in the future be owed by the Group to other creditors subject to satisfaction of certain
conditions set out in the indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement (any
such indebtedness being ‘‘Additional Senior Financing’’). The security created by the Transaction Security
will rank in the order described in the section titled ‘‘—Intercreditor Agreement’’ below.

**Undertakings**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain negative undertakings that, subject to certain customary
and other agreed exceptions, limit the ability of each obligor (and in certain cases, members of the Group)
to, among other things:

- incur or allow to remain outstanding financial indebtedness;

- be a creditor in respect of financial indebtedness;

- create or permit to subsist any security over any of its assets;

- sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of its assets;

- issue or allow to remain outstanding any guarantee in respect of any liability or obligation owed to any
person;

- declare or pay any dividend or other payment or distribution of any kind on or in respect of any of its
shares; and

- make acquisitions of companies, businesses or undertakings.

In addition to the undertakings listed above, the Senior Facilities Agreement contains a number of other
customary positive and negative undertakings.

**Financial covenants**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains financial covenants that require the Group to ensure that:

- the ratio of EBITDA to Financial Expenses is not lower 5.00:1.00 on each testing date; and

- the ratio of Net Financial Indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA is not higher than 3.00:1.00 on each
testing date.

The financial covenants will be first tested in respect of the testing period ending on or around
December 31, 2013.

104


-----

**Maturity**

Loans drawn under Facility A are required to be repaid in semi-annual instalments, starting from the date
that is 12 months after the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement, in accordance with an amortization
schedule set out in the Senior Facilities Agreement, with the final repayment instalment due on the date
that is five years after the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement. Loans drawn under Facility B (if made
available) have to be repaid in a single instalment on the date that is six years after the date of the Senior
Facilities Agreement. Each loan under the Revolving Credit Facility is required to be repaid on the last day
of each interest period, provided however that Revolving Credit Facility loans may be redrawn subject to
the terms and conditions set out in the Senior Facilities Agreement. All outstanding loans under the
Revolving Credit Facility and any outstanding letters of credit are required to be repaid in full on the date
that is five years after the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement.

**Prepayments**

Subject to certain conditions, Gestamp Automoci´on or the other borrowers under the Senior Facilities
Agreement may voluntarily cancel any available commitments under, or voluntarily prepay any outstanding
utilizations of, the Senior Facilities by giving 3 business days’ prior notice to the Agent. Any Facility A or
Facility B loans that are prepaid may not be reborrowed and the relevant commitments will be cancelled.
Any Revolving Credit Facility utilizations that are prepaid may (subject to the terms of the Senior Facilities
Agreement) be reborrowed.

Subject to certain exceptions and/or thresholds, mandatory prepayments of amounts outstanding under the
Senior Facilities are required to be made upon the disposal of certain categories of assets, recovery of
insurance claim proceeds or a flotation (which does not cause a change of control of Gestamp
Automoci´on).

A change of control of Gestamp Automoci´on will trigger a 30 day consultation period with the lenders
under the Senior Facilities Agreement. At the end of such consultation period, each lender who does not
wish to continue being a lender under the Senior Facilities Agreement may request prepayment of all
amounts owed to it. Any lender who makes such a request must be prepaid within five business days and all
of such lender’s commitments will be cancelled. The Senior Facilities will be automatically cancelled and
be immediately repayable upon a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Group to a third party.

‘‘change of control’’ for these purposes means Corporacion Gestamp Group, Arcelor Mittal Group and
their respective affiliates ceasing to directly or indirectly (a) have the power to (i) cast, or control the
casting of, at least 50.01% of the votes that may be cast in a general meeting of Gestamp Automoci´on;
(ii) appoint or remove all, or the majority of the directors or equivalent officers of Gestamp Automoci´on;
or (iii) give directions with respect to the operating and financial policies of Gestamp Automoci´on with
which the directors or equivalent officers are obliged to comply; or (b) hold beneficially at least 50.01% of
the issued share capital of Gestamp Automoci´on with voting rights.

**Events of default**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains events of default customary for financings of this nature (with
customary and agreed thresholds and carve-outs), the occurrence of any of which will allow the lenders
under the Senior Facilities Agreement to cancel available commitments under the Senior Facilities, declare
all amounts owed under the Senior Facilities Agreement to be due upon demand and/or demand
immediate repayment of all amounts owed under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

On May 10, 2013, Gestamp Automoci´on, the Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Trustee, the Agent, the
Security Agent, the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain other parties entered into
the Intercreditor Agreement to establish the relative rights of certain of the Group’s creditors including
creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the indenture for the notes, the Designated Existing
Indebtedness and any Additional Senior Financings. By accepting a note, holders of notes will be deemed
to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement. See ‘‘Annex B:
Intercreditor Agreement’’.

105


-----

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out:

- the ranking of the indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the notes, the Designated
Existing Indebtedness and any Additional Senior Financing (together the ‘‘Senior Secured Debt’’ and
the creditors to whom the Senior Secured Debt is owed being the ‘‘Senior Secured Creditors’’);

- the ranking of the security created pursuant to the Transaction Security;

- the procedure for enforcement of the Transaction Security and any guarantee granted in favour of the
Senior Secured Creditors and the allocation of proceeds resulting from such enforcement;

- the types of disposals permitted under distressed and non-distressed scenarios and the Security
Agent’s authority to release the Transaction Security and guarantees granted in favour of the Senior
Secured Creditors in case of a distressed and non-distressed disposal;

- the terms pursuant to which intra-Group debt and certain debt owed to Corporaci´on Gestamp (not
including the on-loan by Corporaci´on Gestamp of the proceeds of the EIB Loan Facility and the ICO
Loan Facility) and other equity investors (‘‘Equity Investor Liabilities’’) will be subordinated; and

- turnover provisions.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It
does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and, as such, we urge you to read that
document (set out in Annex B) because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights (and
restrictions on entitlement) of the holders of the notes and other Senior Secured Creditors.

**Priority of debts**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that all liabilities owed under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the
notes, the Designated Existing Indebtedness and the Additional Senior Financing (including in each case,
any liabilities owed pursuant to any guarantees given in respect of such debt) rank pari passu and without
any preference between them and in priority to any intra-Group debt and Equity Investor Liabilities.

**Ranking of security**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Transaction Security ranks and secures the Senior Secured
Debt as follows:

(a) first, security created pursuant to the Senior Facilities and Senior Secured Notes Share Pledges which
security secures indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement and indebtedness in respect of
the notes pari passu and without any preference between them;

(b) second, security created pursuant to the Existing Creditor Share Pledges which security secures the
Designated Existing Indebtedness _pari passu and without any preference between the different_
facilities; and

(c) thereafter, security created pursuant to the Future Creditor Share Pledges and any security created
pursuant to share pledges granted in favour of lenders of ancillary facilities entered into under the
Senior Facilities Agreement after the date of the Initial Share Pledges (each such facility a
‘‘Subsequent Ancillary Facility’’) in the order of priority in which they are entered into in respect of
indebtedness under any Additional Senior Financing and Subsequent Ancillary Facility.

Notwithstanding the order of ranking set out above, the date of execution or order the Transaction Security
documents are entered into, or the ranking under applicable law, it is agreed that the Transaction Security
ranks and secures the Senior Secured Debt pari passu without preference between the different categories
of Senior Secured Debt.

**Enforcement and application of proceeds**

The Intercreditor Agreement sets forth procedures for enforcement of the Transaction Security. Subject to
the Transaction Security having become enforceable, Senior Secured Creditors whose Senior Credit
Participations aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Credit Participations (the ‘‘Instructing Group’’)
are entitled to direct the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security, as
they see fit. The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless otherwise
instructed by Instructing Group. For these purposes, ‘‘Senior Credit Participations’’ means at any time in
relation to a Senior Secured Creditor, the aggregate amount owed to such Senior Secured Creditor.

106


-----

The proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or any guarantees granted in respect of the
Senior Secured Debt and all other amounts paid to the Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement
shall be applied in the following order:

- first, in payment on a _pari passu and_ _pro rata basis any sums (including fees, costs, expenses and_
liabilities) owing to (i) the Security Agent or any receiver, delegate, attorney or agent appointed under
the Transaction Security documents or the Intercreditor Agreement; (ii) the Agent or any creditor
representative in its capacity as such (but not bilateral lenders) in respect of any Additional Senior
Financing; and (iii) the Trustee;

- second, on a _pari passu and_ _pro rata basis to the (i) Agent on its own behalf and on behalf of the_
creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement; (ii) the Trustee on its own behalf and on behalf of the
noteholders; (iii) each creditor in respect of the Designated Existing Indebtedness; and (iv) any
creditor representative in respect of an Additional Senior Financing on its own behalf and on behalf
of the creditors under such Additional Senior Financing, for application towards the discharge of
amounts owed under the Senior Facilities Agreement (in accordance with the terms thereof), the
notes (in accordance with the Indenture), the Designated Existing Indebtedness (on a pro rata basis)
and any Additional Senior Financing (on a pro rata basis);

- third, if none of the debtors is under any further actual or contingent liability under any of the Senior
Secured Debt documents, in payment to any person the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to
any debtor; and

- fourth, in payment or distribution to the relevant debtors.

**Distressed and non-distressed disposals**

The Security Agent is authorised (without the requirement to obtain any further consent or authorisation
from any Senior Secured Creditor) to release from the Transaction Security any asset that is the subject of
a disposal permitted by the Senior Secured Debt documents and the Transaction Security documents and
which is not a Distressed Disposal. A Distressed Disposal means a disposal effected (i) by way of
enforcement of the Transaction Security; (ii) at the request of the Instructing Group in circumstances
where the Transaction Security has become enforceable; or (iii) by a debtor to a third party (not being a
member of the Group) after any of the Senior Secured Debt has been accelerated.

If to the extent permitted by applicable law a Distressed Disposal is being effected or the shares of the
Share Security Subsidiaries are being appropriated by the Security Agent, the Security Agent is authorised
(without the requirement to obtain any further consent or authorisation from any Senior Secured Creditor
or other relevant party): (i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over any asset subject to
the Distressed Disposal or appropriation; and (ii) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal or
appropriation is the shares of a Group company, to release such Group Company and/or its subsidiaries
from any liabilities under borrowings and/or guarantees under the Senior Secured Debt documents, IntraGroup debt documents or documents evidencing Equity Investor Liabilities.

**Intra-Group debt**

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, Gestamp Automoci´on and its subsidiaries party thereto that are
creditors in respect of intra-Group debt have agreed to subordinate intra-Group debt to the Senior
Secured Debt.

Neither Gestamp Automoci´on nor any of its subsidiaries that are creditors in respect of Intra-Group debt
may accept the benefit of any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of
intra-Group debt unless such action is permitted under the Senior Secured Debt documents. Neither
Gestamp Automoci´on nor any other subsidiary may make any payment, prepayment, repayment or
otherwise acquire or discharge any intra-Group debt if acceleration action has been taken in respect of any
of the Senior Secured Debt unless the Instructing Group consent or such action is undertaken to facilitate
repayment or prepayment of the Senior Secured Debt.

**Equity Investor Liabilities**

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, Corporaci´on Gestamp S.L. and future equity investors party
thereto have agreed to subordinate the Equity Investor Liabilities to the Senior Secured Debt. Gestamp
Automoci´on and other debtors may make payments in respect of the Equity Investor Liabilities provided

107


-----

that such payments are permitted under the terms of the Senior Secured Debt documents and the
documents evidencing the Equity Investor Liabilities. No equity investor may accept the benefit of any
security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of Equity Investor Liabilities prior
to the first date on which all of the Senior Secured Debt has been discharged.

**Turnover**

If any creditor party to the Intercreditor Agreement (including the Agent, Security Agent, Trustee, Senior
Secured Creditors, creditors in respect of intra-Group debt and creditors in respect of Equity Investor
Liabilities) receives or recovers a payment (whether by way of direct payment, set-off or otherwise) except
as permitted pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, such creditor shall hold such payment
in trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay over such amounts to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the provision described above under ‘‘Enforcement and application of proceeds’’.

**Existing Debt Facilities**

The following is a brief description of our other interest bearing loans and borrowings that are currently in
effect (‘‘Existing Debt Facilities’’).

**Banc of America loan**

On March 21, 2012 we entered into a A60.0 million facility agreement with Banc of America Securities
Limited as arranger and as initial lender (‘‘Banc of America loan’’). The purpose of the Banc of America
loan is financing general corporate purposes. This facility has a scheduled termination date of March 21,

we account for this liability as a contingent obligation in our financial statements. Of the total loan
proceeds from the EIB loan and the ICO loan, Corporaci´on Gestamp, S.L. passed on A143.0 million to us.
As of December 31, 2012, the current balance between Corporaci´on Gestamp, S.L. and us in respect of this

maturing on September 30, 2020.

The 2007 loan is secured by amongst other things pledges of certain real estate assets of the borrowers.
Under all loans, IKB has certain rights to be granted (additional) security (under certain circumstances) in
particular by way of positive pledges (in the case of the 2011 loan) and/or negative pledges (in the case of
the 2007 and 2012 loans). In addition, the 2011 loans contain cross default clauses. The three loans of 2012

50% of distributable profits . The loan of 2012 contains furthermore restrictions such as on the sale, pledge
or other disposal of shares held by the borrowers in companies held by them. The loan of 2007 contains

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading ‘‘Certain
Definitions.’’ In this description, the word ‘‘Issuer’’ refers only to Gestamp Funding Luxembourg S.A. and
the word ‘‘Company’’ refers only to Gestamp Automoci´on, S.A. and not to any of its subsidiaries.

The Issuer has issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2020
denominated in U.S. Dollars (the ‘‘Dollar Notes’’) and A500 million aggregate principal amount of senior
secured notes due 2020 denominated in euro (the ‘‘Euro Notes’’ and, together with the Dollar Notes, the
‘‘Notes’’) under an Indenture (the ‘‘Indenture’’) dated the Issue Date among itself, the Company, the
Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined below), Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as the trustee (in such
capacity, the ‘‘Trustee’’), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as Security Agent, Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch, as paying agent, and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as transfer agent and registrar, in
a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The
Indenture does not incorporate or include any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ The terms of the Notes are subject to the provisions of the Indenture.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and certain provisions
of the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement in their
entirety. We urge you to read the Intercreditor Agreement attached hereto because it, along with the
Indenture, and not this description, defines your rights as a holder of the notes. Copies of the Indenture
are available upon request as set forth under ‘‘Where You Can Find More Information.’’ Certain defined
terms used in this description but not defined below under ‘‘—Certain Definitions’’ have the meanings
assigned to them in the Indenture.

The registered holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders
will have rights under the Indenture.

Subject to compliance with the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock,’’ the Issuer may also issue an
unlimited amount of additional Dollar Notes and or additional Euro Notes at later dates under the
Indenture (‘‘Additional Notes’’). Any Additional Notes that the Issuer issues in the future will be identical
in all respects to the Notes that the Issuer is issuing hereby (including with respect to Note Guarantees),
except that notes issued in the future will have different issuance prices and issuance dates. All Notes,
including any Additional Notes, will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture,
including (without limitation), with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase;
provided that Additional Notes will not be issued with the same CUSIP, if any, as existing Notes unless
such Additional Notes are fungible with the existing Notes for tax purposes. Unless the context otherwise
requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this ‘‘Description of the Notes,’’ references to the Notes
include the Notes offered hereby and any Additional Notes actually issued.

For purposes of any covenant summarized herein, any reference to an amount in ‘‘A’’ shall mean, in respect
of any amount in any currency other than euro, the Euro Equivalent thereof.

**Brief Description of the Notes, the Funding Loan, the Note Guarantees and the Intercreditor**
**Agreement**

On May 10, 2013, the Company entered into two loan agreements in order to finance its worldwide
activities (the ‘‘Funding Loan’’) under which it borrowed the proceeds of the Notes and agreed to repay an
amount equal to the principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture pursuant to the Funding
Loan. The Notes are initially guaranteed by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors as of the Issue
Date and may, in the future, be guaranteed by further of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries (each such
guarantee, a ‘‘Note Guarantee’’). A Note Guarantee given by a Subsidiary Guarantor may be released in
certain circumstances described herein.

**_The Notes and the Funding Loan_**

The Notes:

- are general senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuer
that is not subordinated to the Notes;

110


-----

- rank senior in right of payment to any and all future obligations of the Issuer that are subordinated to
the Notes;

- are structurally subordinated to all Indebtedness, other obligations and claims of holders of preferred
stock of the Company’s subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that are not Subsidiary Guarantors;

- are effectively subordinated to all of the Issuer’s obligations that are secured by assets of the Issuer to
the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations; and

- are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantors, as described under ‘‘—The Note
Guarantees’’.

The Issuer’s only material asset is the obligation of the Company to make payments on the Funding Loan
in respect of the Notes.

The Funding Loan is:

- a general unsecured senior obligation of the Company;

- effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured Indebtedness of the Company to the extent
of the value of the assets so secured; and

- effectively subordinated (in an insolvency proceeding) to any non-related third party Indebtedness of
the Company except for such Indebtedness that have been set aside as fraudulent by a court.

As of December 31, 2012, after giving pro forma effect to this offering, the entering into of the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the Mitsui Investment and the application of the proceeds therefrom, we would have
had total Indebtedness, including the Notes, of A1,835.4 million.

The Funding Loan requires the Company to make appropriate payments under the Funding Loan to
enable the Issuer to fulfill its obligations under the Indenture. Upon the issuance of any Additional Notes,
the proceeds thereof will be loaned to the Company pursuant to an additional loan on substantially the
same terms as the Funding Loan.

**The Note Guarantees**

Each Note Guarantee:

- is a senior secured obligation in the case of the Company and a senior unsecured obligation in the case
of each Subsidiary Guarantor;

- ranks pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
not subordinated to that Guarantor’s Note Guarantee;

- ranks senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is subordinated in
right of payment to that Guarantor’s Note Guarantee;

- is effectively subordinated to that Guarantor’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent
of the value of the property or assets securing such indebtedness unless such property or assets also
secure the Notes on an equal and ratable or priority basis; and

- is structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of any of that Guarantor’s
subsidiaries (other than, in the case of the Company, the Issuer) that do not guarantee the Notes.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries were ‘‘Restricted Subsidiaries’’. However, under
the circumstances described below under the subheading ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Designation of
Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’, the Company will be permitted to designate certain of its
Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’. The Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to many of
the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

Not all of our Subsidiaries initially guaranteed the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization of any non-guarantor Subsidiaries, these Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and
their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Company. The
Company is a holding company dependent upon the cash flow of its operating company subsidiaries in
order to satisfy its obligations under its Note Guarantee and the Funding Loan.

The Guarantors consist of the Company, which holds all of our Restricted Subsidiaries, and the Subsidiary
Guarantors. The Subsidiary Guarantors, as at the Issue Date, consisted of certain of the Company’s

111


-----

subsidiaries incorporated in Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia,
Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The Subsidiary Guarantors include both operating companies
and various intermediate holding companies. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Subsidiary
Guarantors (excluding Edscha Santander, S.L., Edscha Burgos, S.L., Gestamp Toledo, S.L. and Gestamp
Levante, S.L.) represented approximately 44.4% of our total consolidated assets and approximately 49.7%
of our consolidated EBITDA. As of December 31, 2012, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to this
offering, the entering into of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Mitsui Investment and the application of
the proceeds therefrom, the Company’s subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that have guaranteed the
Notes would have had approximately A232.2 million of Indebtedness outstanding.

In addition, pursuant to the covenant entitled ‘‘—Additional Note Guarantees’’, subject to certain
exceptions, any Restricted Subsidiary (i) that after the Issue Date is or becomes a Material Subsidiary
(except for Restricted Subsidiaries which are Material Subsidiaries at the Issue Date but not initial
Subsidiary Guarantors and Restricted Subsidiaries that are not 90% or more owned by the Company) or
(ii) that guarantees certain Indebtedness of other entities, will also be required to become a Guarantor.

The Note Guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The obligations of the Subsidiary
Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Note Guarantee to reflect limitations under
applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance and
other legal restrictions applicable to the Subsidiary Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors
and general partners. For a description of such limitations, see ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks related to the notes—
The Guarantees are significantly limited by applicable laws and are subject to certain limitations or
defenses’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks related to the notes—The granting of guarantees by Spanish
companies is restricted by Spanish law’’. See also ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks related to the notes—Fraudulent
conveyance laws may limit your rights as a holder of notes’’.

**Release of Note Guarantees**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released:

(1) in the case of a Note Guarantee by a Subsidiary Guarantor only, in connection with any sale or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Subsidiary Guarantor (including by
way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a Person that is not (either
before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, if the
sale or other disposition does not violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture, and all
obligations of the Guarantor with respect to Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities are
also released;

(2) in the case of a Note Guarantee by a Subsidiary Guarantor only, in connection with any sale of all
of the Capital Stock of that Subsidiary Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after
giving effect to such transaction) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale complies
with the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture, and all obligations of the Guarantor with
respect to Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities are also released;

(3) in the case of a Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor only, if the Company designates any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(4) upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance or discharge of the Notes as described under the
captions ‘‘Defeasance’’ and ‘‘Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

(5) as described under the caption ‘‘Amendment, Supplement and Waiver’’;

(6) in the case of a Note Guarantee granted pursuant to the covenant entitled ‘‘—Additional Note
Guarantees’’, upon the discharge of the Indebtedness or the release and discharge of the
guarantee that gave rise to the obligation to guarantee the Notes; or

(7) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

See ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Equity Interests in Restricted Subsidiaries’’.

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

Pursuant to the Security Documents, the obligations of the Company and Gestamp Servicios, S.A. (other
than in relation to clause (v) below) under their respective Note Guarantees will initially be secured by a
first priority lien on the shares of capital stock of (i) Gestamp Metalbages, S.A., (ii) Gestamp Bizcaia, S.A.,
(iii) Gestamp Vigo, S.A., (iv) Gestamp Palencia, S.A., (v) Gestamp Servicios, S.A. and (vi) Gestamp
Toledo, S.L. (in the case of Gestamp Toledo, S.L. only after it has been converted to a Sociedad An´onima,
and upon such conversion Gestamp Toledo, S.L. shall pledge the shares it owns in Gestamp Servicios, S.A.)
(the ‘‘Collateral’’). The Indenture will provide that the Collateral shall be granted by the Company,
Gestamp Servicios, S.A. and Gestamp Toledo, S.L. to secure their respective Note Guarantees
substantially concurrently with their grant of such Collateral to secure the obligations of the obligors under
the Senior Credit Facilities. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities—Security’’.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Liens’’, the Company is permitted to pledge or cause its Subsidiaries to pledge the Collateral
in connection with future incurrence of Indebtedness, including issuances of Additional Notes, permitted
under the Indenture on a _pari passu basis with the then outstanding Notes. The Collateral can also be_
released from the Liens of the Security Documents under certain circumstances. See ‘‘—Release of
Security Interests’’ below.

**_Administration of Collateral and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Collateral will be administered by a Security Agent pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents
and the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of all holders of the Notes and the finance parties under
the Senior Credit Facilities and creditors under the Designated Existing Indebtedness and certain other
future secured creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the Intercreditor
Agreement, see ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’.

The ability of holders of the Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various bankruptcy law
limitations in the event of the Company’s bankruptcy and various limitations on enforcement contained in
the Intercreditor Agreement. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks related to the notes—The enforcement of the
Collateral may be restricted by Spanish law’’, ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks related to the notes—Fraudulent
conveyance laws may limit your rights as a holder of notes’’ and Risk Factors—Risks related to the notes—
Local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of another jurisdiction with
which you may be more familiar’’.

The rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Collateral must be exercised by the Security
Agent. Since the holders of the Notes are not a party to the Security Documents, holders may not,
individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security
Documents. The holders may only act through the Security Agent. The Security Agent will agree to any
release of the security interest created by the Security Documents in accordance with terms of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the holders of the Notes.
Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Notes will, in certain
circumstances, share in or have the ability to direct the Trustee to direct the Security Agent to commence
enforcement action under the Security Documents. However, in enforcing the Liens provided for under
the Security Documents, the Security Agent will take direction from the Trustee (subject to the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement). Please see ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’.

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, until the acceleration of amounts due under the Notes in
accordance with the Indenture, the Company and other pledgors will be entitled to exercise any and all
voting rights in a manner which does not materially adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the
Liens created under the Security Documents or the value of the Collateral and to receive and retain any
and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting
from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distribution (whether similar
or dissimilar to the foregoing) in respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral.

The value of the Collateral securing the Note and the Company’s Note Guarantee may not be sufficient to
satisfy the Issuer’s and the Company’s obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees, and the
Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional
Notes or other future incurrences of Indebtedness and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral,
subject to the terms of the Indenture.

113


-----

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer or the Guarantors in
connection with this offering of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale of
Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents
following an Event of Default, would be sufficient to satisfy the amounts due on the Notes or the Note
Guarantees. By its nature, all of the Collateral is likely to be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral would be sold in a timely manner
or at all.

The Security Documents will be governed by Spanish law and will be subject to the jurisdiction of the
Spanish courts.

**_Release of Security Interests_**

All of the Liens granted under the Security Documents will be automatically and unconditionally released
in accordance with the terms and conditions in the Indenture upon Legal Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance as described under ‘‘—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’, if all obligations under
the Indenture are discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or as otherwise permitted in
accordance with the Indenture, including but not limited to the covenants under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Impairment of Security Interest’’, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Liens on the Collateral granted in the Security Documents will be released:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral, if the sale or other disposition does
not violate the Indenture, and all liens on the Collateral securing Indebtedness under the Senior
Credit Facilities are also released;

(2) to the extent that such Collateral is sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant to an enforcement of
the security over such Collateral under the applicable Security Document(s) in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement;

(3) as described under ‘‘—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver’’; or

(4) in connection with a transaction permitted by the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’.

The Security Agent will take all reasonable action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing
the Notes and the Note Guarantees (if applicable), in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above
shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the holders or any action on the part of the
Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release).

**_Intercreditor Agreement_**

On or before the Issue Date, the Trustee shall enter into an Intercreditor Agreement with, among others,
the facility agent under the Senior Credit Facilities, creditors of the Designated Existing Indebtedness, the
Company, various subsidiaries of the Company, and the Security Agent, as described under ‘‘Description
of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and attached hereto as Annex B. The Security
Documents and the Collateral will be administered by the Security Agent pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, the creditors under the Senior
Credit Facilities, the Designated Existing Indebtedness and certain future Indebtedness of the Company
and its Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred and secured pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, recoveries received upon enforcement
over Collateral will be applied (subject to certain claims of the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Facility
Agent under the Senior Credit Facilities and costs and expenses related to the enforcement of the
Collateral) pro rata in repayment of liabilities in respect of (i) obligations under the Indenture, the Notes
and the Note Guarantees, (ii) obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities, (iii) obligations under the
Designated Existing Indebtedness and (iv) any other Indebtedness of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Trustee and the creditors under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Designated Existing Indebtedness
and the other secured parties under the Intercreditor Agreement have, and by accepting a Note, each
holder of a Note will be deemed to have, irrevocably appointed Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as
Security Agent to act as its security agent under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes, the Indenture,

114


-----

including the Note Guarantees, and the Security Documents (together, the ‘‘Finance Documents’’). The
Trustee and the creditors under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Designated Existing Indebtedness and
the other secured parties under the Intercreditor Agreement will have, and by accepting a Note, each
holder of a Note will be deemed to have, irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to perform the duties
and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor
Agreement or other Finance Documents, together with any incidental rights, power and discretions.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

The Issuer will pay all principal, interest, premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes
(as defined below) at the corporate trust office or agency of the Paying Agent (as defined below). All
payments on the Global Notes will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account

Payments of principal of, and premium, if any, on each Note in definitive registered form (‘‘Definitive
_Registered Notes’’) will be made by transfer on the due date to an account maintained by the payee_

relevant record date) or, if requested by the holder, by check mailed on the relevant due date (or if that is
not a business day, the immediately succeeding business day) to the holder (or to the first named of joint
holders) of the Definitive Registered Note appearing on the register of holders at the close of business at

premium, if any, and interest on Definitive Registered Notes are subject in all cases to any tax or other
laws and regulations applicable in the place of payment but without prejudice to the provisions under the
headings ‘‘—Optional Tax Redemption’’ and ‘‘—Additional Amounts’’. The Paying Agent may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge in connection with
any payment transfer instructions received by the Paying Agent. Definitive Registered Notes, if issued, will
only be issued in registered form.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will make all payments, including principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Dollar
Notes, through an agent in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York that it will maintain for these

one or more paying agents (each, a ‘‘Paying Agent’’) for the Euro Notes in the City of London, United
Kingdom. The initial Paying Agent is Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch. The initial Transfer Agent is
Deutsche Bank Luxembourg, S.A. The Transfer Agent is responsible for, among other things, facilitating
any transfers or exchanges of beneficial interests in different global notes between holders.

115


-----

In addition, the Issuer undertakes that it will ensure that it maintains a Paying Agent in a Member State of
the European Union that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to European Council Directive
2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the European Council of Economics
and Finance Ministers (‘‘ECOFIN’’) meeting of November 26-27, 2000 or any law implementing or
complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive.

The Issuer also will maintain one or more registrars (each a ‘‘Registrar’’) with offices in Luxembourg for so
long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and traded on the Euro
MTF Market and the Rules and Regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require. The initial
Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting
ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time and will make payments on
Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents or the Registrars without prior notice to the
holders. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
traded on the Euro MTF Market, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Transfer
Agent or Registrar in accordance with the requirements of the Rules and Regulations of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange.

of A100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of A1,000. The Notes will be serially numbered. In no
event will Definitive Registered Notes in bearer form be issued. See ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form’’.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor (each a ‘‘Payor’’) on the Notes or under or with respect
to any Note Guarantee will be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or
future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, assessments or similar governmental charges (including penalties,
additions to tax, and interest related thereto) (‘‘Taxes’’) unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes
is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied
by or on behalf of:

(1) Luxembourg, Spain or any political subdivision or governmental authority of any thereof or
therein having power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the Notes or a Note Guarantee is made, or
any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized or otherwise resident or
doing business for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or
therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a ‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’),

will at any time be required from any payments made with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee,
including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium (if any), the Payor will pay
(together with such payments) such additional amounts (the ‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be necessary in
order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each beneficial owner of the Notes or
the Note Guarantee, as the case may be, after such withholding or deduction by any applicable withholding
agent (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), equal the amounts
which would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or
deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary,
settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant holder or
beneficial owner, if the relevant holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust,
partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction,
(including any Tax imposed as a result of a holder or beneficial owner being a citizen or resident
or national or domiciliary of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment
in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (such as, for the avoidance of doubt, any net income Tax

116


-----

imposed under the Personal Income Tax, the Corporate Income Tax or the Non-resident Income
Tax by Spain as a result of such holder or beneficial owner being resident or doing business in
Spain)), other than a connection resulting from the mere acquisition, ownership or disposition of
such Note or enforcement of rights under or in respect of such Note or any Note Guarantee or
the receipt of payments under or in respect of such Note or any Note Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed if the holder or the beneficial owner of a Note
had made a declaration of non-residence or any other claim or filing for exemption to which it is
entitled (provided that (x) such declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for
exemption is required by applicable law, regulation, administrative practice or treaty of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from the requirement to deduct or
withhold all or a part of such Taxes and (y) at least 30 days prior to the first payment date with
respect to which such declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is
required under the applicable law of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, the relevant holder at that
time has been notified (in accordance with the procedures set forth in ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’)
by the Payor or any other Person through whom payment may be made that a declaration of
non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is required to be made), but, in each case,
only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to make such declaration or
other claim or filing;

(3) any Note presented for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the
relevant payment is first made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the
holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented during
such 30-day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by withholding in respect of a payment of the principal
of, premium, if any, interest or any other amounts under or with respect to the Notes or any Note
Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, property or similar Taxes;

(6) any withholding or deduction imposed in respect of a payment to a holder or beneficial owner
and required to be made pursuant to the European Union Directive on the taxation of savings
income (the ‘‘Directive’’) which was adopted by the ECOFIN Council of the European Union (the
Council of EU finance and economic ministers) on June 3, 2003 or any other Directive
implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN meeting of November 26-27, 2000, or any law
implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, the Directive;

(7) any Taxes which could have been avoided by the presentation (where presentation is required) of
the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union; or

(8) any combination of (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any holder who is a
fiduciary or a partnership or other than the beneficial owner of such Notes to the extent that the
beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial
owner of such Notes would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor,
member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly, but only if there is no material cost or commercial or
legal restriction to transferring the Notes to such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner.

The applicable withholding agent will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the
full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law.
The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of
any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will
provide such certified copies to the Trustee (or a holder upon request). If certified copies of such tax
receipts are not obtainable, the relevant Payor shall provide the Trustee (or a holder upon written request)
other evidence of payment reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (or such holder). The Payor will attach to
each certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified
copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding
and (y) the amount of such withholding Taxes paid per A1,000 or $1,000, as applicable, principal amount of
the Notes. Copies of such documentation will be available for inspection during ordinary business hours at
the office of the Trustee by the holders of the Notes upon request and will be made available at the offices

117


-----

of the Paying Agent located in Luxembourg if the Notes are then listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and traded on the Euro MTF Market.

At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note
Guarantee is due and payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises shortly before or
after the 30th day prior to such date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter), if the Payor will be
obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an
Officers’ Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable
and will set forth such other information necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts
to holders on the payment date. Each such Officers’ Certificate shall be relied upon until receipt of a
further Officers’ Certificate addressing such matters.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes, any Note Guarantee or this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ there are
mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal,

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes,

(3) interest, or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading
to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any
other excise, property or similar Taxes which arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution,
issuance, delivery, registration or enforcement of any Notes, the Indenture, any Note Guarantee or any
other document or instrument referred to therein, or any payments under or with respect to the Notes or
any Note Guarantee.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will
apply _mutatis mutandis to any successor to a Payor and to any jurisdiction in which such successor is_
incorporated, organized, doing business or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any
jurisdiction from or through which such successor (or its paying agent) makes any payment under or with
respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee and, in each case, any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to May 31, 2016, at the option of the Issuer or the Company, the Issuer may, upon giving
not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be
irrevocable), on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of Dollar
Notes issued under the Indenture at a redemption price of 105.625% of the principal amount and up to
35% of the aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes issued under the Indenture at a redemption price of
105.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, with
the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided that:

(1) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of Dollar Notes and 65% of the aggregate
principal amount of Euro Notes issued under the Indenture remain outstanding immediately
after the occurrence of such redemption (excluding Notes held by the Issuer or the Company and
its Subsidiaries); and

(2) the redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

After May 31, 2016, at the option of the Issuer or the Company, the Issuer may redeem all or a part of the
Dollar Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as
percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Dollar

In addition, the Issuer may on or prior to May 31, 2016, upon giving not less than 30 nor more than
60 days’ notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable), at its option on one or more
occasions redeem all or a portion of the Notes (which includes Additional Notes, if any) at a redemption
price equal to the sum of:

(1) 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus

(2) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus

(3) the Applicable Premium at the redemption date, subject to the right of holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on any interest payment date occurring on or prior to
the redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption**

Neither the Issuer nor the Company is required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments
with respect to the Notes.

**Optional Tax Redemption**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days’ notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
the date fixed for redemption (a ‘‘Tax Redemption Date’’) (subject to the right of holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and Additional
Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the
redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined above) which change or amendment is
publicly announced and becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, if a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, after such later
date);

(2) any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws,
treaties, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment or order by a court of
competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) of a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction, which change or amendment is publicly announced and becomes effective after the
Issue Date (or, if a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date
after the Issue Date, after such later date); (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a
‘‘Change in Tax Law’’); or

(3) a determination by the Spanish tax authorities (‘‘acta de inspecci´on’’ in Spanish terminology) after
the date hereof that interest payments by the Issuer are subject to Spanish withholding Tax as a

119


-----

result of the Issuer being a resident of Spain or having a permanent establishment in Spain to
which the Notes are connected,

the Issuer is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay any
Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to it
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent in accordance with the
second paragraph under ‘‘Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes’’ or payment through a Guarantor).

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be
given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer would be obliged to pay
Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional
Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes
pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officers’ Certificate stating that the
Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the
conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax
counsel of recognized standing to the Trustee to the effect that the circumstances referred to above exist.
The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of
the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and
binding on the holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor to the Issuer.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase
all or any part (equal to $200,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Dollar
Notes and equal to A100,000 or integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Euro Notes)
of that holder’s Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In
the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a Change of Control Payment in cash equal to 101% of
the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the
Notes repurchased, to the date of purchase. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer
will mail a notice to each holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of
Control and offering to repurchase Notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the notice,
which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed,
pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer and the
Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of the Notes and the related Note Guarantees as a result of a Change of
Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of
Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Company will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control
provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

On or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will prepay the Funding Loan to the
extent necessary to finance the repurchase by the Issuer of the Notes tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the relevant Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an
officers’ certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being
purchased by the Issuer.

The relevant Paying Agent will promptly mail to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of
Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be

120


-----

transferred by book entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased
portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new Dollar Note will be in a principal amount
of $200,000 or, if greater, an integral multiple of $1,000 and each new Euro Note will be in a principal
amount of A100,000 or, if greater, an integral multiple of A1,000.

The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a
Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable.
Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions
that permit the holders of the Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and
purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer. The Issuer
also will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if it has
theretofore issued a redemption notice in respect of all of the Notes in the manner and in accordance with
the provisions described under ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’ and thereafter purchases all of the Notes
pursuant to such notice.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the properties or assets of the Company and
its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the
phrase ‘‘substantially all’’, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a result of a
sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. In addition, it
should be noted that recent case law suggests that, in the event that incumbent directors are replaced as a
result of a contested election, issuers may nevertheless avoid triggering a change of control under a clause
similar to clause (4) of the definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’, if the outgoing directors were to approve the
new directors for the purpose of such change of control clause. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether
a Change of Control has occurred and whether a holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer
to repurchase the Notes as described above.

Subject to the covenants described below, the Company could enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations which, though not constituting a Change of Control
under the Indenture, could increase the amount of outstanding debt or otherwise affect the Company’s
capital structure or credit ratings. In addition, we may not be able to finance the payments required for a
Change of Control Offer. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks related to the notes—We may not have the ability to
raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer’’.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes for redemption as
follows:

(1) if the Notes are listed on any national securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements, if
any, of the principal national securities exchange on which the Notes are listed as certificated to
the Trustee by the Issuer; or

(2) if the Notes are not listed on any national securities exchange, then in relation to the Dollar
Notes, by lot and in relation to the Euro Notes, on a _pro rata basis, or by such method as the_
Trustee deems fair and appropriate.

No Notes may be redeemed in part such that the remainder of the Note is less than $200,000 in aggregate
principal amount in the case of Dollar Notes and less than A100,000 in aggregate principal amount in the
case of Euro Notes. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 30 but not more than
60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address,
except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is
issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.
Notices of redemption may not be conditional.

121


-----

In addition, so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
traded on the Euro MTF Market and the Rules and Regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so
require, all notices to holders of the Notes will also be supplied to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
are expected to be published at www.bourse.lu. If publication as provided above is not practicable, notice
will be given in such other manner, and shall be deemed to have been given on such date, as the Trustee
may approve. In the case of Definitive Registered Notes, notices will be mailed to holders of the Notes by
first class mail at their respective addresses as they appear on the records of the Registrar. If and so long as
the Notes are listed on any other securities exchange, notices will also be given in accordance with any
applicable requirements of such securities exchange. Notices given by publication will be deemed given on
the first date on which publication is made. Notices given by first class mail, postage paid, will be deemed
given five calendar days after mailing whether or not the addressee receives it.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the
portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal
to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Notes upon
cancellation of the original Note and will be collectible at the office of the Paying Agent. Notes called for
redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest
ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer, the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of principal of, or interest,
premium, or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes will become void unless presentation for payment is
made as required in the Indenture within a period of seven years, in the case of principal, or five years, in
the case of interest, premium or Additional Amounts, if any, from the applicable original payment date
therefor.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Restricted Payments_**

retire for value (x) any Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, the
Note Guarantees, or the Funding Loan except a payment of interest or principal at the Stated
Maturity thereof or (y) any Subordinated Shareholder Debt; or

(4) make any Restricted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in these
clauses (1) through (4) being collectively referred to as ‘‘Restricted Payments’’),

unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

(1) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence
of such Restricted Payment; and

(2) the Company would, after giving pro forma effect to such Restricted Payment (including the
application thereof) as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter period, have been permitted to incur at least A1.00 of additional

Indebtedness (other than Permitted Debt) pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set

Company or from Subordinated Shareholder Debt or Excluded Contributions), plus

(c) 100% of any dividends or distributions (including payments made in respect of loans or
advances) received by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company after the
Issue Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company or a Permitted Joint Venture, to
the extent that such dividends or distributions were not otherwise included in Consolidated
Net Income of the Company for such period (and _provided that such dividends or_
distributions are not included in the calculation of that amount of Permitted Investments
permitted under clause (12) of the definition thereof), plus

(d) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company is redesignated as a
Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date, the Fair Market Value of the Company’s
Investment in such Subsidiary as of the date of such redesignation, plus

(e) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the Issue Date is sold for
cash or otherwise liquidated or repaid for cash or Cash Equivalents (including, without
limitation, any sale for cash or other Cash Equivalents of an Equity Interest in an
Unrestricted Subsidiary), the cash return of capital with respect to such Restricted
Investment (less the cost of disposition, if any), plus

(f) 100% of the cash received by the Company since the Issue Date in connection with the
incurrence of any Subordinated Shareholder Debt.

The preceding provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend, if at the
date of declaration the dividend payment would have complied with the provisions of the
Indenture;

(2) the redemption, repurchase, retirement, defeasance or other acquisition of any subordinated
Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or of any Equity Interests of the
Company or any Parent Company by conversion into (in the case of subordinated Indebtedness)
or in exchange for, or out of the Net Cash Proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale (other
than to a Subsidiary of the Company) of, Equity Interests of the Company (other than
Disqualified Stock) or Subordinated Shareholder Debt or from the substantially concurrent

sale of, Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) or a substantially
concurrent cash capital contribution received by the Company from its shareholders; _provided,_
_however, that the Net Cash Proceeds from such sale or cash capital contribution shall be excluded_
from clause (3)(b) of the preceding paragraph;

(5) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition for value of Equity Interests of any non-Wholly

other acquisition, the Company increases its percentage ownership, directly or indirectly through
its Restricted Subsidiaries, of such non-Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary;

payment of such amount the Leverage Ratio shall be no greater than 2.5 to 1.0 and (B) 6% per
annum of the net cash proceeds received by the Company in any Public Offering or contributed

margin of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries and, to the extent of the amount actually
received from the Company’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries, in amounts required to pay such Taxes to
the extent attributable to the income of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries; provided that in each case
the amount of such payments in any fiscal year does not exceed the amount that the Company,
the Restricted Subsidiaries and the Company’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries (to the extent described
above) would be required to pay in respect of foreign, federal, state and local Taxes for such fiscal

is not a Restricted Subsidiary and such Person is subsequently designated a Restricted Subsidiary,
such Investment shall thereafter be deemed to have been made pursuant to clause (3) of the
definition of ‘‘Permitted Investments’’ and not this clause);

_provided, however, that after giving effect to any Restricted Payment referred to in clauses (5), (7), (8) or_
(14) of this paragraph, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would
occur as a consequence thereof.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of the
Restricted Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. The Fair Market Value of
any assets or securities that are required to be valued by this covenant will be determined by the
responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company. The determination of such responsible
financial or accounting officer will be final and conclusive.

**_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or
otherwise, with respect to (collectively, ‘‘incur’’) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the
Company will not issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to
issue any shares of preferred stock; provided, however, that the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary
may incur Indebtedness, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Acquired Debt and the
Company may issue Disqualified Stock and any Restricted Subsidiary may issue shares of preferred stock,
if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for
which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional
Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued would have been at least
2.5 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds
therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or preferred
stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period; _provided that a_
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is not a Guarantor or the Issuer may incur Indebtedness or
issue Disqualified Stock or preferred stock pursuant to this paragraph solely to the extent that the
Non-Guarantor Leverage Ratio for the Company’s most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which
internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such Indebtedness is
incurred or such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued, as the case may be, would have been no
greater than 0.75 to 1.00, as determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net
proceeds therefrom), as if such Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or preferred
stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence by the Company or its Restricted
Subsidiaries of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, ‘‘Permitted Debt’’):

(1) the incurrence by the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness and
letters of credit under Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount at any one time
outstanding under this clause (1) not to exceed A1,000 million;

(2) the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of the Existing Indebtedness;

assets of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Receivables that are
the subject of the factoring), or (b) if such Indebtedness has recourse to any property or assets of
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, only the portion of such Indebtedness that is
not recourse to any property or assets of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other
than Receivables that are the subject of the factoring) may be considered as ‘‘Permitted Debt’’
under this clause (13);

(14) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of guarantees of Indebtedness of
Permitted Joint Ventures in an amount not to exceed A100 million;

(15) Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock of Persons that are acquired by the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise
combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related
liabilities) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture; provided that such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock are not
incurred or issued in connection with such acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation or
other combination, and, after giving effect to such acquisition, merger, consolidation,
amalgamation or other combination, either:

(a) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary would be permitted to incur at least A1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the
first sentence, of this covenant; or

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company is no less than immediately prior to such

any time outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund,
refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (16), not to exceed
A150 million.

To the extent any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor is a joint obligor with respect to any
Indebtedness, the entire amount of such Indebtedness shall be considered Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor for purposes of this covenant.

The accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on
any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, and the payment of
dividends on Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock will
not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of
this covenant; provided that, in each such case, that the amount thereof is included in Consolidated Interest
Expense of the Company as accrued or paid in accordance with the definition of such term.

The incurrence by an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company of Non-Recourse Debt will not be deemed
to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant;
_provided,_ _however, that if any such Indebtedness ceases to be Non-Recourse Debt of such Unrestricted_
Subsidiary, such Indebtedness shall be deemed to constitute an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company that was not permitted by this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of proposed
Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in
clauses (1) through (16) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, the Company will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its
incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies
with this covenant.

**_Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien of any kind upon any of its assets or property (including

any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such
Lien, the ‘‘Initial Lien’’), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral,
(1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the
Indenture (or a Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are directly secured equally and
ratably with, or senior in right of payment to, in the case of Liens with respect to subordinated
Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured,
and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries_**

and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments, modifications,

more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions
than those contained in those agreements on the Issue Date;

acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties
or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so
acquired; _provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the_
terms of the Indenture to be incurred;

and consistent with past practices;

(6) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business that impose

Subsidiary of the Company permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to
the provisions of the covenant described under ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock’’ (i) if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any
such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the holders of
the Notes than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Credit Facilities as in
effect on the Issue Date (as determined in good faith by the Company) or (ii) if the
encumbrances and restrictions are not materially more disadvantageous to the holders of the
Notes than is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Company)
and either (x) the Company determines that such encumbrance or restriction will not adversely
affect the Company’s ability to make principal and interest payments on the Notes as and when
they come due or (y) such encumbrances and restrictions apply only during the continuance of a
default in respect of a payment or financial maintenance covenant relating to such Indebtedness,
(B) constituting an intercreditor agreement on terms substantially equivalent to the Intercreditor
Agreement or (C) relating to any loan or advance by the Company to a Restricted Subsidiary of
the Company subsequent to the Issue Date; _provided that with respect to this clause (13) the_

are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes than the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Senior Credit Facilities, the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date).

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

The Company may not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person; or
(2) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to
another Person; unless:

(1) either: (a) the Company is the surviving corporation; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any
such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made (the ‘‘Surviving Entity’’) is a corporation
organized or existing under the laws of (i) Spain, (ii) any other member of the European Union
that has adopted the euro as its national currency, (iii) the United Kingdom or (iv) the United
States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia;

(2) the Surviving Entity (if other than the Company) assumes all the obligations of the Company
under its Note Guarantee and the Funding Loan and, in each case, the Indenture, the applicable
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
pursuant to agreements satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction no Default or Event of Default exists or would
exist; and

(4) the Company or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will:

(a) on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related
financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable
four-quarter period, either (i) be permitted to incur at least A1.00 of additional Indebtedness
pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the
covenant entitled ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of

129


-----

Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock’’ or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the
Company (or, if applicable, the Surviving Entity) would equal or exceed the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio of the Company immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(b) deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, in each case,
stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and any supplemental indenture comply
with this covenant and the Indenture, and, if the Company is not the surviving entity, that the
accession agreement executed in connection therewith is the legally valid and binding
obligation of the Successor Entity enforceable (subject to customary exceptions and
exclusions) in accordance with their terms.

In addition, the Company may not, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of its properties or
assets, in one or more related transactions, to any other Person. This ‘‘—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
Assets’’ covenant will not apply to a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets
between or among the Company and any of the Guarantors. Notwithstanding clause (4)(a) of the
foregoing, the Company or any Guarantor may merge with an Affiliate solely for the purpose of
reincorporating the Company or such Guarantor in another jurisdiction to realize tax or other benefits.

A Subsidiary Guarantor may not sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or
consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person)
another Person, other than the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor, unless:

(1) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(2) either:

(a) the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or
surviving any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of that Subsidiary
Guarantor under the Indenture and its Note Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental
indenture satisfactory to the Trustee and the applicable Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(b) the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture; or

(c) in any transaction between (i) the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor and (ii) a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor is
the surviving Person or the Restricted Subsidiary is the surviving Person and assumes all of
the obligations of the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture and its
Note Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture satisfactory to the Trustee.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or
sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or
assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan,
advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate (each, an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving
aggregate payments or consideration in excess of A5 million, unless:

(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms no less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and

(2) the Company delivers to the Trustee:

(a) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of A25 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of
the Company set forth in an officers’ certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction
complies with clause (1) above; and

(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of A50 million, an opinion that such transaction or series of
transactions is fair to the holders from a financial point of view, or is not less favorable than
could reasonably be expected to be obtained at the time in an arm’s length transaction with a
Person who was not an Affiliate of the Company, which opinion shall be issued by an

130


-----

independent accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of international or national
standing.

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to
the provisions of the prior paragraph:

(a) transactions between or among (i) the Company and/or (ii) its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(b) transactions with a Person (including any joint venture or equity investee) that is an Affiliate of
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary solely because the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
owns an Equity Interest in such Person;

(c) payment of reasonable director’s and other fees to, indemnities provided on behalf of, and
expenses (including expense reimbursement, employee benefit and pension expenses) relating to,
officers, directors, employees or consultants of the Company or its Parent Company or the
Company’s Subsidiaries and payments of benefits and salaries to employees of the Company or
its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business;

(d) issuances or sales of Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) or
Subordinated Shareholder Debt to Affiliates of the Company;

(e) purchases of steel blanks, coils and other raw materials by Affiliates of the Company or its
Restricted Subsidiaries on terms reflecting current market conditions, that are no less favorable,
when taken as a whole, to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, than those
available to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from third parties;

(f) sales of scrap steel and other steel materials by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries to
Affiliates on terms reflecting current market conditions, that are no less favorable, when taken as
a whole, to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, than those available from
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary to third parties;

(g) payments pursuant to real estate leases and license agreements entered into in the ordinary
course of business and on reasonable arm’s length terms, not exceeding A5 million per annum in
the aggregate;

(h) Permitted Investments or Restricted Payments that are permitted by the provisions of the
Indenture described above under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments’’
(other than Permitted Investments described in clauses (3), (12), (13)(i), (15) and (17) of the
definition of ‘‘Permitted Investments’’); and

(i) performance of any agreement of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary as in effect on the
Issue Date and disclosed in the Listing Particulars under ‘‘Shareholders and Certain
Transactions’’ and any amendment after the Issue Date (so long as such amendment is not
disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in any material respect) to any such agreement
(except as covered by clause (h) hereof).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Equity Interests in Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale
unless:

(1) the Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time
of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Capital Stock issued or
sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the
following will be deemed to be cash:

(a) any liabilities, as shown on the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent
balance sheet, of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities
and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee) that
are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to a customary novation
agreement that releases the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from further liability;
and

131


-----

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash within 180 days of the receipt thereof, to the extent of the cash received
in that conversion.

Within 360 days after the receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Company may apply
those Net Cash Proceeds, if any, at its option:

(1) to repay, repurchase, prepay or redeem (i)(a) to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds derives from
an Asset Sale in respect of an asset which, immediately prior to such Asset Sale did not constitute
Collateral, Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (other than
Indebtedness owed to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) or Indebtedness which is
secured by a Lien on such asset or (b) Indebtedness of the Company or any other Restricted
Subsidiary incurred under Credit Facilities pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the
covenant entitled ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and
Disqualified Stock’’ that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral; _provided,_ _however, that, in_
connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this
clause (i)(a), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will
cause the related commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the
principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased, or (ii) to prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu
Indebtedness; _provided that the Company shall redeem, repay or repurchase_ _Pari Passu_
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (ii) only if the Company makes (at such time or
subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to the holders of the Notes to purchase
their Notes in accordance with the provision set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer for an
aggregate principal amount of Notes at least equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate
principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum of the total aggregate principal
amount of Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Pari
_Passu Indebtedness;_

(2) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or a majority of the Voting Stock of, another
Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted
Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) to make a capital expenditure;

(4) to acquire other long-term assets (other than Indebtedness or Capital Stock) that are used or
useful in a Permitted Business;

(5) to enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to clause (2), (3) or
(4) of this paragraph; _provided that such binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted_
application of the Net Cash Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of
(x) the date on which such acquisition or expenditure is consummated and (y) the 180th day
following the expiration of the aforementioned 360 day period; or

(6) any combination of the foregoing.

In connection with any investment in Voting Stock pursuant to clause (2) if the assets sold constituted
Collateral, the Company will also grant a pledge, or will cause a pledge to be granted, on, a senior basis
over any acquired Voting Stock in a Person incorporated in the same jurisdiction of the Person whose
Voting Stock constituted Collateral as additional Collateral. Pending the final application of any Net Cash
Proceeds, the Company may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net
Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this covenant, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to apply any
Net Cash Proceeds in accordance with this covenant except to the extent that the aggregate Net Cash
Proceeds from all Asset Sales which is not applied in accordance with this covenant exceeds A25 million.

Any Net Cash Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the preceding
paragraph will constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds.’’ When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds
A25 million, the Issuer will make an Asset Sale Offer to all holders of Notes, and the Company will make
any required offer to purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness containing similar asset sale provisions, to purchase
the maximum principal amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of
the Excess Proceeds and the Company will prepay the Funding Loan to the extent necessary to finance the
repurchase of the Notes by the Issuer. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of

132


-----

principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, and will be payable in cash. If
any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company may use those
Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal
amount of Notes and other _Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the_
amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee will select the Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness to be
purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer the amount of Excess Proceeds
will be reset at zero.

The Issuer and the Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable
in connection with each repurchase of Notes and the related Note Guarantees pursuant to an Asset Sale
Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their respective obligations under the Asset Sale
provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the Company or, if required by applicable law, the shareholders of the Company
may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not
cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair
Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the
Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of such designation and
will either reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of the covenant
entitled ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments’’ or reduce the amount available for future
Investments under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as the Company shall
determine. That designation will only be permitted if such Investment would be permitted at that time and
if such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Board of
Directors of the Company or, if required by applicable law, the shareholders of the Company may
redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause
a Default.

**_Additional Note Guarantees_**

The Company shall cause any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is or becomes a Material
Subsidiary (except for any Restricted Subsidiary which was a Material Subsidiary at the Issue Date but was
not an initial Subsidiary Guarantor, any Restricted Subsidiary that is already a Guarantor, or any
Restricted Subsidiary as to which the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries do not own, directly or
indirectly, greater than 90% of the Capital Stock) to execute and deliver a supplemental indenture
providing for the Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms as the Note Guarantees
granted by the other Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and traded on
the Euro MTF Market, the Issuer will publish a notice of such additional guarantees in accordance with
the requirements of such rules.

The Company will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to guarantee the
payment of any other Credit Facilities or other Public Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor unless such
incurrence is permitted by the covenant entitled ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock’’, and such Restricted Subsidiary (if not already a
Subsidiary Guarantor) simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture and supplemental
intercreditor agreement pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the Notes
on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and which Note Guarantee will be senior to or _pari passu with such_
Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Credit Facilities or other Public Debt; _provided that no_
such additional Note Guarantee need be provided in respect of Credit Facilities or other Public Debt of
the Issuer or any Guarantor (i) that does not exceed A25 million, in the aggregate with all other Credit
Facilities or other Public Debt described under this clause (i), (ii) if the guarantee of such Indebtedness is
pursuant to a regulatory requirement and such Credit Facilities or other Public Debt is owed to a
regulatory body, or (iii) if such Credit Facilities or other Public Debt is guaranteed by such Restricted
Subsidiary on the Issue Date and such Restricted Subsidiary is not a Guarantor.

133


-----

The Company shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes to the
extent that (A) such Note Guarantee could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any
violation of applicable law that cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably
available to the Company, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (2) any liability for the officers, directors or
shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary; (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including any Tax)
other than reasonable out of pocket expenses and other than reasonable governmental or regulatory filing
fees and (4) a requirement under applicable law, rule or regulation to obtain or prepare financial
statements or financial information of such Person to be included in any required filing with a legal or
regulatory authority that the Company is not able to obtain or prepare through measures reasonably
available to the Company or (B) (i) such Restricted Subsidiary is incorporated in any jurisdiction located in
North America or South America, (ii) such Restricted Subsidiary is a Subsidiary of any Person described
under clause (i) above, or (iii) such Restricted Subsidiary is incorporated in Japan, China, South Korea,
India or Taiwan.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this covenant, any Note Guarantee by a Restricted
Subsidiary will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged when (i) the Indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to guarantee the Notes is discharged,
(ii) in the case of any Note Guarantee granted as contemplated under the third paragraph of this covenant
as a result of a Restricted Subsidiary guaranteeing other Credit Facilities or Public Debt, when such other
Indebtedness is released and discharged, or (iii) otherwise under the circumstances described above under
the caption ‘‘—Brief Description of the Notes, the Funding Loan, the Note Guarantees and the
Intercreditor Agreement—The Note Guarantees.’’ The terms, provisions and limitations related to the
Note Guarantees will be included in the Indenture.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company shall not and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action
that would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it
being understood that the incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be
deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the
Trustee and the holders of the Notes, and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the
holders of the Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, any interest
whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that the Company and is Restricted Subsidiaries may incur
Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred or released in accordance
with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement provided, however,
that (a) nothing in this provision shall restrict the release or replacement of any security interests in
compliance with the terms of the Indenture as described under ‘‘—Security—Release of Security Interests’’
and (b) any Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified or replaced, if contemporaneously with any such action, the Company delivers to the Trustee,
either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an
independent financial advisor confirming the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant
Person which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such security interest after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or
release and replacement, or (3) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the
security so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens, in
each case, not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at
law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement. In the event that the Company
complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and/or the Security Agent (as the case may
be) shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to any such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement without the need for
instructions from the holders of the Notes.

134


-----

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer will not engage in any business activity or undertake any other activity, except any activity
(a) relating to the offering, sale or issuance of the Notes, Indebtedness under Credit Facilities, other Public
Debt and Hedging Obligations or the incurrence of Indebtedness by the Issuer represented by the Notes,
Indebtedness under Credit Facilities, other Public Debt and Hedging Obligations, (b) undertaken with the
purpose of, and directly related to, fulfilling its obligations under the Notes or the Indenture, other Public
Debt and Hedging Obligations (including the lending of the proceeds from the Notes, Indebtedness under
Credit Facilities or other Public Debt to the Company or another Guarantor pursuant to a Funding Loan
or similar loan or loans and granting Liens in respect of such loans to secure Indebtedness), or (c) directly
related to the establishment and maintenance of the Issuer’s corporate existence or (d) reasonably related
to the foregoing. The Issuer shall not (a) incur any Indebtedness (except to the Company or a Wholly
Owned Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) other than the Notes, Indebtedness under Credit Facilities,
other Public Debt and Hedging Obligations, or (b) issue any Capital Stock (other than to the Company or
a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary of the Company), or (c) undertake any transaction that will require
the Issuer to register as an ‘‘investment company’’ or an entity ‘‘controlled by an investment company’’ as
defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

The Issuer and the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or any other Person
that is an obligor under the Funding Loan, to (i) sell, dispose, encumber, prepay, repay, repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire, reduce or retire any amounts outstanding under the Funding Loan except in
connection with a redemption of outstanding Notes in a manner permitted by the Indenture, or (ii) amend,
modify, supplement or waive any rights under the Funding Loan in a manner that would adversely affect
the rights of the Issuer or its creditors with respect to the Funding Loan.

**_Suspension of Certain Covenants when Notes Rated Investment Grade_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, (1) the Notes are rated (a) Baa3 or better by Moody’s and
(b) BBB� or better by S&P (or, if either Moody’s or S&P ceases to rate the Notes for reasons outside of
the control of the Issuer or the Company, the equivalent investment grade credit rating from Fitch or, in
the absence of such, any other ‘‘nationally recognized statistical rating organization’’ within the meaning of
Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Issuer or the Company as a replacement
agency so that the Notes are so rated by at least two such credit rating agencies); and (2) no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then, beginning on that day and subject to the
provisions of the following paragraph, the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in
these Listing Particulars will be suspended and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture
will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries:

(1) ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments’’;

(2) ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and
Disqualified Stock’’;

(3) ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries’’;

(4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’;

(5) ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Transactions with Affiliates’’;

(6) ‘‘—Certain Covenants—’’Limitation on Sales of Assets and Equity Interests in Restricted
Subsidiaries’’; and

(7) ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees’’.

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Company’s Board of Directors
may not designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the covenant described
below under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’
or the second paragraph of the definition of ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary’’.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such rating agency should subsequently decline
to below Baa3 or BBB�, as applicable, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as of and from the date
of such rating decline. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with respect to actions properly
taken during the period of suspension. Calculations under the reinstated ‘‘Restricted Payments’’ covenant

135


-----

will be made as if the ‘‘Restricted Payments’’ covenant had been in effect since the Issue Date except that
no default will be deemed to have occurred by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant
was suspended. On the rating decline date, all Indebtedness incurred during the suspension period will be
classified, at the Issuer’s option, as having been incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred
Stock and Disqualified Stock’’ or one or more of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such
covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be incurred thereunder as of the rating
decline date and after giving effect to Indebtedness incurred prior to the suspension period and
outstanding on the rating decline date). To the extent that such Indebtedness would be so permitted to be
incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock’’, such Indebtedness
will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified under clause (2) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock’’.

**_Reports_**

The Company will post on its website and furnish to the Trustee and holders the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Company’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2013, annual reports containing a level of detail that is comparable in all material
respects to the Listing Particulars and the following information: (a) audited consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited
consolidated income statements and cash flow of the Company for the three most recent fiscal
years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, and the report of the
independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) pro forma income statement and balance
sheet information, together with summary explanatory footnotes, for any acquisitions or
dispositions that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as
to which such annual report relates if the consolidated revenues, EBITDA or assets of the Person
to which such acquisition or disposition relates, represent greater than 20% of the consolidated
revenues, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a pro forma basis or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal
year as to which such annual report relates, in each case unless pro forma information has been
provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) below (provided that an acquisition,
disposition or recapitalization that has occurred fewer than 30 days prior to the last day of the
completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates shall be reported in the next interim
report provided pursuant to this covenant); (c) to the extent relating to annual periods, an
operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the
results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of
material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; (d) a description of the
business, management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions and a
description of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; and
(e) material risk factors and material recent developments (provided that, in the case of cash flow
numbers, these need only be provided as an audited footnote to the financial statements referred
to above);

(2) within 60 days (or in the case of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2013, 90 days) following the
end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Company all quarterly financial
statements containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and
cash flow for the most recent quarter year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed
balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods, together with condensed footnote
disclosure; (b) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information, together with
summary explanatory footnotes, for any acquisitions or dispositions that have occurred since the
beginning of the most recently completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly report relates
if the consolidated revenues, EBITDA or assets of the Person to which such acquisition or
disposition relates, represent greater than 20% of the consolidated revenues, EBITDA or assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a pro forma basis or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly
report relates, in each case unless pro forma information has been provided in a previous report

136


-----

pursuant to clause (1) or (2) below (provided that an acquisition, disposition or recapitalization
that has occurred fewer than 30 days prior to the last day of the completed fiscal quarter as to
which such quarterly report relates shall be reported in the next interim report provided pursuant
to this covenant); (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements,
including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital
resources, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting
policies; and (d) material recent developments and any material changes to the risk factors
disclosed in the most recent annual report; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material acquisition, disposition, restructuring, senior
management or board of directors changes or change in auditors, a report containing a
description of such event.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared on a consistent basis for the
periods presented and the financial statements required under clause (1) may be presented in the same
format as in the Listing Particulars; _provided,_ _however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and_
(3) above may, in the event of a change in applicable International Financial Reporting Standards, present
earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods, subject to the provisions of the Indenture. No report
need include separate financial statements or financial data for any Guarantors or non-guarantor
Subsidiaries of the Company; provided that the annual report in clause (1) shall include a statement of the
aggregate percentage of the consolidated EBITDA of the Company represented by the Subsidiary
Guarantors.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and
annual financial information required by the preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed
presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and in the operating
and financial review of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Company.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Company is
not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b),
the Company will furnish to the holders, upon their request, the information required to be delivered
pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

**Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

At the request of the Issuer, in connection with the incurrence by the Company or its Restricted
Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness permitted to be secured under the Indenture, the Company, the Issuer,
the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of
such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an ‘‘Additional
_Intercreditor Agreement’’) on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not_
materially less favorable to the holders (provided that the Trustee and the Security Agent shall have
received an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to that effect)); provided that such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or,
in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as the case may be, under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement.

At the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall
from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of
Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be incurred by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior
in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make
provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes or other Indebtedness
permitted to be secured by the Indenture or (6) make any other change to any such agreement that does
not adversely affect the holders in any material respect (provided that the Trustee and the Security Agent
shall have received an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to that effect). The Issuer may only
direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does

137


-----

not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent, in the opinion of the Trustee or
the Security Agent, or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under the
Indenture, any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Each holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and
conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then
entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein).

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following is an Event of Default:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on, or Additional Amounts with respect
to, the Notes;

(2) default in payment when due at maturity, upon redemption, upon repurchase, upon declaration
or otherwise, of the principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to comply with the provisions
described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’;

(4) failure by the Issuer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for 30 days after written notice to
comply with the provisions described under the captions ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants’’ (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Notes which
will constitute an Event of Default under clause (2) above and a failure to comply with the
provisions described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
Assets’’ described in clause (3) above);

(5) failure by the Issuer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for 60 days after written notice to
comply with any of the other agreements in the Indenture;

(6) default under any mortgage, Indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is
created after the Issue Date, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on such Indebtedness
prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such
default (a ‘‘Payment Default’’); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity;

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates A25 million or more;

(7) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final judgments (which are not
covered by insurance as to which a claim has been submitted and the insurer has not disclaimed
or indicated an intent to disclaim responsibility for the payment thereof) aggregating in excess of
A25 million, which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days;

(8) except as permitted by the Indenture, any Note Guarantee of the Company or any Significant
Subsidiary of the Notes shall be held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or
shall cease for any reason to be in full force and effect or any Guarantor shall deny or disaffirm in
writing its obligations under its Note Guarantee;

(9) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the relevant Security Documents, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) for any reason other than
satisfaction in full of all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the Indenture or
the release of any such security interest in accordance with the Security Documents, the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or the
Indenture or any security interest created pursuant to the Indenture and the Security Documents
shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Company shall assent in writing that any such

138


-----

security interest is invalid or unenforceable or any pledgor disaffirms in writing its obligations
under the Security Documents and any such Default continues for 10 days;

(10) default under any other Indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral if such default results in
the creditors under such Indebtedness commencing an enforcement action of their security rights
over the Collateral; and

(11) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to
the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will
become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to
certain limitations, holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the
Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from holders notice of any
continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a
Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest, or Additional Amounts.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the
Trustee may on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and
its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of
interest or Additional Amounts on, or the principal of, the Notes.

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the
Indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default that would give either the Trustee or
the holders of at least 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding the right to
declare the Notes immediately due and payable, the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee a statement
specifying such Default or Event of Default.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer, the Company or any other
Guarantor, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer, the Company or the other
Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture or the Note Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder by accepting a Note waives and releases
all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver
may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws of the United States.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Issuer may, at its option or the option of the Company, and at any time, elect to have all of its
obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes and all obligations of the Company and any
other Guarantors discharged with respect to their Note Guarantees (‘‘Legal Defeasance’’) except for:

(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or
interest or premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on such Notes when such payments are due
from the trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office
or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s, the Company’s
and any other Guarantor’s obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

139


-----

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option or the option of the Company, and at any time, elect to have the
obligations of the Issuer, the Company and any other Guarantors released with respect to certain
covenants that are described in the Indenture (‘‘Covenant Defeasance’’) and thereafter any omission to
comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In
the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including non-payment, bankruptcy,
receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events) described under ‘‘—Events of Default and Remedies’’
will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited with the Trustee, in trust, for the
benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. Dollars, non-callable U.S. Government
Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. Dollars and non-callable U.S. Government Securities
(in the case of the Dollar Notes) and cash in euros, non-callable European Government
Obligations, or a combination of cash in euros and non-callable European Government
Obligations (in the case of the Euro Notes), in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of an
internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or
interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the outstanding Notes on the stated
maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify
whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (a) the Issuer has received from, or there
has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the Issue
Date, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect
that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding
Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such
Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not
occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the holders of the outstanding Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such
Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such
Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit (other
than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such
deposit);

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to
which the Issuer, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which the
Issuer, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is bound;

(6) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an officers’ certificate stating that the deposit was not made
or caused to be made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders over the other
creditors of the Issuer or of the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or
defrauding creditors of the Issuer or the Company or others; and

(7) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees,
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents may be
amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of,
or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing default or compliance with any provision of

140


-----

the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Security Documents may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). For so long as the Notes are
listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and traded on the Euro MTF Market and
the rules of this exchange so require, the Issuer will inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and publish a
notice of any such amendment, supplement or waiver in a newspaper having a general circulation in
Luxembourg (currently expected to be the _Luxemburger Wort) or the website of the Luxembourg Stock_
Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

Without the consent of holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding
Notes affected (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes), an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes
held by a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement
or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with
respect to the redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described
above under the captions ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—

(1) either:

(a) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been

**Concerning the Trustee**

If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer, the Company or any other Guarantor, the Indenture limits
its right to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of
any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions;
however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign. If the
Trustee becomes the owner or pledgee of the Notes it may deal with the Issuer with the same rights it
would have if it were not the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar or such other agent.

The holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct
the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the
Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a
prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. The Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only
such duties as are specifically set forth in the Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations can be
read into the Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its
rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder has offered
to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

**Judgment Currency**

Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in U.S. Dollars, with respect to the Dollar Notes,
and euros, with respect to the Euro Notes (each a ‘‘Required Currency’’) which is made to or for the
account of any holder of a Note in lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the ‘‘Other Currency’’) whether
as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the realization of any security or the
liquidation of any of the Issuer, Company or any other Guarantor shall constitute a discharge of the
Issuer’s, Company’s or such Guarantor’s obligation under the Indenture, the Notes or, the Note
Guarantees, as the case may be, only to the extent of the amount of the Required Currency which such
holder could purchase in the New York foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Other Currency
in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first day (other
than a Saturday or Sunday) on which banks in New York, are generally open for business following receipt
of the payment first referred to above. If the amount of the Required Currency that could be so purchased
is less than the amount of the Required Currency originally due to such holder, the Issuer, Company or
such other Guarantor, as the case may be, shall indemnify and save harmless such holder from and against
all loss or damage arising out of or as a result of such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an
obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in the Indenture, the Notes or
the Note Guarantees, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective
of any indulgence granted by any holder of a Note from time to time and shall continue in full force and
effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder
or under any judgment or order.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor will appoint Gestamp Automoci´on, 2701
Troy Center Drive, Suite 150, Troy, MI 48084, USA as its agent for service of process in any suit, action or
proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees brought in any federal or
state court located in the City of New York and will submit to such jurisdiction.

registered office of the Issuer and at the offices of the Paying Agent, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch

The Euro notes issued to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities
Act) in reliance on Rule 144A (the ‘‘Rule 144A Euro Global Notes’’) and the Dollar notes issued to
qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A (the ‘‘Rule 144A Dollar Global Notes’’ and together
with the Rule 144A Euro Global Notes the ‘‘Rule 144A Global Notes’’) will in each case be represented by
one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached and the Euro notes issued
to non-US persons outside the Unites States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (the
‘‘Regulation S Euro Global Notes’’) and the Dollar notes issued to non-US persons outside the United
States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (the ‘‘Regulation S Dollar Global Notes’’
and together with the Regulation S Euro Global Notes the ‘‘Regulation S Global Notes’’) will initially in
each case be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached. The Rule 144A Euro Global Notes together with the Regulation S Euro Global Notes are
collectively referred to as the ‘‘Euro Global Notes’’. The Rule 144A Dollar Global Notes together with the
Regulation S Dollar Global Notes are collectively referred to as the ‘‘Dollar Global Notes’’ The Rule 144A
Global Notes together with the Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to as the ‘‘Global
Notes’’. The Euro Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary, and registered in the name of
the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. The Dollar Global
Notes will be deposited with a custodian for, and registered in the name of, Cede & Co. as nominee for
DTC.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the ‘‘Restricted Book-Entry Interests’’) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the ‘‘Unrestricted Book-Entry Interests’’ and,
together with the Restricted Book-Entry Interests, the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons
that have accounts with Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC or persons that hold interests through such
participants.

Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants
through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective
depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, notes will not be issued in definitive
form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained by Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including some states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical
delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own,
transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the notes are in global form, holders of
Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or ‘‘holders’’ of notes for any purpose.

So long as the notes are held in global form, Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC, as applicable, will be
considered the sole holder(s) of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture governing the
notes. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC and
indirect participants must rely on the procedures of the participants through which they own Book-Entry
Interests to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture governing the
notes. Neither we nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records
relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any,
interest and Additional Amounts, if any) will be made by us to the common depositary or its nominee for
Euroclear and Clearstream (in the case of the Euro Global Notes) and to DTC or its nominee (in the case
of the Dollar Global Notes). The common depositary or its nominee will distribute such payments to
participants in accordance with their procedures. Payments of all such amounts will be made without
deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature except as may be required by law. If any such deduction or
withholding is required to be made by any applicable law or regulation of Luxembourg or otherwise as
described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts’’, then, to the extent described under
‘‘Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts’’, such Additional Amounts will be paid as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of

164


-----

Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or
owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case
may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that payments by participants to owners of
Book-Entry Interests held through those participants will be governed by standing customer instructions
and customary practices. Under the terms of the Indenture governing the notes, we and the Trustee will
treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (e.g. Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC (or their respective
nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, neither we, the Trustee nor any of our or the Trustee’s agents have or will have any
responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC or of any participant or indirect
participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest;

(2) Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC or any participant or indirect participant; or

(3) the records of the common depositary.

**Currency of payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Euro
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream in Euros.
The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Dollar
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through DTC in U.S. dollars.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal
amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear,
Clearstream and DTC will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of
any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes,
Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered
Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of
notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell notes to
persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder
of notes must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of
Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture
governing the notes.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed
under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’.

Transfer of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of any
Unrestricted Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture governing the notes) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry
Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note,
and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures

-----

applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry
Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the notes, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive
Definitive Registered Notes only:

(1) if Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act and a
successor is not appointed by us within 90 days; or

(2) if Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC so requests following an Event of Default under the Indenture
governing the notes.

**Information concerning Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC**

_Euroclear and Clearstream_

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry
changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among
other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded
securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic
securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters,
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to
Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies
that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with Euroclear or Clearstream participants, either
directly or indirectly.

_DTC_

DTC is a:

- limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law;

- ‘‘banking organization’’ under the New York Banking Law;

- member of the Federal Reserve System;

- ‘‘clearing corporation’’ within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

- ‘‘clearing agency’’ registered under Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
‘‘US Exchange Act’’).

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of
securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates.
DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and
certain other organizations such as the initial purchaser. Others, such as banks, brokers, dealers, trust
companies and clearing corporations, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct
participant also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants.

Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and
certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities
that do not participate in the DTC system or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest may be
limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that
certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer
beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the
DTC system will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Note only through DTC
participants.

The address of DTC in New York is DTCC, Brooklyn Army Terminal, 3H Underwriting Department,
140 58th Street, Brooklyn, New York 11220.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Global Notes, cross-market transfers
between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream Banking participants, on the one hand, and DTC on the
other hand, will be done through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of each of Euroclear or
Clearstream Banking by the common depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require
delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream Banking by the counterparty in such system in
accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such
system. Euroclear or Clearstream Banking will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements,
delivery instructions to the common depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by
delivering or receiving interests in the Global Notes in DTC, and making or receiving payment in
accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear
participants and Clearstream Banking participants may not deliver instructions directly to the common
depositary.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream Banking participant
purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting
will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream Banking participant, during the securities
settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, as the case
may be) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received in Euroclear and Clearstream
Banking as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream Banking
participant to a participant in DTC will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be
available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream Banking cash account only as of the business day for
Euroclear or Clearstream Banking following DTC’s settlement date.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking are expected to follow the foregoing procedures in
order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream Banking, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform
such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of the Issuers, the Trustee or
any Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream
Banking or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the
rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Trustee’s Powers**

In considering the interests of the holders of the notes, while title to the notes is registered in the name of a
nominee for a clearing system, the Trustee may have regard to any information provided to it by that
clearing system as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its accountholders with entitlements
to notes and may consider such interests as if such accountholders were the holders of the notes.

**Enforcement**

For the purposes of enforcement of the provisions of the Indenture governing the notes against the
Trustee, the persons named in a certificate of the holder of the notes in respect of which a Global Note is
issued shall be recognized as the beneficiaries of the trusts set out in the Indenture governing the notes to
the extent of the principal amounts of their interests in notes set out in the certificate of the holder, as if
they were themselves the holders of notes in such principal amounts.

**TAXATION**

_If you are a prospective investor, you should consult your tax advisor on the possible tax consequences of buying,_
_holding or selling any notes under the laws of your country of citizenship, residence or domicile, including the_
_effect of any local taxes applicable to you. The discussions that follow do not purport to be a comprehensive_
_description of all tax considerations which may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold or sell notes. In_
_particular, these discussions do not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to you. The_
_discussions that follow for each jurisdiction are based upon the applicable laws and interpretations thereof as in_
_effect as of May 2, 2012. These tax laws and interpretations are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or_
_retrospective effect._

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders**

**To ensure compliance with Internal Revenue Service Circular 230, you are hereby notified that any**
**discussion of tax matters set forth in these listing particulars was written in connection with the promotion**
**or marketing of the transactions or matters addressed herein and was not intended or written to be used,**
**and cannot be used, by any prospective investor, for the purpose of avoiding tax-related penalties under U.S.**
**federal tax law. Each prospective investor should seek advice based on its particular circumstances from an**
**independent tax advisor.**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership
and disposition of notes as of the date hereof. This summary deals only with notes that are held as capital
assets by a U.S. holder (as defined below) who acquired our notes upon original issuance at their ‘‘issue
price’’ (the first price at which a substantial amount of notes is sold to investors for cash, not including sales
to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters,
placement agents or wholesalers).

For purposes of this summary, a ‘‘U.S. holder’’ means a person that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes
any of the following:

- an individual who is a citizen or resident of the U.S.;

- a corporation created or organized under the laws of the U.S., any state thereof or the District of
Columbia;

- an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

- a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the U.S. and one or more U.S.
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in
effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’),
and applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those
authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences
different from those summarized below. This summary does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income
taxes, does not address any U.S. federal taxes other than U.S. federal income taxes (such as estate or gift
taxes or the Medicare tax on certain investment income) and does not deal with any foreign, state, local or
other tax considerations that may be relevant to U.S. holders in light of their particular circumstances. In
addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences
applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws. For
example, this summary does not address:

- tax consequences to holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as dealers in securities
or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their
securities, financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,
partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, tax-exempt entities
or insurance companies;

- tax consequences to persons holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or
conversion transaction or a straddle;

- tax consequences to holders of the notes whose ‘‘functional currency’’ is not the U.S. dollar; or

- alternative minimum tax consequences, if any.

168


-----

If an entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our notes, the tax
treatment of a partner in such a partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership considering an investment in our notes,
you should consult your own tax advisors.

**If you are considering the purchase of notes, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the**
**particular U.S. federal tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes, as**
**well as the consequences to you arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**_Payments of Interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below with respect to the Euro notes, interest will generally
be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your regular
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition to interest on the notes (without
reduction for any tax withheld from the interest payments you receive), you will be required to include in
income any Additional Amounts paid in respect of such tax withheld.

You may be entitled to deduct or credit any tax withheld, subject to certain limitations (including that the
election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax
year). Interest on a note (including any Additional Amounts, whether paid on the Dollar notes or the Euro
notes), generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit,
generally will be considered passive category income or, in the case of certain U.S. holders, general
category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to
the notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not
protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to
consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular
circumstances.

If you hold Euro notes and you use the cash basis method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro
interest payment, determined by translating the euros received at the ‘‘spot rate’’ in effect on the date of
receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize
foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest but you may have
exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros so received.

If you hold Euro notes and you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to the euro interest payment in
accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income
(as ordinary income) for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the euro-denominated interest that has
accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate
of exchange for the period or periods (or portions thereof) in such taxable year during which such interest
accrued. Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot
rate on (i) the last day of the interest accrual period, (ii) the last day of the taxable year for any portion of
any accrual period ending on the last day of such taxable year, or (iii) the date the interest payment is
received, if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. This election will apply to
all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the Internal
Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’).

Upon receipt of an interest payment on a Euro note (including amounts received upon the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note attributable to accrued but unpaid interest),
a U.S. holder using the accrual method will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss, generally
treated as ordinary income or loss, in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar
value of such payment (determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate in effect on the date
of receipt) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest previously included in income with respect to such
payment, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time. Any such
foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated, for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, as
U.S. source ordinary income or loss, and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income
or expense.

169


-----

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note, you generally will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued but
unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included in income)
and your adjusted tax basis in the note.

Your initial tax basis in a Dollar note will generally be your cost for the note. Your initial tax basis in a Euro
note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros paid for such note determined at the spot rate at
the time of purchase. If your note is sold, exchanged, retired, redeemed or otherwise disposed of in a
taxable transaction for euros, then your amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros
received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or
other taxable disposition. However, if you are a cash method taxpayer and the notes are traded on an
established securities market, euros paid or received will be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on
the settlement date of the purchase or sale. An accrual method taxpayer may elect the same treatment with
respect to the purchase or sale of notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the
election is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by such U.S. holder. Such election cannot be
changed without the consent of the IRS.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, any gain or loss recognized will generally be capital
gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition, you have held the note for more than one year. Capital gains of
non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) derived with respect to capital assets held for more than
one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations. Any gain or loss realized by you on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a note would generally be treated as U.S. source gain or loss.

A portion of any gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Euro note may be treated as
exchange gain or loss. Any exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally
will be U.S. source gain or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. For these purposes, the principal
amount of the Euro note is your purchase price for the Euro note calculated in euros on the date of
purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference, if any, between
(i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Euro note and (ii) the U.S. dollar
value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date you purchased the Euro note (or,
possibly, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement dates of such purchase
and taxable disposition, if the note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal
income tax purposes). The amount of exchange gain or loss will be limited to the amount of overall gain or
loss realized on the disposition of the note.

**_Exchange Gain or Loss with Respect to Foreign Currency_**

Your tax basis in any euro received as interest on or on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other
taxable disposition of a note will be the U.S. dollar value thereof at the spot rate in effect on the date the
euros are received. As discussed above, if the notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash
basis U.S. holder (or, upon election, an accrual basis U.S. holder) will determine the U.S. dollar value of
the euros by translating the euros received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. Accordingly, your tax basis in the euros
received would be equal to the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date.

Any gain or loss recognized by you on a sale, exchange or other disposition of a euro will be ordinary
income or loss and generally will be U.S. source gain or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

U.S. Treasury regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter
transactions could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including
certain foreign currency transactions. Under the U.S. Treasury regulations, certain transactions are
required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect
of a foreign currency note to the extent that such sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable

170


-----

disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. If you are considering the purchase of a
Euro note, you should consult your own tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with
respect to an investment in the Euro notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable
Transaction Disclosure Statement) as part of your U.S. federal income tax return.

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Generally, information reporting requirements will apply to all payments of interest on and the proceeds
from a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other disposition of a note paid to you, unless you are an
exempt recipient (such as a corporation). Additionally, if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification
number or to certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, you may be subject to backup
withholding with respect to the foregoing amounts.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
generally will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, if any,
provided the required information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

**_Foreign Financial Asset Reporting_**

Certain U.S. holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the notes, subject to
certain exceptions (including an exception for notes held in accounts maintained by U.S. financial
institutions), by attaching a complete IRS Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets,
with their tax return for each year in which they hold an interest in the notes. You are urged to consult your
own tax advisors regarding information reporting requirements relating to your ownership of the notes,
including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**Taxation in the Kingdom of Spain**

The information provided below does not purport to be a complete analysis of the tax law and practice
currently applicable in Spain and does not purport to address the tax consequences applicable to all
categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special rules.

Prospective purchasers of the notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax
consequences, including those under the tax laws of the country of which they are resident, of purchasing,
owning and disposing of notes.

This tax section is based on Spanish law as in effect on May 2, 2013 as well as on administrative
interpretation thereof, and is subject to any change in such law that may take effect after such date.

This information has been prepared in accordance with the following Spanish tax legislation in force on
May 2, 2013:

(i) for individuals resident for tax purposes in Spain who beneficially own the notes which are subject
to the Individual Income Tax (‘‘IIT’’), Law 35/2006 of November 28 on the IIT Law and on the
partial amendment of the Corporate Income Tax Law, the Non-Resident Income Tax Law and
the Net Wealth Tax Law, as amended, and Royal Decree 439/2007 of March 30, promulgating the
IIT Regulations;

(ii) for legal entities resident for tax purposes in Spain who beneficially own the notes which are
subject to the Corporate Income Tax (‘‘CIT’’), Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004 of March 5
promulgating the Consolidated Text of the CIT Law, as amended, and Royal Decree 1777/2004 of
July 30 promulgating the CIT Regulations; and

(iii) for non-Spanish tax residents investors acting through a permanent establishment in Spain who
beneficially own the notes which are subject to the Non-Resident Income Tax (‘‘NRIT’’), Royal
Legislative Decree 5/2004 of March 5 promulgating the Consolidated Text of the NRIT Law, as
amended, and Royal Decree 1776/2004 of July 30 promulgating the NRIT Regulations.

Whatever the nature and residence of the noteholder, the acquisition and transfer of notes will be exempt
from indirect taxes in Spain, _i.e., exempt from Transfer Tax and Stamp Duty, in accordance with the_
Consolidated Text of such tax promulgated by Royal Legislative Decree 1/1993 of September 24 and
exempt from Value Added Tax, in accordance with Law 37/1992 of December 28 regulating such tax.

171


-----

For the purposes of this section we have assumed that the Issuer is a company resident for tax purposes in
Luxembourg, that it will be entitled to obtain the corresponding tax residence certificate and that it does
not perform its activity through a permanent establishment located within the Spanish territory.

**_Individuals with Tax Residency in Spain_**

_Individual Income Tax (Impuesto sobre la Renta de las Personas F´ısicas)_

Both interest periodically received and income derived from the transfer, redemption or repayment of the
notes constitute a return on investment obtained from the transfer of a person’s own capital to third parties
in accordance with the provisions of Section 25.2 of the IIT Law, and must be included in the investor’s
IIT savings taxable base and taxed, currently, at a flat rate of 21% on the first A6,000, 25% on the following
A18,000 and 27% for any amount in excess of A24,000.

If the notes are deposited with or managed by a financial institution resident in Spain, or acting through a
permanent establishment in Spain, in accordance with the Spanish tax laws in force, such financial
institution, acting as depositary or manager of such notes, will be responsible for making the relevant
Spanish withholding on account of tax on any payment to a Spanish holder deriving from the notes
(currently at a rate of 21%). In this case, the Spanish holder may credit the withholding against his or her
final IIT liability for the relevant tax year.

_Net Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)_

Reestablishment of the Net Wealth Tax (NWT), which was originally foreseen for years 2011 and 2012, has
been also extended for year 2013 by virtue of Law 16/2012, of December 27[th].

In general terms, for tax year 2013, Spanish resident tax individuals are subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax
(Spanish Law 19/1991), which imposes a tax on property and rights in excess of A700,000 held at
December 31[st] for each year.. Spanish tax resident individuals whose net worth is above A700,000 and who
hold Notes on the last day of any year would therefore be subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax for such year
at marginal rates varying between 0.2% and 2.5% of the average market value of the notes during the last
quarter of such year.

Notwithstanding the above, Spanish regions are authorized to set their own tax rates and allowances and
also to modify the minimum tax exemption. Therefore, an analysis must be made in each specific case to
determine to what extent any regional legislation might be applicable, since there might be differences
depending on the region in which an investor resides.

_Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)_

Individuals who are resident in Spain for tax purposes who acquire ownership or other rights over any
notes by inheritance, gift or legacy will be subject to the Spanish Inheritance and Gift Tax (IGT) in
accordance with the applicable Spanish regional and state rules. The applicable tax rates range between
7.65% and 81.6% for 2013, depending on relevant factors.

It is necessary to take into account that the IGT is a tax, in some relevant aspects (including certain tax
benefits), which has been transferred to the Spanish regions and, following this power, some territories
have, in practice, eliminated the taxation.

Then, a particular analysis should be made in each specific case since there might be relevant differences
_vis-a-vis the tax treatment above summarized._

**_Legal Entities with Tax Residency in Spain_**

_Corporate Income Tax (Impuesto sobre Sociedades)_

Both interest periodically received and income derived from the transfer, redemption or repayment of the
notes are subject to CIT (at the current general flat tax rate of 30% for 2013) in accordance with the rules
for this tax.

Notwithstanding the above, to the extent that the notes were traded on an OECD country organized
market, no withholding tax on account of Spanish taxes will be levied in Spain arising from the notes.
However, the financial institution (if tax resident in Spain or acting through a permanent establishment in
Spain) acting as a paying agent or intervening in the transfer, redemption or repayment of the notes will be
obliged to provide some information to the Spanish Tax Authorities.

172


-----

_Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)_

Legal entities resident in Spain for tax purposes which acquire ownership or other rights over the notes by
inheritance, gift or legacy are not subject to the Spanish Inheritance and Gift Tax but must include the
market value of the notes in their taxable income for CIT purposes.

**_Non-Tax Residents in Spain acting through a permanent establishment in Spain_**

If the notes form part of the assets of a permanent establishment in Spain of a person or legal entity who is
not resident in Spain for tax purposes, the tax rules applicable to income deriving from such notes are,
generally, the same as those set out above for Spanish CIT taxpayers. See ‘‘—Legal Entities with Tax
Residency in Spain—Corporate Income Tax (Impuesto sobre Sociedades).’’ Ownership of the notes by
investors who are not resident in Spain for tax purposes will not in itself create the existence of a
permanent establishment in Spain.

**Luxembourg Taxation**

The following is a summary of certain Luxembourg tax considerations applicable to certain holders of the
notes. This information is of a general nature only and does not purport to be a comprehensive description
of all tax implications that might be relevant to an investment decision. It is included herein solely for
preliminary information purposes. It is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax
advice. It is a description of the essential material Luxembourg tax consequences with respect to the notes
and may not include tax considerations that arise from rules of general application or that are generally
assumed to be known by holders of the notes. This summary is based on the laws in force in Luxembourg
law on May 2, 2013 and is subject to any change in law that may take effect after such date. Holders of the
notes who are in doubt as to their tax position should consult their professional advisers.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. In addition, any reference to a tax, duty, levy, impost or
other charge or withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only. Also,
please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate income tax (impˆot sur le
_revenu des collectivit´es), municipal business tax (impˆot commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge_
(contribution au fonds pour l’emploi) as well as personal income tax (impˆot sur le revenu) generally. Holders
of the notes may further be subject to net wealth tax (impˆot sur la fortune) as well as other duties, levies or
taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax as well as the solidarity surcharge invariably apply to
most corporate taxpayers resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are generally
subject to personal income tax and the solidarity surcharge. Under certain circumstances, where an
individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking,
municipal business tax may apply as well.

**_Withholding tax and self-applied tax_**

All payments of interest and principal by the Issuer in the context of the holding, disposal, redemption
refund or exchange of the notes can be made free and clear of any withholding or deduction for or on
account of any taxes of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, withheld, or assessed by Luxembourg or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, in accordance with applicable Luxembourg law,
subject to the application of the laws dated June 21, 2005 implementing in Luxembourg domestic law the
Council Directive 2003/48/EC of June 3, 2003 (the ‘‘EU Savings Directive’’) and several agreements
concluded with certain dependent or associated territories and providing for the possible application of a
withholding tax (35%) on interest paid to certain non-Luxembourg resident investors (individuals and
certain types of entities called ‘‘residual entities’’) in the event of the Issuer appointing a paying agent in
Luxembourg within the meaning of the above mentioned directive (see paragraph ‘‘—EU Savings
Directive’’ below) or agreements, as well as subject to the application, regarding Luxembourg resident
individuals, of the Luxembourg law of December 23, 2005, which has introduced a 10% withholding tax
(which is final when Luxembourg resident individuals are acting in the context of the management of their
private wealth) on savings income (i.e., with certain exemptions, savings income within the meaning of the
Luxembourg laws of June 21, 2005 implementing the EU Savings Directive).

In addition, pursuant to the law of December 23, 2005 as amended by the law of July 17, 2008,
Luxembourg resident individuals who are the beneficial owners of savings income paid by a paying agent
established outside Luxembourg, in a Member State of either the European Union or the European
Economic Area, or in a jurisdiction having concluded an agreement with Luxembourg in connection with

173


-----

the EU Savings Directive can opt to self declare and pay a 10% tax on this savings income. This 10% tax is
final when Luxembourg resident individuals are acting in the context of the management of their private
wealth.

Responsibility for the withholding of tax in application of the above mentioned Luxembourg laws of
June 21, 2005 and December 23, 2005 is assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent within the meaning of
these laws and not by the Issuer.

**_Taxes on Income and Capital Gains_**

Luxembourg resident holders of notes will not be liable for any Luxembourg income tax on repayment of
principal.

Interest received by an individual resident in Luxembourg is, in principle, subject to withholding tax or to
the self-applied 10% tax (see above ‘‘Withholding tax and self-applied tax’’). This withholding tax or self
applied tax represents the final tax liability for Luxembourg individual resident taxpayers receiving the
interest payment in the course of their private wealth. Individual Luxembourg resident holders of notes
receiving the interest as business income must include this interest in their taxable basis. If applicable, the
10% Luxembourg withholding tax levied will be credited against their final income tax liability.

Luxembourg resident individual holders of notes are not subject to taxation on capital gains upon the
disposal of the notes, unless the disposal of the notes precedes the acquisition of the notes or the notes are
disposed of within six months of the date of acquisition of these notes. Upon the sale, redemption or
exchange of the notes, accrued but unpaid interest will be subject to the 10% withholding tax, if applicable.
Individual Luxembourg resident holders of notes receiving the interest as business income must also
include the portion of the price corresponding to this interest in their taxable income. The 10%
Luxembourg withholding tax levied will be credited against their final income tax liability.

Luxembourg resident corporate holders of notes, or holders of notes who have a permanent establishment,
a permanent representative or a fixed base of business in Luxembourg with which the holding of the notes
is connected, must for income tax purposes include in their taxable income any interest (including accrued
but unpaid interest) as well as the difference between the sale or redemption price and the lower of the
cost or book value of the notes sold or redeemed.

Luxembourg resident corporate holders of notes which are companies benefiting from a special tax regime
(such as family wealth management companies subject to the amended law of May 11, 2007, undertakings
for collective investment subject to the amended law of December 17, 2010 or specialized investment funds
subject to the amended law of February 13, 2007) are tax exempt entities in Luxembourg, and are thus not
subject to any Luxembourg tax (i.e., corporate income tax, municipal business tax and net wealth tax) other
than the annual subscription tax calculated on their (paid up) share capital (and share premium) or net
asset value.

**_Net Wealth Tax_**

Luxembourg net wealth tax will not be levied on a holder of a note unless:

(1) such holder is, or is deemed to be, resident in Luxembourg for the purpose of the relevant provisions,
with the exception of the following entities that are net wealth tax exempt, being (i) undertakings for
collective investment within the meaning of the amended laws of December 17, 2010 or of
February 13, 2007, (ii) investment companies in risk capital (SICARs) within the meaning of the
amended law dated June 15, 2004, (iii) securitization entities within the meaning of the amended law
dated March 22, 2004 and (iv) family wealth management companies within the meaning of the
amended law of May 11, 2007; or

(2) such note is attributable to an enterprise or part thereof which is carried on through a permanent
establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg.

Regarding individuals, the Luxembourg law of December 23, 2005 abolished the net wealth tax with effect
from the year 2006.

174


-----

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

Where the notes are transferred for no consideration:

(1) No Luxembourg inheritance tax is levied on the transfer of the notes upon death of a holder of a note
in cases where the deceased holder was not a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax purposes;

(2) Luxembourg gift tax will be levied in the event that the gift is made pursuant to a notarial deed signed
before a Luxembourg notary or is registered in Luxembourg.

**_Value Added Tax_**

There is no Luxembourg value added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the issue of
the notes or in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the notes or the transfer of a note;
_provided that Luxembourg value added tax may, however, be payable in respect of fees charged for certain_
services rendered to the Issuer, if for Luxembourg value added tax purposes such services are rendered, or
are deemed to be rendered, in Luxembourg and an exemption from value added tax does not apply with
respect to such services.

**_Other Taxes and Duties_**

Under Luxembourg tax law and current administration practice, it is not compulsory that the notes be
recorded or enrolled with any court or other authority in Luxembourg or that registration tax, transfer tax,
capital tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty (other than court fees and contributions for the
registration with the Chamber of Commerce) be paid in respect of or in connection with the execution,
delivery or enforcement by legal proceedings (including any foreign judgment in the courts of
Luxembourg) of the notes in accordance therewith, except that in case of court proceedings in a
Luxembourg court (including but not limited to a Luxembourg Insolvency Proceeding), registration of the
notes may be ordered by the court (and even in the absence of such order, registration could in principle
be required in the event the notes are produced either directly or by way of reference before such
Luxembourg court, including in any act introducing legal proceedings), in which case the notes will be
subject to a fixed duty of A12 or an ad valorem duty. Registration would in principle further be ordered, and
the same registration duties could be due, when the notes are produced, either directly or by way of
reference, before an official authority (autorit´e constitu´ee) in Luxembourg.

**_Residence_**

A holder of a note will not become resident, or deemed to be resident, in Luxembourg by reason only of
the holding of such note or the execution, performance, delivery or enforcement of that or any other note.

**EU Savings Directive**

On June 3, 2003, the EU Council of Economic and Finance Ministers adopted a new directive regarding
the taxation of savings income (the ‘‘EU Savings Directive’’). The EU Savings Directive is, in principle,
applied by Member States as from July 1, 2005 and has been implemented in Luxembourg by the laws of
21 June 2005. Under the EU Savings Directive, each Member State is required to provide to the tax
authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a
paying agent within the meaning of the EU Savings Directive to an individual resident or certain types of
entities called ‘‘residual entities’’ established in that other Member State (or certain dependent and
associated territories i.e., Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Montserrat, British Virgin Islands, Aruba and
Cura¸cao, Sint Maarten, as well as Bonaire, Saba and Saint Eustatius (i.e., the former Netherlands
Antilles)). For a transitional period, however, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg are permitted to apply an
optional information reporting system whereby if a beneficial owner does not comply with one of two
procedures for information reporting, the Member State will levy a withholding tax on payments to such
beneficial owner. By Royal Decree dated September 27, 2009 and published in the Belgian Official Gazette
on October 1, 2009, the Belgian State elected to abandon the transitional withholding system and provide
information in accordance with the Directive as from January 1, 2010. The current rate of withholding is of
35% and the withholding tax system will apply for a transitional period. The transitional period is to
terminate at the end of the first full fiscal year following agreement by certain non-EU countries to the
exchange of information relating to such payments.

Also with effect from July 1, 2005, a number of non-EU countries (Switzerland, Andorra, Liechtenstein,
Monaco and San Marino) and certain dependent or associated territories (Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man,

175


-----

Montserrat, British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, Turks and Ca¨ıcos, Cayman Islands, Aruba and Cura¸cao, Sint
Maarten, as well as Bonaire, Saba and Saint Eustatius (i.e., the former Netherlands Antilles)) have agreed
to adopt similar measures (either provision of information or transitional withholding) in relation to
payments made by a paying agent (within the meaning of the EU Savings Directive) within its jurisdiction
to, or collected by such a paying agent for, an individual resident or a residual entity established in a
Member State. In addition, the Member States have entered into reciprocal provision of information or
transitional withholding arrangements with certain of those dependent or associated territories (Jersey,
Guernsey, Isle of Man, Montserrat, British Virgin Islands, Aruba, Cura¸cao, Sint Maarten, as well as
Bonaire, Saba and Saint Eustatius (i.e., the former Netherlands Antilles)) in relation to payments made by
a paying agent (within the meaning of the EU Savings Directive) in a Member State to, or collected by
such a paying agent for, an individual resident or a residual entity established in one of those territories.

On 15 September 2008 the European Commission issued a report to the Council of the European Union
on the operation of the Directive, which included the Commission’s advice on the need for changes to the
Directive. On 13 November 2008, the European Commission published a detailed proposal for
amendments to the Directive. The European Parliament approved an amended version of this proposal on
24 April 2009. If any of those proposed changes are made in relation to the Directive they may amend or
broaden the scope of the requirements described above.

**ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the notes by
employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are
subject to Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any Federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or
regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, ‘‘Similar Laws’’), and
entities whose underlying assets are considered to include ‘‘plan assets’’ of such plans, accounts and
arrangements pursuant to the U.S. Department of Labor ‘‘plan assets’’ regulation, 29 CFR
Section 2510.3-101, as amended by Section 3(42) of ERISA (each, a ‘‘Plan’’).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an ‘‘ERISA Plan’’) and prohibit certain transactions involving the
assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any
person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan
or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice
for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the
ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the
Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to the fiduciary’s duties
to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

**Prohibited Transaction Laws**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are ‘‘parties in interest’’, within the meaning
of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or ‘‘disqualified persons’’, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code,
unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and
the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited
transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

The acquisition or holding of the notes by a Plan with respect to which the Issuer or any of its affiliates are
considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is
acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction
exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class
exemptions (‘‘PTCEs’’) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions
include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified
professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE
91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general
accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. There can be no
assurance that any class exemption or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular
transaction involving the notes, or that if an exemption is available, it will cover all aspects of any particular
transaction.

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing ‘‘plan assets’’
of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under ERISA and the Code or a violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note or any interest therein, each purchaser and holder (including each
transferee) will be deemed to have represented and warranted at the time of its purchase and throughout
the period that it holds such note or interest therein, that (A) either (i) it is not, and is not acting on behalf
of (and for so long as it holds such note (or any interest therein) will not be, or be acting on behalf of), a
Plan, and is not acquiring the note directly or indirectly with the assets of a person who is or while the note

177


-----

is held will be, a Plan, or (ii) the purchase and holding of the notes will not constitute or result in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation
under any applicable Similar Laws and will not subject the Issuer to any laws, rules, or regulations
applicable to such Plan solely as a result of the investment in the Issuer by such Plan, (B) neither the Issuer
nor any of its affiliates is a ‘‘fiduciary’’ (within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(21) or any Similar Laws)
with respect to the purchaser or holder in connection with such person’s purchase or holding of the notes,
or as a result of any exercise by the Issuer or any of its affiliates of any rights in connection with the notes,
and (C) it will not sell or otherwise transfer any such note or interest to any person without first obtaining
these same foregoing deemed representations, warranties and covenants from that person.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity
of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited
transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the notes
on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability
of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption
would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes.

The sale of notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by the Issuers that such an investment meets all
relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan, or that
such an investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan.

Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. is located at 60 Wall Street, New York, NY 10005, United States, and
Deutsche Bank AG London Branch is located at 1 Great Winchester Street, London EC2N 2DB, United
Kingdom.

The Initial Purchasers may make offers and sales through certain affiliates of the Initial Purchasers. One or
more of the Initial Purchasers may sell through affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities for sales
of the notes in jurisdictions in which they are not otherwise permitted.

Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. is not a broker-dealer registered with the SEC participating in the
offering exclusively in reliance on regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933 and will not be offering or
selling notes to in the U.S. or to U.S. citizens or residents.

Itau BBA International Limited is not a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and therefore may not
make sales of any notes in the United States or to U.S. persons except in compliance with applicable U.S.
laws and regulations. To the extent that Itau BBA International Limited intends to effect sales of the notes
in the United States, it will do so only through Itau BBA USA Securities, Inc., or one or more U.S.
registered broker-dealers or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S. law.

Banco Santander, S.A. is not a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and therefore may not make sales of
any securities in the United States or to U.S. persons except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and
regulations. Any offers and sales into the United States by Banco Santander, S.A. will only be made

179


-----

through Santander Investment Securities Inc. or one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers, or otherwise
as permitted by applicable U.S. law.

In the purchase agreement, subject to the conditions thereof, the Initial Purchasers have agreed to
purchase the Euro notes and Dollar notes offered hereby at a discount from their respective prices
indicated on the cover page of these listing particulars and to resell such notes to purchasers as described
herein under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’. The offering of the notes by the Initial Purchasers is subject to receipt
and acceptance and subject to the Initial Purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. After the
offering of the notes offered hereby, the offering prices and other selling terms may from time to time be
varied by the Initial Purchasers. The purchase agreement provides that the obligation of the Initial
Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Euro notes and the Dollar notes is subject to, among other
conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by our counsel.

The purchase agreement provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors, on one hand, and the several Initial
Purchasers, on the other hand, will indemnify each other against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments the other may be required to make in respect
thereof. In order to facilitate the offering of the notes, the Initial Purchasers may engage in transactions
that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the prices of the notes. Specifically, the Initial Purchasers may
overallot in connection with this offering, creating a short position in the notes for their own accounts. In
addition, to cover overallotments or to stabilize the prices of the notes, the Initial Purchasers may bid for,
and purchase, notes in the open market. Finally, the Initial Purchasers may reclaim selling concessions
allowed to a trustee or dealer for distributing the notes in this offering if the Initial Purchasers repurchase
previously distributed notes in transactions to cover short positions, in stabilization transactions or
otherwise. Any of these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the notes above
independent market levels. The Initial Purchasers are not required to engage in these activities, and may
end any of these activities at any time. No assurance can be given that active public markets or other
markets will develop for the notes or as to the liquidity of the trading market for the notes.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed that it will not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose
of any of their debt securities or any debt securities of our subsidiaries similar to the notes during the
period beginning on May 2, 2013 and ending on the date that is 90 days following the closing date of this
offering without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

The notes and the related Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act.
The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the notes (1) outside the United States
in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S and (2) in the United States to QIBs in reliance on
Rule 144A. The terms used above have the meanings given to them by Regulation S and Rule 144A.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering of the notes, an offer or sale of such
notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering of the notes may violate
the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in
accordance with Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

The notes will be new securities for which there are currently no markets. An application will be made for
the notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be traded on the Euro
MTF. However, the Issuer cannot assure you that the initial prices at which the notes will sell in the market
after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering prices or that active trading markets for the
notes will develop and continue after completion of this offering. The Initial Purchasers have advised us
that they currently intend to make a market for the notes. However, the Initial Purchasers are not
obligated to do so, and may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the notes at any time
without notice. In addition, market-making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange
Act, and may be limited. Accordingly, the issuer cannot assure you as to the liquidity of, or trading markets
for, the notes.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that these listing particulars are directed solely at:

(i) persons who are outside the United Kingdom;

(ii) persons who have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within
Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005,
as amended (the ‘‘Order’’);

(iii) high net worth entities, and other persons to whom it may lawfully be communicated, falling
within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order; and

180


-----

(iv) persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in connection with the
issue or sale of any notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be
communicated,

(all such persons in (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above together being referred to as ‘‘relevant persons’’).

Any investment or investment activity to which these listing particulars relate will only be available to and
will only be engaged with, relevant persons. Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely
on these listing particulars.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates that have a lending relationship with us and
routinely hedge their credit exposure consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically,
such Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions
in securities, including potentially the notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading
prices of the notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations
and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments
and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and
instruments. In addition, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may acquire the notes for their own
proprietary account.

The Initial Purchasers may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular Initial Purchaser
repays to the Initial Purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the
representative has repurchased notes sold by or for the account of such purchaser in stabilizing or short
covering transactions.

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in,
investment banking, financial advisory, consulting, commercial banking, and other commercial dealings,
including as acting as hedge counterparties with us, our principal shareholders or our affiliates. In addition,
the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have lending relationships with us, our principal
shareholders or our affiliates including pursuant to bilateral loan facilities, multilateral and/or syndicated
loan facilities, guarantee, overdraft or cash management facilities and other forms of credit lines. They
have received, and expect to receive, customary fees, commissions and expense reimbursements for these
transactions. Each of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders and/or agents under the
Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, the net proceeds from this offering will be used to repay amounts
under certain of our existing debt facilities, including amounts owed to certain of the Initial Purchasers or

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The Issuer has not registered the notes under the Securities Act and, therefore, the notes may not be
offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. Accordingly, the notes are only to be offered and sold to:

- QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act; and

- in offers and sales that occur outside the United States to foreign purchasers, that is, purchasers who
are not U.S. persons.

The term ‘‘foreign purchasers’’ includes dealers or other professional fiduciaries in the United States
acting on a discretionary basis for foreign beneficial owners, other than an estate or trust, in offshore
transactions meeting the requirements of Rule 903 of Regulation S. We use the terms ‘‘offshore
transaction,’’ ‘‘U.S. person’’ and ‘‘United States’’ with the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

If you purchase notes, you will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows:

(1) You understand and acknowledge that the notes have not been registered under the Securities
Act or any other applicable securities laws and that the notes are being offered for resale in
transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws,
including sales pursuant to Rule 144A, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or
otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities
Act or any other applicable securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom, or in a
transaction not subject thereto, and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set
forth in paragraph (4) below.

(2) You are not our ‘‘affiliate’’ (as defined in Rule 144), you are not acting on our behalf and you are
either:

(a) a QIB and are aware that any sale of these notes to you will be made in reliance on
Rule 144A and such acquisition will be for your own account or for the account of another
QIB; or

(b) not a ‘‘U.S. person’’ as defined in Regulation S or purchasing for the account or benefit of a
U.S. person (other than a distributor) and you are purchasing notes in an offshore
transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

(3) You acknowledge that neither the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser nor any person representing the
Issuer or the Initial Purchasers has made any representation to you with respect to the Issuer or
the offer or sale of any of the notes, other than the information contained in these listing
particulars, which listing particulars have been delivered to you and upon which you are relying in
making your investment decision with respect to the notes. You acknowledge that the Initial
Purchasers make no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of these
listing particulars. You have had access to such financial and other information concerning us and
the notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuer
and the Initial Purchasers.

(4) You are purchasing notes for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which
you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for
offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act, subject
to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the property of such investor
account or accounts be at all times within your or their control and subject to your or their ability
to resell such notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other available exemption from
registration available under the Securities Act. You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of
any investor account for which you are purchasing the notes, and each subsequent holder of these
notes by its acceptance thereof will agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such notes prior to
(x) the date which is one year (or such shorter period of time as permitted by Rule 144(k) under
the Securities Act or any successor provision thereunder) after the later of the date of the original
issue of these notes and the last date on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates were the owner of
such notes (or any predecessor thereto) or (y) such later date, if any, as may be required by
applicable law (the ‘‘Resale Restriction Termination Date’’) only:

(a) to us;

182


-----

(b) pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared effective under the
Securities Act;

(c) for so long as the notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person you
reasonably believe is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of another
QIB to whom you give notice that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A;

(d) pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons occurring outside the United States within
the meaning of Regulation S; or

(e) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act,

subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of the seller’s property
or the property of an investor account or accounts be within the seller or account’s control, and in
compliance with any applicable state securities laws.

The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date.
You acknowledge that the Issuer, the trustee and the registrar reserve the right prior to any offer, sale or
other transfer of the notes pursuant to clause (d) above prior to the end of the 40-day distribution
compliance period within the meaning of Regulation S or pursuant to clause (e) above prior to the Resale
Restriction Termination Date of the notes to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certifications
and other information satisfactory to us, the trustee and the registrar.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each note will contain a legend substantially in the following form:

‘‘THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE ‘‘U.S. SECURITIES ACT’’), OR OTHER SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE
OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS NOTE NOR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION

PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, TO A PERSON IT
REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A ‘‘QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER’’ AS DEFINED IN RULE
144A UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT THAT PURCHASES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR
FOR THE ACCOUNT OF ANOTHER QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER TO WHOM
NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A

SECURITIES ACT, AND (3) AGREES THAT IT WILL GIVE TO EACH PERSON TO WHOM THIS
NOTE IS TRANSFERRED A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND;

SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER, THE TRUSTEE AND THE REGISTRAR IS COMPLETED AND
DELIVERED BY THE TRANSFEROR. THIS LEGEND WILL BE REMOVED UPON THE
REQUEST OF THE HOLDER AFTER THE RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION DATE. AS
USED HEREIN, THE TERMS ‘‘OFFSHORE TRANSACTION,’’ ‘‘UNITED STATES’’ AND ‘‘U.S.
PERSON’’ HAVE THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM BY REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S.
SECURITIES ACT’’.

If you purchase notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to
holders of beneficial interests in these notes as well as to holders of these notes.

(1) You acknowledge that the registrar will not be required to accept for registration of transfer any
notes acquired by you, except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the registrar
that the restrictions set forth herein have been complied with.

(2) You acknowledge that:

(a) the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of your
acknowledgements, representations and agreements set forth herein and you agree that, if
any of your acknowledgements, representations or agreements herein cease to be accurate

(b) if you are acquiring any notes as fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, you
represent with respect to each such account that:

(i) you have sole investment discretion; and

(as defined below), you shall not make any offer or sale of these notes to a U.S. person or for the
account or benefit of a U.S. person within the meaning of Rule 902 under the Securities Act. The
‘‘distribution compliance period’’ means the 40-day period following the issue date for the notes.

(5) You understand that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by
the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of these listing particulars or any other material relating to
the Issuer or the notes in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required.
Consequently, any transfer of the notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under
‘‘Plan of Distribution’’.

Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of notes will also be deemed to have made the representations
and warranties set forth in ‘‘ERISA Considerations’’, above.

particulars and, to the extent provided to the Initial Purchasers by us for such purpose, any related
amendments or supplements to these listing particulars. Each person receiving these listing particulars and

all additional information considered by it to be necessary to verify the accuracy and
completeness of the information herein;

(b) such person has not relied on the Initial Purchasers or any person affiliated with the Initial

Rule 144A(a)(3) under the Securities Act, we will, during any period in which we are neither subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as amended, nor exempt from the
reporting requirements under Rule 12g3-2(b) of the Exchange Act, as amended, make available to the
holder or beneficial owner of such restricted securities or to any prospective purchaser of such restricted
securities designated by such holder or beneficial owner, in each case upon the written request of such
holder, beneficial owner or prospective purchaser, the information required to be provided by
Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. Any such request should be directed to the Issuer.

185


-----

**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and none of its directors are residents of the
United States. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the Issuer’s assets and a substantial portion of the
assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for
investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or such persons, or to
enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. Federal
or state securities laws.

We have been advised that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound by a treaty
providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in
civil and commercial matters in the territory of the United States and in commercial matters in the
territory of Luxembourg. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies
rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon
the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received
such favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur)
by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant
to articles 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg _Nouveau Code de Proc´edure Civile. The District Court will_
authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following
conditions are met:

- the U.S. judgment is enforceable (executoire) in the United States;

- the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter under
applicable U.S. Federal or state jurisdiction rules, and that jurisdiction is recognized by Luxembourg
private international and local law;

- the U.S. court has applied to the dispute the substantive law which would have been applied by the
Luxembourg conflict of laws rules;

- the U.S. Court order or judgment must not have been rendered subsequent to an evasion of
Luxembourg law (‘‘fraude `a la loi’’);

- the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the
laws of Luxembourg or has been given in proceedings of a criminal nature;

- the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws; and

- the judgment was granted following proceedings where the principles of natural justice have been
complied with, and where the counterparty was granted the necessary time to prepare its case, had the
opportunity to appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense.

In practice, Luxembourg courts now tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although there is
no clear statutory prohibition of such review.

If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law
if its application contravenes Luxembourg’s international public policy. In an action brought in
Luxembourg on the basis, for instance, of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not
have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought.

Further, the following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in Spain
is based upon advice provided to us by our Spanish legal advisers. A final and conclusive judgment duly
rendered by certain U.S. courts or any other appellate court in the United States would be enforceable in
the competent courts of Spain, provided that prior to the time such U.S. court judgment is introduced into
a Spanish court for enforcement, there is no material contradiction or incompatibility with a judgment
rendered or judicial proceedings outstanding in Spain, in accordance with Article 523.2 and the
Derogation Provision of the current Civil Procedural Law and subject to the former Civil Procedural Law
of 1881, the substantive provisions of which are found in Articles 951 to 958, both inclusive. Such
provisions and the case law set forth that any final judgment rendered outside Spain may be enforced in
Spain in three different situations: (i) in the cases and in accordance with the provisions of any applicable
treaty; (ii) in the absence of any such treaty, in case it is alleged and evidenced that the jurisdiction where
the foreign judgment was given recognizes Spanish judgments on a reciprocal basis when the requirements
established in such foreign jurisdiction for the recognition of Spanish judgments are complied with and
provided that some minimal conditions are met (inter alia, that the matter is not subject to Spanish
exclusive jurisdiction for certain matters, does not infringe public policy and is not in contradiction with a

186


-----

previous Spanish judgment); and (iii) in the absence of an applicable treaty and when the positive
reciprocity has not been evidenced, in those cases in which the judgment given in the foreign jurisdiction
complies with the requirements set forth in article 954 of the Civil Procedural Law of 1881 which are that
(a) the judgment has been rendered as a result of an action ‘‘in personam’’ (as opposed to an action ‘‘in
rem’’); (b) the defendant has been properly served with the originating process; (c) the obligation to be
enforced is legal under Spanish law; (d) the documentation prepared for the purpose of requesting the
enforcement meets all requirements under the law of the United States in order to be considered an
authentic judgment and it also meets all requirements under the laws of Spain; and (e) it is not evidenced
that a Spanish judgment would not be recognized by and would not be enforceable in the relevant
jurisdiction of the United States on a reciprocal basis. Since there is no applicable treaty between Spain
and the United States, unless the conditions under (ii) above are met and, in accordance with certain court
precedents, even if these conditions are met, the conditions referred to in (iii) above will have to be
satisfied in order to enforce a judgment of a U.S. court in Spain.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed that any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or based upon
the Indenture, the notes or the Guarantees may be instituted in any Federal or state court located in New
York City, and the Issuer and the Guarantors have appointed CT Corporation System as their agent for
service of process in any such suit, action or proceeding.

 7.2 Claims under a Letter of Credit

 (a) Each Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally authorises the Issuing Bank to pay any claim made or purported to be made under a Letter of Credit requested by it (or requested by the Company on its behalf) and which appears on its face to be in order (in this Clause 7, a "claim").

 (e) If a Borrower has provided cash cover in respect of a Lender's participation in a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall seek reimbursement from that cash cover before making a demand of that Lender under paragraph (b) above. Any recovery made by an Issuing Bank pursuant to that cash cover will reduce that Lender's liability under paragraph (b) above.

 (f) The obligations of any Lender or Borrower under this Clause will not be affected by any act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause, would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Clause (without limitation and whether or not known to it or any other person) including:

 (i) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor, any beneficiary under a Letter of Credit or any other person;

 (i) on the date of this Agreement or on any later date on which it becomes such a Lender in accordance with Clause 2.3 (Increase) or Clause 29 (Changes to the Lenders) whether it is a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender; and

 (ii) as soon as practicable upon becoming aware of the same, that it has become a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender,

 and an indication in Schedule 1 (The Original Parties), in a Transfer Certificate, in an Assignment Agreement or in an Increase Confirmation to that effect will constitute a notice under paragraph (i) above to the Agent and, upon delivery in accordance with Clause 29.7 (Copy of Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement or Increase Confirmation to Company), to the Company.


-----

### (e) Any notice received by the Agent pursuant to paragraph (d) above shall constitute notice to the Issuing Bank of that Lender's status and the Agent shall, upon receiving each such notice, promptly notify the Issuing Bank of that Lender's status as specified in that notice.

 (i) to the extent that such cash collateral has not been applied in satisfaction of any amount due and payable under this Agreement by that Lender to the Issuing Bank in respect of the relevant Letter of Credit;

 (B) the relevant Lender's obligations in respect of the relevant Letter of Credit are transferred to a New Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; or

-----

### (iii) if no amount is due and payable by the relevant Lender in respect of the relevant Letter of Credit,

 (c) To the extent that a Borrower has provided cash cover pursuant to Clause 7.4 (Cash collateral by Non-Acceptable L/C Lender and Borrower's option to provide cash cover) or Clause 7.5 (Requirement for cash cover from Borrower), the relevant Lender's L/C Proportion in respect of that Letter of Credit will remain (but that Lender's obligations in relation to that Letter of Credit may be satisfied in accordance with paragraph (d)(ii) of Clause 1.2 (Construction)). However, the relevant Borrower's obligation to pay any Letter of Credit fee in relation to the relevant Letter of Credit to the Agent (for the account of that Lender) in accordance with paragraph (b) of Clause 17.5 (Fees payable in respect of Letters of Credit) will be reduced proportionately as from the date on which it provides that cash cover (and for so long as the relevant amount of cash cover continues to stand as collateral).

### SECTION 5
 COSTS OF UTILISATION

 14. INTEREST

 14.1 Calculation of interest

 The rate of interest on each Loan for each Interest Period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable:

 (a) Margin; and

 (b) LIBOR or, in relation to any Loan in euro, EURIBOR.

 14.2 Payment of interest

 (a) The Borrower to which a Loan has been made shall pay accrued interest on that Loan on the last day of each Interest Period (and, if the Interest Period is longer than six Months, on the dates falling at six Monthly intervals after the first day of the Interest Period).

 (b) If the Compliance Certificate received by the Agent which relates to the relevant Annual Financial Statements shows:

 (i) that a higher Margin should have applied during a certain period, then the Company shall (or shall ensure the relevant Borrower shall) promptly pay to the Agent any amounts necessary to put the Agent and the Lenders in the position they would have been in had the appropriate rate of the Margin applied during such period; or

 (ii) that a lower Margin should have applied during a certain period, then the amount of interest due on the next interest payment date shall be reduced by the amount necessary to put the Borrowers in the position they would have been in had the appropriate rate of Margin applied during such period, 

 provided that any such reduction or increase shall only apply to the extent that any Lender which received the underpayment or overpayment of interest remains a Lender at the date of such adjustment.

 14.3 Default interest

 (a) If an Obligor fails to pay any amount payable by it under a Finance Document on its due date, interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from the due date up to the date of actual payment (both before and after judgment) at a rate which, subject to paragraph (b) below, is one per cent. per annum higher than the rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment, constituted a Loan in the currency of the overdue amount for successive Interest Periods, each of a duration selected by the Agent (acting reasonably). Any interest accruing under this Clause 14.3 shall be immediately payable by the Obligor on demand by the Agent.


-----

### (b) If any overdue amount consists of all or part of a Loan which became due on a day which was not the last day of an Interest Period relating to that Loan:

 (i) the first Interest Period for that overdue amount shall have a duration equal to the unexpired portion of the current Interest Period relating to that Loan; and

 (ii) the rate of interest applying to the overdue amount during that first Interest Period shall be one per cent. per annum higher than the rate which would have applied if the overdue amount had not become due.

 (c) Default interest (if unpaid) arising on an overdue amount will be compounded with the overdue amount at the end of each Interest Period applicable to that overdue amount but will remain immediately due and payable.

 14.4 Notification of rates of interest

In addition the Company may select an Interest Period in relation to Facility A of a period of less than one Month, if necessary to ensure that there are Facility A Loans (with an aggregate Base Currency Amount equal to or greater than the Repayment Instalment) which have an Interest Period ending on a Repayment Date relating to Facility A for the Company to make the Repayment Instalment due on that date.

 (e) An Interest Period for a Loan shall not extend beyond the Termination Date applicable to its Facility.

 (f) Each Interest Period for a Term Loan shall start on the Utilisation Date or (if already made) on the last day of its preceding Interest Period.


-----

### (g) A Revolving Facility Loan has one Interest Period only.

 15.2 Changes to Interest Periods

If the Agent makes any such change, it shall promptly notify the Company and the Lenders.

 15.3 Non-Business Days

 If an Interest Period would otherwise end on a day which is not a Business Day, that Interest Period will instead end on the next Business Day in that calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).

 (c) If a Market Disruption Event occurs the Agent shall, as soon as is practicable, notify the Company.

 (d) In this Agreement:

 "Market Disruption Event" means:

 (i) at or about noon on the Quotation Day for the relevant Interest Period the Screen Rate is not available and none or only one of the Base Reference Banks supplies a rate to the Agent to determine LIBOR or, if applicable, EURIBOR for the relevant currency and Interest Period; or

 (ii) before close of business in London on the Quotation Day for the relevant Interest Period, the Agent receives notifications from a Lender or Lenders (whose participations in a Loan exceed 50 per cent. of that Loan) that the cost to it of funding its participation in that Loan from whatever source it may reasonably select would be in excess of LIBOR or, if applicable, EURIBOR.

 16.3 Alternative basis of interest or funding

 (A) is compensated for by an increased payment under Clause 18.2 (Tax gross-up);

 If a New Lender, an Increase Lender or an Additional Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this Clause 18.5 then such New Lender, Increase Lender or Additional Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement (including by each Obligor) as if it is not a Qualifying Lender or a Luxembourg Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies the Agent which categories apply (and the Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform the Company).

 (a) All amounts expressed to be payable under a Finance Document by any Party to a Finance Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply for VAT purposes are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on that supply, and accordingly, subject to paragraph (b) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party to any Party under a Finance Document and such Finance Party is required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, that Party must pay to such Finance Party (in addition to and at the same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of the VAT (and such Finance Party must promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to that Party).

 (b) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party (the "Supplier") to any other Finance Party (the "Recipient") under a Finance Document, and any Party other than the Recipient (the "Relevant Party") is required by the terms of any Finance Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for that supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration);

 (c) Where a Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a Finance Party for any cost or expense, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Finance Party for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such Finance Party reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.

 (d) Any reference in this Clause 18.7 to any Party shall, at any time when such Party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of such group at such time (the term "representative member" shall (i) have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 37/1992, of December 28 with regard to Spain or (ii) where applicable, with regard to another jurisdiction refer to an equivalent provision under the relevant laws of such jurisdiction to that referred to in (i)).

 (e) In relation to any supply made by a Finance Party to any Party under a Finance Document, if reasonably requested by such Finance Party, that Party must promptly provide such Finance Party with details of that Party's VAT registration and such other information as is reasonably requested in connection with such Finance Party's VAT reporting requirements in relation to such supply.

 (i) any law or regulation;

 (ii) any fiduciary duty; or

 (iii) any duty of confidentiality. 

 (d) If a Party fails to confirm its status or to supply forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with paragraph (a) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where paragraph (c) above applies), then:

 (i) if that Party failed to confirm whether it is (and/or remains) a FATCA Exempt Party then such Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Finance Documents as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party; and

 (ii) if that Party failed to confirm its applicable "passthru payment percentage" then such Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Finance Documents (and payments made thereunder) as if its applicable "passthru payment percentage" is 100%,

 until (in each case) such time as the Party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information.

 18.9 FATCA Deduction

 (a) Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall be required to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment for that FATCA Deduction.

 (a) guarantees to each Finance Party punctual performance by each other Obligor of all that Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents;

 (b) undertakes with each Finance Party that whenever another Obligor does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document, that Guarantor shall immediately on demand pay that amount as if it was the principal obligor; and

 (c) agrees with each Finance Party that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation, indemnify that Finance Party immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability it incurs as a result of an Obligor not paying any amount which would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under any Finance Document on the date when it would have been due. The amount payable by a Guarantor under this indemnity will not exceed the amount it would have had to pay under this Clause 23 if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a guarantee,

 subject in each case to any limitations referred to in Clause 23.11 (Guarantee Limitations) or in any Accession Agreement by which such guarantor become party to this Agreement.

 23.2 Continuing Guarantee

 This guarantee and indemnity is independent and separate from the obligations of any Obligor (and, consequently, the guarantee granted by any Spanish Guarantor under this Agreement will in no event be construed or configured as a Spanish "fianza" for the purposes of article 1,822 seq of the Spanish Civil Code) and is a continuing guarantee which will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by any Obligor under the Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.

 23.3 Reinstatement

 If any discharge, release or arrangement (whether in respect of the obligations of any Obligor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by a Finance Party in whole or in part on the basis of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored in insolvency, liquidation, administration or otherwise, without limitation, then the liability of each Guarantor under this Clause 23 will continue or be reinstated as if the discharge, release or arrangement had not occurred.


-----

### 23.4 Waiver of defences

 The obligations of each Guarantor under this Clause 23 will not be affected by an act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause 23, would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Clause 23 (without limitation and whether or not known to it or any Finance Party) including:

 (a) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or other person;

 (b) the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any composition or arrangement with any creditor of any member of the Group;

 (c) the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Obligor or other person or any non-presentation or non- observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security;

 (d) any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the members or status of an Obligor or any other person;

 (e) any amendment, novation, supplement, extension, restatement (however fundamental and whether or not more onerous) or replacement of a Finance Document or any other document or security including, without limitation, any change in the purpose of, any extension of or increase in any facility or the addition of any new facility under any Finance Document or other document or security;

 (f) any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any Finance Document or any other document or security; or

 (g) any insolvency or similar proceedings.

 23.5 Guarantor Intent

 Without prejudice to the generality of Clause 23.4 (Waiver of defences), each Guarantor expressly confirms that it intends that this guarantee shall extend from time to time to any (however fundamental and of whatsoever nature and whether or not more onerous) variation, increase, extension or addition of or to any of the Finance Documents and/or any facility or amount made available under any of the Finance Documents for the purposes of or in connection with any of the following: business acquisitions of any nature; increasing working capital; enabling investor distributions to be made; carrying out restructurings; refinancing existing facilities; refinancing any other indebtedness; making facilities available to new borrowers; any other variation or extension of the purposes for which any such facility or amount might be made available from time to time; and any fees, costs and/or expenses associated with any of the foregoing.


-----

### 23.6 Immediate recourse

 Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any person before claiming from that Guarantor under this Clause 23. This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary.

 23.7 Appropriations

 Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, each Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) may:

 (a) refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by that Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and

 (b) hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Guarantor or on account of any Guarantor's liability under this Clause 23.

 23.8 Deferral of Guarantors' rights

 Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Agent otherwise directs, no Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of performance by it of its obligations under the Finance Documents or by reason of any amount being payable, or liability arising, under this Clause 23:

 (a) to be indemnified by an Obligor;

 (b) to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents;

 (c) to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents or of any other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the Finance Documents by any Finance Party;

 (d) to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor to make any payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any Guarantor has given a guarantee, undertaking or indemnity under Clause 23.1 (Guarantee and indemnity);

 (e) to exercise any right of set-off against any Obligor; and/or

 (f) to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with any Finance Party.


-----

### If a Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it shall hold that benefit, payment or distribution to the extent necessary to enable all amounts which may be or become payable to the Finance Parties by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents to be repaid in full on trust for the Finance Parties and shall promptly pay or transfer the same to the Agent or as the Agent may direct for application in accordance with Clause 35 (Payment mechanics).

 23.9 Release of Guarantors' right of contribution

 If any Guarantor (a "Retiring Guarantor") ceases to be a Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents for the purpose of any sale or other disposal of that Retiring Guarantor then on the date such Retiring Guarantor ceases to be a Guarantor:

 (a) that Retiring Guarantor is released by each other Guarantor from any liability (whether past, present or future and whether actual or contingent) to make a contribution to any other Guarantor arising by reason of the performance by any other Guarantor of its obligations under the Finance Documents; and

 (b) each other Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance of its obligations under the Finance Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under any Finance Document or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, any Finance Document where such rights or security are granted by or in relation to the assets of the Retiring Guarantor.

 23.10 Additional security

 This guarantee is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by any other guarantee or security now or subsequently held by any Finance Party.

 23.11 Guarantee Limitations

 (a) Spain

 The obligations of any Spanish Guarantor under this Clause 23 (Guarantee and Indemnity) or under any Transaction Security Document governed by Spanish law shall not include and shall not extend to any obligations or amounts that would render such obligations in contravention of Section 150 of the Spanish Capital Companies Act (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de Capital).

 (E) any Equity Contribution so provided shall not count towards any other threshold permission or usage under or in respect of the Finance Documents;

 (F) in relation to any Equity Contribution so provided prior to the date of delivery of the relevant Compliance Certificate for the Relevant Period, the Compliance Certificate for that Relevant Period shall set out the revised financial covenants for the Relevant Period by giving effect to the adjustments set out

 (c) If a financial covenant set out in Clause 26 (Financial Covenants) has been breached, but is complied with when tested for the next Relevant Period (the “Second Period”), then the prior breach of such financial covenant or any Event of Default arising therefrom shall no longer be outstanding or continuing for the purposes of the Finance Documents unless the Agent or the Security Agent has taken any action referred to in Clause 28.18 (Acceleration and/or Other Remedies) before delivery of the Compliance Certificate in respect of the Second Period.

 29.1 Assignments and transfers by the Lenders

 Subject to this Clause 29 and to Clause 30 (Debt Purchase Transactions), a Lender (the "Existing Lender") may:

 (a) assign any of its rights; or

 (b) transfer by novation any of its rights and obligations,

 under any Finance Document to another bank or financial institution or to a trust, fund or other entity which is regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of making, purchasing or investing in loans, securities or other financial assets or other entity approved by the Company (the "New Lender").

 29.2 Conditions of assignment or transfer

 (a) An Existing Lender must consult with the Company for not less than five Business Days before it may make an assignment or transfer in accordance with Clause 29.1 (Assignments and transfers by the Lenders) unless the assignment or transfer is:

 (i) to another Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender;

 (ii) if the Existing Lender is a fund, to a fund which is a Related Fund of the Existing Lender; or

 (iii) made at a time when an Event of Default is continuing.

 (b) No assignment or transfer may be made to a Defaulting Lender without the prior consent of the Company. The consent of the Issuing Bank is required for any assignment or transfer by an Existing Lender of any of its rights and/or obligations under the Revolving Facility.

 (c) The consent of the Company is required for any assignment or transfer by an Existing Lender of any of its rights and/or obligations under the Revolving Facility unless the assignment or transfer is:

 (i) to a New Lender (other than an Affiliate of a Lender) which has a rating for its long-term unsecured and non credit-enhanced debt obligations of BB or higher by Standard & Poor's Rating Services or Fitch Ratings Ltd or Ba2 or higher by Moody's Investors Service Limited or a comparable rating from an internationally recognised credit rating agency; or

 (ii) made at a time when an Event of Default is continuing.


-----

### (d) An assignment or transfer of part of a Lender's participation must be:

 (i) in the case of Facility A or the Revolving Facility a minimum amount of EUR 2,500,000 or in the case of Facility B a minimum amount of EUR 1,000,000 (or if less, its remaining Commitments); and 

 (ii) in an amount such that the Base Currency Amount of that Lender's remaining participation (when aggregated with its Affiliates' and Related Funds' participation) in respect of Commitments or Utilisations made under (A) Facility A and the Revolving Facility is in a minimum amount of EUR 5,000,000 and (B) Facility B is in a minimum amount of EUR 2,000,000.

 (e) The consent of the Company to an assignment or transfer must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company will be deemed to have given its consent ten Business Days after the Existing Lender has requested it unless consent is expressly refused by the Company within that time.

 (f) (Other than in the case of an assignment permitted by paragraph (b) of Clause 30.1 (Permitted Debt Purchase Transactions)) an assignment will only be effective on:

 (i) receipt by the Agent (whether in the Assignment Agreement or otherwise) of written confirmation from the New Lender (in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent) that the New Lender will assume the same obligations to the other Finance Parties and the other Secured Parties as it would have been under if it was an Original Lender;

 (ii) the New Lender entering into the documentation required for it to accede as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement; and

 (iii) the performance by the Agent of all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to such assignment to a New Lender, the completion of which the Agent shall promptly notify to the Existing Lender and the New Lender.

 (g) A transfer will only be effective if the New Lender enters into the documentation required for it to accede as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement and if the procedure set out in Clause 29.5 (Procedure for transfer) is complied with.

 (h) The Group shall not be required to bear any costs or fees or taxes incurred in relation to any transfer or assignment by a lender under any Finance Documents, including any costs or fees or taxes required to be incurred to ensure that a New Lender benefits from the Transaction Security. This paragraph (f) shall not apply in respect of an assumption, assignment or transfer made prior to the Closing Date in the ordinary course of primary syndication.


-----

### (i) If:

 (i) a Lender assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations under the Finance Documents or changes its Facility Office; and

 (ii) as a result of circumstances existing at the date the assignment, transfer or change occurs, an Obligor would be obliged to make a payment to the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office under Clause 19 (Increased Costs),

 then the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office is only entitled to receive payment under that Clause to the same extent as the Existing Lender or Lender acting through its previous Facility Office would have been if the assignment, transfer or change had not occurred.

 (ii) will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Obligor and its related entities whilst any amount is or may be outstanding under the Finance Documents or any Commitment is in force.

 (iii) the Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent, the New Lender, the other Lenders, the Issuing Bank and any relevant Ancillary Lender shall acquire the same rights and assume the same obligations between themselves and in respect of the Transaction Security as they would have acquired and assumed had the New Lender been an Original Lender with the rights, and/or obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of the transfer and to that extent the Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent, the Issuing Bank and any relevant Ancillary Lender and the Existing Lender shall each be released from further obligations to each other under the Finance Documents; and

 (d) Lenders may utilise procedures other than those set out in this Clause 29.6 to assign their rights under the Finance Documents (but not, without the consent of the relevant Obligor or unless in accordance with Clause 29.5 (Procedure for transfer), to obtain a release by that Obligor from the obligations owed to that Obligor by the Lenders nor the assumption of equivalent obligations by a New Lender) provided that they comply with the conditions set out in Clause 29.2 (Conditions of assignment or transfer).

 29.7 Copy of Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement, Increase Confirmation or Additional Lender Accession Letter to Company

 The Agent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after it has executed a Transfer Certificate, an Assignment Agreement, an Increase Confirmation or an Additional Lender Accession Letter, send to the Company a copy of that Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement, Increase Confirmation, or Additional Lender Accession Letter.

### 29.9 Pro rata interest settlement

 (a) If the Agent has notified the Lenders that it is able to distribute interest payments on a "pro rata basis" to Existing Lenders and New Lenders then (in respect of any transfer pursuant to Clause 29.5 (Procedure for transfer) or any assignment pursuant to Clause 29.6 (Procedure for assignment) the Transfer Date of which, in each case, is after the date of such notification and is not on the last day of an Interest Period):

 (i) any interest or fees in respect of the relevant participation which are expressed to accrue by reference to the lapse of time shall continue to accrue in favour of the Existing Lender up to but excluding the Transfer Date ("Accrued Amounts") and shall become due and payable to the Existing Lender (without further interest accruing on them) on the last day of the current Interest Period (or, if the Interest Period is longer than six Months, on the next of the dates which falls at six Monthly intervals after the first day of that Interest Period); and

 (ii) the rights assigned or transferred by the Existing Lender will not include the right to the Accrued Amounts so that, for the avoidance of doubt:

 (A) when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts will be payable for the account of the Existing Lender; and

 (B) the amount payable to the New Lender on that date will be the amount which would, but for the application of this Clause 29.9, have been payable to it on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.

 (b) In this Clause 29.9 references to "Interest Period" shall be construed to include a reference to any other period for accrual of fees.

 29.11 Additional Lenders

 A bank or financial institution which is to be an Additional Lender shall only become a party to this Agreement as a Lender if it has executed and delivered to the Agent an Additional Lender Accession Letter and the Agent has counter-signed the same (which the Agent agrees to do promptly upon its receipt of the relevant Additional Lender Accession Letter) and is a party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Senior Facility Lender.

 32.11 Lenders' indemnity to the Agent

 (a) Each Lender shall (in proportion to its share of the Total Commitments or, if the Total Commitments are then zero, to its share of the Total Commitments immediately prior to their reduction to zero) indemnify the Agent, within three Business Days of demand, against any cost, loss or liability (including, without limitation, for negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever) incurred by the Agent (otherwise than by reason of the Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct or deliberate breach of the terms of this Agreement) (or, in the case of any cost, loss or liability pursuant to Clause 35.11 (Disruption to Payment Systems etc.) notwithstanding the Agent's negligence, gross negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever but not including any claim based on the fraud of the Agent) in acting as Agent under the Finance Documents (unless the Agent has been reimbursed by an Obligor pursuant to a Finance Document).

 (e) The retiring Agent shall at its own cost make available to the successor Agent such documents and records and provide such assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as Agent under the Finance Documents.

 (ii) the information supplied by the Agent pursuant to Clause 18.8 (FATCA Information) indicates that the Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date; or


-----

### (iii) the Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date,

 and (in each case) the Company or a Lender reasonably believes that a Party will be required to make a FATCA Deduction that would not be required if the Agent were a FATCA Exempt Party, and the Company or that Lender, by notice to the Agent, requires it to resign.

 32.13 Replacement of the Agent

 (a) After consultation with the Company, the Majority Lenders may, by giving 30 days' notice to the Agent (or, at any time the Agent is an Impaired Agent, by giving any shorter notice determined by the Majority Lenders) replace the Agent by appointing a successor Agent (acting through an office in the United Kingdom).

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of any Finance Document to the contrary, neither the Agent nor the Arranger is obliged to disclose to any other person (i) any confidential information or (ii) any other information if the disclosure would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of any law or regulation or a breach of a fiduciary duty.

 (ii) the Agent shall determine whether the receipt or recovery is in excess of the amount the Recovering Finance Party would have been paid had the receipt or recovery been received or made by the Agent and distributed in accordance with Clause 35 (Payment mechanics), without taking account of any Tax which would be imposed on the Agent in relation to the receipt, recovery or distribution; and

 (iii) the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days of demand by the Agent, pay to the Agent an amount (the "Sharing Payment") equal to such receipt or recovery less any amount which the Agent determines may be retained by the Recovering Finance Party as its share of any payment to be made, in accordance with Clause 35.6 (Partial payments).

 ADMINISTRATION

 35. PAYMENT MECHANICS

 35.1 Payments to the Agent

 (a) On each date on which an Obligor or a Lender is required to make a payment under a Finance Document, excluding a payment under the terms of an Ancillary Document, that Obligor or Lender shall make the same available to the Agent (unless a contrary indication appears in a Finance Document) for value on the due date at the time and in such funds specified by the Agent as being customary at the time for settlement of transactions in the relevant currency in the place of payment.

 (b) Payment shall be made to such account in the principal financial centre of the country of that currency (or, in relation to euro, London, as specified by the Agent) and with such bank as the Agent, in each case, specifies.

 35.2 Distributions by the Agent

 Each payment received by the Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party shall, subject to Clause 35.3 (Distributions to an Obligor) and Clause 35.4 (Clawback and pre-funding) be made available by the Agent as soon as practicable after receipt to the Party entitled to receive payment in accordance with this Agreement (in the case of a Lender, for the account of its Facility Office), to such account as that Party may notify to the Agent by not less than five Business Days' notice with a bank specified by that Party in the principal financial centre of the country of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in the principal financial centre of a Participating Member State or London, as specified by that Party).

 35.3 Distributions to an Obligor

 The Agent may (with the consent of the Obligor or in accordance with Clause 36 (Set- Off)) apply any amount received by it for that Obligor in or towards payment (on the date and in the currency and funds of receipt) of any amount due from that Obligor under the Finance Documents or in or towards purchase of any amount of any currency to be so applied.

 35.4 Clawback and pre-funding

 (a) Where a sum is to be paid to the Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party, the Agent is not obliged to pay that sum to that other Party (or to enter into or perform any related exchange contract) until it has been able to establish to its satisfaction that it has actually received that sum.

 (b) Unless paragraph (c) below applies, if the Agent pays an amount to another Party and it proves to be the case that the Agent had not actually received that amount, then the Party to whom that amount (or the proceeds of any related exchange contract) was paid by the Agent shall on demand refund the same to the Agent together with interest on that amount from the date of payment to


-----

### the date of receipt by the Agent, calculated by the Agent to reflect its cost of funds.

 (c) If the Agent is willing to make available amounts for the account of a Borrower before receiving funds from the Lenders then if and to the extent that the Agent does so but it proves to be the case that it does not then receive funds from a Lender in respect of a sum which it paid to a Borrower:

 (i) the Agent shall notify the Company of that Lender's identity and the Borrower to whom that sum was made available shall on demand refund it to the Agent; and

 (ii) the Lender by whom those funds should have been made available or, if that Lender fails to do so, the Borrower to whom that sum was made available, shall on demand pay to the Agent the amount (as certified by the Agent) which will indemnify the Agent against any funding cost incurred by it as a result of paying out that sum before receiving those funds from that Lender.

 35.5 Impaired Agent

 (a) If, at any time, the Agent becomes an Impaired Agent, an Obligor or a Lender which is required to make a payment under the Finance Documents to the Agent in accordance with Clause 35.1 (Payments to the Agent) may instead either:

 (i) pay that amount direct to the required recipient(s); or

 (ii) if in its absolute discretion it considers that it is not reasonably practicable to pay that amount direct to the required recipient(s), pay that amount or the relevant part of that amount to an interest-bearing account held with an Acceptable Bank within the meaning of paragraph (a) of the definition of "Acceptable Bank" and in relation to which no Insolvency Event has occurred and is continuing, in the name of the Obligor or the Lender making the payment (the "Paying Party") and designated as a trust account for the benefit of the Party or Parties beneficially entitled to that payment under the Finance Documents (the "Recipient Party" or "Recipient Parties").

 In each case such payments must be made on the due date for payment under the Finance Documents.

 (b) All interest accrued on the amount standing to the credit of the trust account shall be for the benefit of the Recipient Party or the Recipient Parties pro rata to their respective entitlements.

 (c) A Party which has made a payment in accordance with this Clause 35.5 shall be discharged of the relevant payment obligation under the Finance Documents and shall not take any credit risk with respect to the amounts standing to the credit of the trust account.

### (d) Promptly upon the appointment of a successor Agent in accordance with Clause 32.13 (Replacement of the Agent), each Paying Party shall (other than to the extent that that Party has given an instruction pursuant to paragraph (e) below) give all requisite instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held to transfer the amount (together with any accrued interest) to the successor Agent for distribution to the relevant Recipient Party or Recipient Parties in accordance with Clause 35.2 (Distributions by the Agent).

 (e) A Paying Party shall, promptly upon request by a Recipient Party and to the extent:

 (i) that it has not given an instruction pursuant to paragraph (d) above; and

 (ii) that it has been provided with the necessary information by that Recipient Party,

 give all requisite instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held to transfer the relevant amount (together with any accrued interest) to that Recipient Party.

 35.6 Partial payments

 (a) If the Agent receives a payment for application against amounts due in respect of any Finance Documents that is insufficient to discharge all the amounts then due and payable by an Obligor under those Finance Documents, the Agent shall apply that payment towards the obligations of that Obligor under those Finance Documents in the following order:

 (i) first, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid amount owing to the Agent and the Arranger, the Issuing Bank or the Security Agent under those Finance Documents;

 (ii) secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of any accrued interest, fee or commission due but unpaid under those Finance Documents;

 (iii) thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any principal due but unpaid under those Finance Documents and any amount due but unpaid under Clause 7.2 (Claims under a Letter of Credit) and Clause 7.3 (Indemnities); and

 (iv) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other sum due but unpaid under the Finance Documents.

**SCHEDULE 12**
**AGREED SECURITY PRINCIPLES**

1. **General Principles**

(a) The Transaction Security will be granted in favour of the Security Agent unless required under
applicable law to be granted in favour of the Secured Parties individually.

(b) No action will be required to be taken in relation to any Transaction Security where any Secured
Party transfers or assigns any of its participation in the Facilities. The Group will not be liable for
any fees, costs, taxes or expenses in relation to any re-registration, re-notarisation or other
requirement for perfection or protection of Security or guarantees on transfers or assignments by
Finance Parties.

(c) No perfection action will be required in jurisdictions other than Spain.

2. **Terms of security documents**

The following terms will be reflected in the Transaction Security:

(a) the Transaction Security will be enforceable upon failure to pay any Secured Obligations or if an
Acceleration Event has occurred (provided that any common security that is shared with the
Senior Secured Notes or other Permitted Financial Indebtedness (which is permitted to share in
the Transaction Security) may also be enforced where permitted under documents evidencing
such indebtedness, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement);

**‘‘Acceleration Event’’ means the Agent, whilst an Event of Default is continuing and acting on the**
instructions of the Majority Lenders, gives notice that outstanding amounts under the Facilities
are immediately due and payable (or, having previously placed outstanding amounts on demand,
makes demand for payment).

(b) Transaction Security will only secure the direct borrowing and guarantee obligations of the
Obligor granting the security;

(c) the Transaction Security Documents shall only operate as instruments creating a security interest
rather than to impose new commercial obligations, accordingly they will not contain any
representations or undertakings or indemnities (such as in respect of title, ranking, insurance,
maintenance or protection of assets, information or the payment of costs) unless these are
expressly required by law for the creation or perfection of the security interest and are the same
(and no more onerous than) any equivalent provision in this Agreement;

(d) the Transaction Security Documents will not contain repeating representations;

(e) until an Acceleration Event, the pledgors shall be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights
to any shares pledged by them in a manner which does not materially adversely affect the validity
or enforceability of the security interest or the value of the secured assets and the pledgors shall
be permitted to receive payment of dividends and other payments and retain and use them for
any purpose not prohibited under this Agreement;

(f) the Security Agent shall only be able to exercise any power of attorney granted to it under the
Transaction Security Documents following the occurrence of an Acceleration Event or if an
Obligor, having been given reasonable notice by the Security Agent of any failure to comply, has
failed to comply with any further assurance or perfection obligation; and

(g) the Transaction Security Documents shall not operate so as to prevent any transaction otherwise
permitted under this Agreement; the Transaction Security Documents will not prevent the
disposal of shares where such disposal is permitted under this Agreement and will include
assurances that the Security Agent will do all such things as reasonably requested (at the cost of
the Group) to release security in respect of shares and assets the subject of such disposal.

3. **Guarantee limitations**

The following terms will be taken into account in the accession of any Additional Guarantor.
Guarantees shall not be created or perfected to the extent that:

(a) it would be unlawful (including, without limitation, under corporate benefit, thin capitalisation,
fraudulent preference, ‘‘earnings stripping’’, financial assistance or similar laws) or would result

A-233


-----

in (or in the opinion of the Company acting reasonably there is a material risk that it would result
in) personal or criminal liability for the directors or officers of the relevant Subsidiary or other
members of the Group for a Subsidiary to become a Guarantor;

(b) it would result in (or there is in the opinion of the Company acting reasonably a material risk that
it would result in) a material cost (including, without limitation, by way of adverse effects on
interest deductibility or stamp duty, notarisation and registration fees) that would be
disproportionate to the benefit that will be obtained by the beneficiaries of that guarantee or the
procedural requirements involved or potential legal or commercial consequences for the
Subsidiary were it to become a Guarantor would be disproportionate to the benefit that will be
obtained by the beneficiaries of that guarantee;

(c) it would result in (or there is a material risk in the opinion of the Company acting reasonably that
it would result in) a material tax cost on the Subsidiary or Group if the relevant Subsidiary
became a Guarantor that would be disproportionate to the benefit that will be obtained by the
beneficiaries of that guarantee;

(d) the Subsidiary is not wholly owned and accession as a Guarantor would contravene any applicable
shareholders’ agreement or other document binding on it; or

(e) the relevant Subsidiary is an American Subsidiary or is incorporated in India, China, Taiwan,
South Korea or Japan.

Where guarantees are granted by an Additional Guarantor the maximum guaranteed amount may be
limited to minimise stamp duty, notarisation, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties.

Upon delivery of a Further Secured Notice to the Security Agent in the required form the Company and the Security Agent shall enter into Additional Senior Financing Security Documents in favour of the Security Agent for and on behalf of or in favour of the relevant Additional Senior Financing Creditors.

 14.2 Additional Senior Liabilities

 (a) If:

 (i) any Senior Facility Lenders increase, add, supplement, amend, novate, extend or restate a facility under the Senior Facility Agreement or convert any uncommitted facility under the Senior Facility Agreement into a committed facility or make further advances to the extent permitted under the Senior Facility Agreement ("Additional Senior Facility Liabilities"), such Additional Senior Facility Liabilities will be deemed to be made under the terms of the Senior Facility Agreement and (to the extent permitted by applicable law) secured by the Senior Facility and Senior Secured Notes Security Documents; or

 (ii) any additional Senior Secured Notes are issued ("Additional Senior Secured Notes Liabilities"), such additional Senior Secured Notes will (to the extent permitted by applicable law) be secured by the Senior Facility and Senior Secured Notes Security Documents.

 (b) To the extent Additional Senior Facility Liabilities or Additional Senior Secured Notes Liabilities (together "Additional Senior Liabilities") incurred as contemplated in paragraph (a) above cannot be secured pari passu with the then existing Senior Facility Liabilities and Senior Secured Notes Liabilities under the Senior Facility and Senior Secured Notes Security Documents, such Additional Senior Liabilities may (to the extent permitted by applicable law), and shall in the case of any Additional Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, be secured pursuant to the execution of additional Transaction Security Documents granting Security over the Secured Shares on a lesser ranking basis, but will nevertheless continue, for the purpose of this Agreement, to be considered as having being secured pari passu with the then existing Senior Facility Liabilities and Senior Secured Notes Liabilities.

 (c) If any Bilateral Facility Lender increases, adds, supplements, amends, novates, extends or restates a facility under a Bilateral Facility Agreement or makes further advances to the extent permitted under the Bilateral Facility Agreement ("Further Bilateral Liabilities"), such Further Bilateral Liabilities will be deemed to be made under the terms of the relevant Bilateral Facility Agreement and (to the extent permitted by applicable law) secured by the Security Documents.

 (d) To the extent Further Bilateral Liabilities incurred as contemplated in paragraph (a) above cannot be secured pari passu with the then existing Bilateral Facility Liabilities under the Bilateral Facility Security Documents,


-----

### such Further Bilateral Liabilities may (to the extent permitted by applicable law) be secured pursuant to the execution of additional Transaction Security Documents granting Security over the Secured Shares on a lesser ranking basis, but will nevertheless continue, for the purpose of this Agreement, to be considered as having being secured pari passu with the then existing Bilateral Facility Liabilities.

 (e) For the avoidance of doubt, any Additional Senior Liabilities incurred as contemplated in paragraph (a) above and any Further Bilateral Liabilities incurred as contemplated in paragraph (c) above shall not be deemed to create any separate class of Creditors for the purposes of this Agreement and the Creditors of such Additional Senior Liabilities or Further Bilateral Liabilities shall be treated for voting and all other purposes under this Agreement as Senior Creditors.

 (f) Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the Senior Creditors and the providers of Additional Senior Liabilities or Further Bilateral Liabilities from agreeing the ranking of their respective claims among themselves provided that unless otherwise agreed such Additional Senior Liabilities and Further Bilateral Liabilities shall rank pari passu with the other Senior Liabilities.

 14.3 Refinancing of the Senior Liabilities

 (a) Any of the Senior Facility Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Bilateral Facility Liabilities and the Additional Senior Financing Liabilities may be refinanced or replaced (a "Senior Refinancing") in whole or (if expressly permitted or not prohibited under the Senior Finance Documents) in part and any pari passu ranking indebtedness incurred by Debtors in respect of such Senior Refinancing will be subject to, and have the benefit of, this Agreement.

 (b) No Senior Refinancing shall benefit from any Security other than Transaction Security or from any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any member of the Group other than, to the extent legally possible, any Common Assurance.

 (c) The trustee or agent of a Senior Refinancing (if not already a Party) shall execute and deliver a Creditor/Creditor Representative Accession Undertaking before or concurrently with that Senior Refinancing being implemented.

 (d) The Parties acknowledge that the terms and conditions (including increased pricing and amount of principal) applicable to any such Senior Refinancing may be different to those applicable to the Senior Liabilities being refinanced, but, unless otherwise consented to by the relevant Senior Creditors, shall be required not to breach the terms of the other Senior Finance Documents.

 (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the Senior Creditors and the creditors in respect of any Senior Refinancing after consultation with the Company from agreeing the ranking of their respective claims among themselves provided that unless otherwise agreed the claims of the creditors against the Debtors in respect of any Senior Refinancing shall rank pari passu with the


-----

### claims of the other Senior Creditors against the Debtors.

 (f) Each Senior Creditor and the Company undertakes at the prior written request of the Security Agent (such request to be made by the Security Agent promptly upon receiving notice from the Company of any relevant Senior Financing and its compliance with the terms of this Clause 14.3) to promptly give such instructions to the Security Agent as may be reasonably necessary and promptly enter into any Intercreditor Amendment and to enter into further Security over the Secured Shares to provide substantially the same rights and remedies to the providers of such Senior Refinancing as those provided to the Senior Creditors in this Agreement, in each case, at the cost of the Company. A Creditor Representative, Bilateral Facility Lender or the Security Agent will only be required to execute any Intercreditor Amendment if it has received such legal opinions (as to capacity and authority of the Debtors and the legal, valid, binding and enforceable nature of the Intercreditor Amendment as against the Debtors and non-conflict) as the Creditor Representative, Bilateral Facility Lender or Security Agent may reasonably request and in a form satisfactory to them (acting reasonably) in connection with the execution of such Intercreditor Amendment and shall be under no obligation to execute such Intercreditor Amendment if it would impose personal liabilities or obligations in addition to those contemplated by this Agreement on, or adversely affect the rights, duties or immunities of, that Creditor Representative, Bilateral Facility Lender or Security Agent beyond what is contemplated by this Agreement.

 (g) In the event of a Senior Refinancing, references in this Agreement to provisions and clauses of the Senior Facility Agreement, any Additional Senior Financing Agreement, any Bilateral Facility Agreement or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (as the case may be) shall be construed as or in the case of a refinancing in part supplemented by references to equivalent provisions and clauses of the corresponding new facility or facilities agreement, indenture, trust deed, supplemental deed or other equivalent document documenting such Senior Refinancing.

**REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

To the Management of
Gestamp Automoci´on, S.A.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Gestamp Automoci´on, S.A. (the
Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial
position as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 and the consolidated income statements, the consolidated
statements of comprehensive income, the consolidated statements of changes in equity, the consolidated
statements of cash flow, and explanatory notes for the years then ended.

**Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union (‘‘IFRS—EU’’), and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.

**Auditor’s Responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted
our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s
internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.

GESTAMP AUTOMOCI ON, S.A., (hereinafter, the Company) was incorporated on December 22, 1997.[´]
Its registered address is currently in the Industrial Park of Lebario in Abadiano (Vizcaya).

Most of the Group’s business is conducted in the European Union; the Americas constitute the second

solely for the purpose of complying with the EU Prospectus Directive on historical information that should
be included in the ‘‘Prospectus’’ and for no other purpose. These consolidated financial statements have
been derived from the consolidated financial statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2012,
2011, and 2010, which were already reported under IFRS-EU.

**2.2 True and fair view**

The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union and
enacted in European Commission legislation in effect on December 31, 2012.

**GESTAMP AUTOMOCION, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES[´]**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (Continued)**

**2.** **Basis of preparation of the financial statements (Continued)**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the accounting records of each
group company as of December, 31 2012 and 2011. Each company prepares its Financial Statements in
accordance with the accounting principles and standards in force in the country in which it operates; the
required adjustments and reclassifications have been made in consolidation in order to harmonize the
policies and methods used and to adapt them to IFRS.

**2.3 Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company and
subsidiaries as per December 31, 2012.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be
consolidated until the date on which control is transferred outside the Group. If the Group loses or
relinquishes control of a subsidiary, the Consolidated Financial Statements include that subsidiary’s results
for the portion of the year during which the Group held control.

The breakdown of companies included in the consolidation scope, as well as information on the
consolidation method applied, location, activity, direct or indirect shareholdings and their auditors, is
shown in the Annex I.

The financial statements for the subsidiaries have the same financial year end as the parent’s,(except for
those mentioned on Annex I where an interim closing has been prepared for the purpose of including
these companies in the Consolidated Financial Statements) and have been prepared using the same
accounting standards.

The profit of a subsidiary is attributed to non-controlling interest even if it means recognizing a receivable
balance.

Changes in percentage of ownership interest that do not represent loss of control are reflected as an equity
transaction. When the Group loses control of a subsidiary it:

- Derecognizes assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of said subsidiary.

- Derecognizes carrying amount of non-controlling interests.

- Derecognizes the translation differences recognized in equity.

- Recognizes the fair value of the amount received for the transaction.

- Recognizes the fair value of any retained investment.

- Recognizes any excess or deficit in the consolidated income statement.

- Reclassifies the shareholding of the Company in the items previously recognized in ‘‘Other
Comprehensive Income’’ to profit or to retained earnings, as appropriate.

_Subsidiaries_

The full consolidation method is used for companies meeting the following requirements:

I. Companies in which the Company holds a direct or indirect interest of over 50%, which gives it more
than half the voting rights on the entity’s governing bodies.

II. Companies over which the Company exercises effective management control, irrespective of the
shareholding percentage, by virtue of holding the majority of voting rights on the entity’s governing
bodies.

**2.** **Basis of preparation of the financial statements (Continued)**

_Jointly controlled entities_

Jointly controlled entities or interests in joint ventures are consolidated using the proportionate
consolidation method until the date on which the Group ceases to have joint control over the venture.

A jointly controlled entity is a business over which the Group exercises joint control.

_Associates_

Investments in which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control have been
consolidated under the equity method. For the purposes of the preparation of the accompanying financial
statements, significant influence is deemed to exist in investments in which the Group, directly or
indirectly, holds over 20% of the voting power, and in certain instances where the Group’s holding is less
than 20%, but significant influence can be clearly demonstrated.

Companies in which the Company’s direct or indirect holding is between 20% and 50%, but in which it
does not hold the majority of voting rights or in which it does not have effective control or joint control
with another non-Group company, are consolidated using the equity method.

_Translation of the financial statements of foreign operations_

The assets and liabilities and income statements of foreign operations included in the consolidation scope
whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency are translated to euro using the
closing foreign exchange rates method as follows:

- The assets, rights, and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at
the consolidated balance sheet date.

- Income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate, so long as that average is a
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the actual exchange rates prevailing at the
transaction dates.

The differences between the net book value of equity of the foreign companies converted using historical
exchange rates and including the net result from the income statement reflecting the above mentioned
treatment of income and expenses in foreign currencies, and the net book value of equity resulting from
the conversion of assets, rights and liabilities using the exchange rate prevailing at the consolidated balance
sheet date, are registered as ‘‘Translation differences’’, with the corresponding negative or positive sign, in
Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (Note 16).

Exchange gains and losses due to the impact of changes in the functional currency relative to the euro on
foreign currency borrowings considered permanent are taken directly to equity under ‘‘Translation
differences’’, net of the tax effect. The net amount of positive translation differences, including the tax
effect, at December 31, 2012, amounted to 8.2 million euros (2011:17 million euros in negative translation
differences; 2010: 42 million euros).

At December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 the subsidiaries held no equity units issued by the Company.

The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, when presenting the statement of cash flows by indirect
method, has been calculated considering an average for the year of Cash and cash equivalents and applying
the change of foreign exchange rates at closing of each year.

_Transactions between companies included in the consolidation scope_

The following transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation:

- Reciprocal receivables/payables and expenses/income relating to intra-Group transactions.

- Income from the purchase and sale of property, plant, and equipment as well as unrealized gains on
inventories, if the amount is significant.

**2.** **Basis of preparation of the financial statements (Continued)**

- Intra-Group dividends and the debit balance corresponding to interim dividends recognized at the
company that paid them.

_Non-controlling interest_

The value of non-controlling interests in the equity and profit (loss) for the year of consolidated
subsidiaries consolidated by the full consolidation method is recognized in ‘‘Equity attributable to noncontrolling interests’’ within the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in ‘‘Profit for the year attributable to
non-controlling interests’’ in the Consolidated Income Statement and in ‘‘Non-controlling interests’’ in the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, respectively.

**2.4 Summary of significant accounting policies**

The principal accounting policies used in preparing the 2012, 2011, and 2010 consolidated financial
statements were as follows:

**_a)_** **_Foreign currency transactions_**

_Functional and presentation currency_

Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency, which is the currency of the primary
economic environment in which it operates, and line items included in the financial statements of each
entity are valued using that functional currency.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of euros, as the Euro is the Group’s
presentation currency and the functional currency of the parent company.

_Transactions in foreign currency different to the functional currency of each company._

Transactions in foreign currencies different to the functional currency of each company are translated to
the Group’s functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Exchange
gains and losses arising on the settlement of these transactions or on translating foreign currency
denominated monetary assets and liabilities at closing rates are recognized in the Consolidated Income
Statement.

**_b)_** **_Property, plant and equipment_**

Property, plant, and equipment is carried at either acquisition, transition cost to IFRS (January 1, 2007), or
production cost, including all the costs and expenses directly related with assets acquired until ready for
use, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Land is not depreciated and is presented
net of any impairment charges.

Acquisition cost includes:

- Purchase Price.

- Discounts for prompt payment, which are deducted from the asset’s carrying value.

- Directly attributable costs incurred to ready the asset for use.

Prior to the IFRS transition date (January 1, 2007), certain Group companies revalued certain items of
property, plant, and equipment as permitted under applicable legislation (Royal Decree-Law 7/1996,
Basque regional law 6/1996 and several international laws). The amount of these revaluations is considered
part of the cost of the assets as provided for under IAS 1.

At the transition date to EU-IFRSs (January 1, 2007), property, plant and equipment was measured at fair
value at the said date, based on the appraisals of an independent expert, which generated a revaluation of
Group assets (Note 7).

The carrying value of property, plant, and equipment acquired by means of a business combination is
measured by its fair value at the moment of its incorporation into the Group (Note 2.4c).

**GESTAMP AUTOMOCION, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES[´]**

**FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (Continued)**

**2.** **Basis of preparation of the financial statements (Continued)**

Specific spare parts: certain major parts of some items of plant and equipment may require replacement at
irregular intervals. The cost of these parts is capitalized when the part is replaced and depreciated over
their estimated useful lives. The net carrying amount of replaced parts is retired with a charge to income
when the replacement occurs.

Ordinary repair or maintenance work is not capitalized.

An item of property, plant, and equipment is retired upon disposal or when no future economic benefits
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on retirement of the asset (calculated as the
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the net carrying amount of the asset) is included in the
income statement in the year the asset is retired.

As permitted under revised IAS 23, borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or development
of a qualifying asset—an asset that takes more than one year to be ready for its intended use—are
capitalized as part of the cost of the respective assets.

Annual depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the
various assets.

The estimated useful lives of the various asset categories are:

**Years of**
**estimated**
**useful life**

Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17 to 50
Plant and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 to 15
Other plant, tools and furniture . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 to 10
Other PP&E items . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 to 10

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each financial year end, and adjusted
prospectively if revised expectations differ significantly from previous estimates.

**_c)_** **_Business combinations and goodwill_**

**Business combinations**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The acquisition cost is the sum of
the total consideration transferred, measured at fair value at the acquisition date, and the amount of
non-controlling interest of the acquired company, if any.

For each business combination, the Group measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at
fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

Acquisition costs incurred are registered under the heading ‘‘Other operating expenses’’ in the
Consolidated Income Statement.

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate
classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and
pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date, included the separation of implicit derivatives financial
instruments of the main contracts of the acquired company.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured, at the time of acquisition, at cost, that is,
the excess of the total consideration paid for the business combination over the Company’s interest in the
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of the acquired business.

For companies whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency, the value of the
goodwill recognized is updated using the rate of exchange prevailing at the Consolidated Balance Sheet

date, recognizing in Translation differences the differences between beginning and ending balances,
according to IAS 21, considered to be belonging to the acquired business assets.

If the Company’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable acquired assets, assumed liabilities, and
contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the Company reconsiders the
identification and measurement of the assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of the acquired company,
as well as the measurement of the cost of the business combination when non monetary. The Company
recognizes any excess that continues to exist after this reconsideration in the income statement.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is
tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may be impaired.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition
date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units expected to
benefit from the business combination’s synergies, irrespective of any other Group assets or liabilities
assigned to those units or groups of units.

Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit or groups of
cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit
or group of cash-generating units is less than the carrying amount, the Group recognizes an impairment
loss (Note 2.4g).

**_d)_** **_Jointly controlled entities_**

The Group has several participations in jointly controlled entities, businesses over which the Group
exercises joint control, where contractual agreements exist.

The contracts require that the agreement between the parties with respect the operating and financial
decisions be unanimous. Jointly controlled entities are consolidated using the proportionate consolidation
method.

The Group integrates in the Consolidated Financial Statements its shareholding percentage over the
assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the joint venture in similar items.

The financial statements of the joint venture are prepared for the same period than the Group; the
required adjustments and reclassifications have been made in consolidation in order to harmonize the
policies and methods used by the Group.

The consolidated financial statements include the adjustments to eliminate their participation in balances,
transactions and profits and losses between the Group and its joint venture. Transactions losses are
recognized immediately if the loss reflects a reduction in the net realizable value of current assets or an
impairment loss.

The joint venture is proportionately consolidated until the date that the Group ceases to exercise joint
control over it. Once the joint control is ceased, the Group measures and recognizes investments held at
fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the investment that was jointly controlled and
the fair value of the investment held, including the sale income, is recognized in the Consolidated Income
Statement.

Investments in which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, are consolidated
under the equity method.

**_e)_** **_Other intangible assets_**

Other intangible assets acquired by the Group are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any
accumulated impairment losses.

**GESTAMP AUTOMOCION, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES[´]**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (Continued)**

**2.** **Basis of preparation of the financial statements (Continued)**

An intangible asset is recognized only if it is probable that it will generate future benefits for the Group
and that its cost can be reliably measured.

_Research and development costs_

Research costs are expensed as incurred.

Development expenditure is capitalized when the Group can demonstrate:

- the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;

- its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the resulting asset;

- its ability to use or sell the intangible asset;

- the economic and commercial profitability of the project is reasonably ensured;

- the availability of adequate technical and financial resources to complete and to use or sell the
resulting asset; and

- its ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development.

Capitalized development costs are amortized over the period of expected future benefits.

_Concessions, patents, licenses and trademarks._

These intangible assets are initially measured at acquisition cost. They are assessed as having a finite useful
life and are accordingly carried at cost net of accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated using
the straight-line method, based on the estimated useful life, in all instances less than 5 years.

_Software_

Software is measured at acquisition cost.

Software acquired from third parties and capitalized is amortized over its useful life, which in no instance
will exceed 5 years.

IT maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

**_f)_** **_Financial assets_**

Financial assets are initially measured at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs.

The Group classifies its financial assets, current and non-current, into the following categories:

- Financial assets at fair value, with changes through the income statement (held for trading).

- Held-to-maturity investments.

- Loans and receivables.

- Available-for-sale financial assets.

- Investments in associates accounted for using the equity method.

Classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management
determines the classification of its financial assets upon initial recognition and reassesses this designation
at each year end.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (Continued)**

**2.** **Basis of preparation of the financial statements (Continued)**

_Financial assets at fair value with changes through the income statement (held for trading)_

These are financial assets held for trading. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are
acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. This category includes derivative financial
instruments, except those designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge.

They are classified as non-current assets and are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in
value of these assets are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement as Financial gains or losses.

Fair value is the market price at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date.

_Held-to-maturity investments_

Financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as held-to-maturity
when the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold them to maturity.

They are classified as non-current, except for those maturing in less than 12 months from the balance sheet
date. They are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment charges.

_Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market. They are classified as current, except for those maturing in more than 12 months from the
balance sheet date.

They are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment charges.

_Available-for-sale financial assets_

There are financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified in any of the three
preceding categories. They are classified as non-current unless management plans to dispose of them
within 12 months from the balance sheet date.

They are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. Unrealized gains or losses are recognized
directly in equity until the investment is retired or is impair, at which time the cumulative gain or loss
recorded in equity is recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement.

_Investments in associates accounted for using the equity method_

Investments in associates, companies in which the Group has significant influence, are accounted for using
the equity method.

According to the equity method, the investment is recognized initially at cost. From the acquisition date
on, the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted in accordance with any changes in Group’s interest in
the associate. Goodwill related to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and it
is not amortized and no impairment test related is done.

If the resulting amount of the investment valuation is negative, the Group’s investment in the associate is
written down to zero in the consolidated balance sheet unless there is a commitment by the Group to
replenish the company’s equity, in which case the corresponding provision for contingencies and charges is
recognized.

The share of the Group in profits of operations of associates is reflected in the Consolidated Income
Statement. Where there has been a change recognized directly in equity by the associate, the Group
recognizes its share of this change, when applicable, in ‘‘Other comprehensive Income’’ and discloses this,
when applicable, in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.

Non-realized gains or losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate
corresponding to the share of the Group in the associate are eliminated.

**GESTAMP AUTOMOCION, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES[´]**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (Continued)**

**2.** **Basis of preparation of the financial statements (Continued)**

The share of the Group in profits of associates is reflected directly in the consolidated income statement
and represents profit after taxes and non-controlling interests.

Financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same period that for the Group and with all
necessary adjustments in order to homogenize to Group’s accounting policies.

After using the equity method, the Group decides if impairment losses on investments in associates have to
be recognized. At closing date, the Group consider if there is evidence of impairment of the investment in
the associate and if so, the impairment is calculated as the difference between the recoverable value and
the carrying amount of the associate and the amount of such impairment is recognized in ‘‘Share of profits
from associates- equity method’’ in the consolidated income statement.

When the significant influence of the Group in the associate ceases, the Group recognizes the investment
at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant
influence and the fair value of the investment plus the income for sale is recognized in the consolidated
income statement.

_Derecognition of financial instruments_

The Group retires a transferred financial asset from the Consolidated Balance Sheet when it has
transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or, retaining these rights, when the Group has
assumed a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to a third party, and the Group has transferred
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset.

If the entity has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset, the
entity does not retire the transferred asset from its balance sheet and recognizes a financial liability for the
consideration received. This financial liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost. The transferred
financial asset continues to be measured using the same criteria as prior to the transfer. In subsequent
periods, the Group recognizes any income on the transferred asset and any expense incurred on the
financial liability in the consolidated income statement. Such income and expense are not offset.

**_g)_** **_Impairment of assets_**

_Impairment of non-financial assets_

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If
any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the
asset’s recoverable amount as either the group of assets’ or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to
sell, or its value in use, whichever is higher.

A cash-generating unit (CGU) is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash flows that are
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets.

When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is
recognized.

Impairment losses with respect to CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the CGUs and, then, to reduce proportionally the carrying amount of the assets of the CGU
unless, based on a review of the individual assets, it is considered that their fair value less costs to sell is
higher than their carrying amount.

When assessing value in use, estimated future cash-flows are discounted to present value by using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market valuations of money and risks specific to the asset. For
calculating the fair value of the asset less costs to sell, recent transactions are considered and if they cannot
be identified, a proper valuation method is used. These calculations are based on several considerations,
market prices and other available indicators of the fair value.

**GESTAMP AUTOMOCION, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES[´]**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (Continued)**

**2.** **Basis of preparation of the financial statements (Continued)**

The calculation of impairment is based on detailed budgets and forecasts separately prepared for each
CGU to which the asset is allocated. Those budgets and forecasts refer to a five-year period and for longer
periods a long-term growing rate is calculated and used for estimating cash-flows after the fifth year.

The impairment losses from continued operations, including impairment of inventories, are recognized in
the consolidated income statement in the expenses related to the function of the impaired asset.

For all assets except goodwill, an assessment is made every year to see if there is evidence that the
impairment registered in previous years has been reduced or has disappeared. In such case, the Group
estimates the recoverable value of the asset or the CGU.

A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed, with the reversal recognized in the income statement,
if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount. The
restated recoverable amount of the asset cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined had no impairment loss been recognized.

The following assets present specific characteristics when assessing their impairment:

_Goodwill_

At year end as well as when there is evidence that goodwill may be impaired, it is tested for impairment.

The impairment tests for the goodwill assess the recoverable value of each CGU which it has been
allocated to it. If the recoverable value of the CGU is lower than the goodwill’s carrying amount, an
impairment loss is registered.

Goodwill impairment losses cannot be reversed in future periods.

_Intangible assets_

The Group has implemented annual procedures to test intangible assets with indefinite useful life for
impairment. This assessment is carried out for each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs, as well as when there
is evidence that intangible assets may be impaired.

_Impairment of financial assets_

The reduction in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets that has been recognized directly in
equity when there is objective evidence of impairment must be recognized in the consolidated income
statement for the year. The cumulative loss recognized in the income statement is measured as the
difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value.

Once an equity investment classified as available-for-sale has been impaired, any increase in value is
registered in ‘‘Other comprehensive income’’ with no effect on the profit or loss for the year.

In the case of debt instruments classified as available-for-sale assets, if the fair value of an impaired debt
instrument subsequently increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after
the impairment loss was recognized in the income statement, the impairment loss is reversed through the
income statement.

The recoverable amount of held-to-maturity investments and loans and receivables carried at amortized
cost is calculated as the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the original effective
interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account and the
amount of the loss is recognized in the consolidated income statement. Current investments are not
discounted to present value.

Impairment losses on loans and receivables carried at amortized cost are reversed if the subsequent
increase in the recoverable amount can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment
loss was recognized.

**2.** **Basis of preparation of the financial statements (Continued)**

**_h)_** **_Trade and other receivables_**

Accounts receivable from customers are measured in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at
nominal value.

Discounted bills pending maturity at year end are included in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets under ‘‘Trade receivables,’’ with a balancing entry in ‘‘Interest-bearing loans and borrowings’’. The
balances transferred to banks as Non-Recourse Factoring are not included in ‘‘Trade receivables’’ since all
risks related to them have been transferred to the bank.

The Group recognizes impairment allowances on balances past-due over certain periods, or when other
circumstances warrant their classification as impaired.

**_i)_** **_Inventories_**

Inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition or production cost and net realizable value.

Cost includes all expenses derived from the acquisition and transformation of inventories, including any
other expenses incurred to bring them to their present condition and location.

Inventories have been valued using the average weighted cost method.

When inventories are deemed impaired, their initially recognized value is written down to net realizable
value (selling price less estimated costs of completion and sale).

**_j)_** **_Tools made to customer order_**

A construction contract is a contract specifically negotiated with a customer for the construction of an asset
or a combination of assets that are closely interrelated or interdependent in terms of their design,
technology and function or their ultimate purpose or use.

When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue and contract
costs associated with the construction contract are recognized by reference to the stage of completion of
the contract activity at the balance sheet date (Note 2.4q).

Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognized to the
extent that contract costs incurred are expected to be recoverable.

Based on its experience and Group estimates, with rare exceptions, management does not expect to incur
losses, which have not been recognized on these Financial Statements, on the definitive settlement of the
tool manufacture contracts in progress at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

In the exceptional cases where there are contract costs that may not be recovered, no revenue is recognized
and all amounts of such costs are recognized as an expense immediately.

Customer advances received reflect billing milestones and not necessarily the stage of completion of the
contract.

Tools-in-progress measured using the stage of completion method are recognized under ‘‘Trade
receivables’’ net of customer advances with a balancing entry to ‘‘Revenue from tool sales’’.

**_k)_** **_Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with short-term, highly
liquid investments that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. An investment is considered
a cash equivalent when it has a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition or
establishment.

**2.** **Basis of preparation of the financial statements (Continued)**

**_l)_** **_Goverment grants_**

Government grants are recognized at fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be
received and all attached conditions will be complied with.

Where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognized as deferred income in the consolidated balance sheet
and released to income over the expected useful life of the related asset.

When the grant relates to income, it is recognized directly in the Consolidated Income Statement.

**_m)_** **_Financial liabilities (trade and other payables and borrowings)_**

Financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value less attributable transaction costs. After initial
recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost, measured
as the difference between their cost and redemption value, using the effective interest rate method.

Liabilities maturing in less than 12 months from the consolidated balance sheet date are classified as
current, while those with longer maturity periods are classified as non-current.

A financial liability is retired when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.

**_n)_** **_Provisions and contingent liabilities_**

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or implicit) as a result of past
events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Provisions are reviewed at each consolidated balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best
estimate of the liability.

Headcount restructuring provisions are stated at the amount of expenses expected to arise from the
restructuring and any other expenses not associated with the entity’s day-to-day business.

Headcount restructuring provisions are only recognized when there is a formal plan identifying the
affected business, the main locations affected, the employees to receive redundancy payments, the outlays
to be incurred, when it will be implemented, and when the entity has raised a valid expectation that it will
carry out the restructuring and those affected have been informed.

The provisions are determined by discounting expected future cash outlays using the pre-tax market rate
and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. This method is only applied if the effects are
significant. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized
as a financial expense.

Contingent liabilities are potential obligations that arise from past events whose existence will be
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not within the
control of the Group, as well as present obligations arising from past events, the amount of which cannot
be reliably estimated or whose settlement may not require an outflow of resources.

**_o)_** **_Employee benefits_**

The Group has assumed pension commitments for some companies belonging to the Edscha and the
Gestamp Metal Forming Subgroups located in Germany and France (Note 21).

The group classifies its pension commitments depending on their nature in defined contribution plans and
defined benefit plans. Defined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which the
company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (insurance company or pension plan), and will have
no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the separate company does not carry out
its assumed commitments. Defined benefit plans are post-employments benefit plans other than defined
contribution plans.

**FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (Continued)**

**2.** **Basis of preparation of the financial statements (Continued)**

_Defined contribution plans_

The Group carries out predetermined contributions into a separate entity (insurance company or pension
plan), and will have no legal or implicit obligation to pay further contributions if the separate company
does not have enough assets to attend employee benefits related to their services rendered in current and
previous years.

The contributions made to defined contribution plans are recognized in profit and loss according to
accrual principle.

_Defined benefit plans_

For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing these benefits is determined separately for each plan using
the projected unit credit method. The projected unit credit method is used to make reliable estimates of
the ultimate cost to the entity of the benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the
current and prior periods. The actuarial gains and losses are recognized in OCI (Other Comprehensive
Income) when incurred. In subsequent years, these actuarial gains and losses are registered in reserves,
and are not reclassified in profit and loss.

The amounts to be recognized in profit and loss are:

- Current service cost.

- Any past service cost and gains or losses upon payment.

- Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) which is determined by applying the discount
rate to the net defined benefit liability (asset).

The past service costs will be recognized as expenses at the earlier of the following dates (i) in the period
when the plan is amended or curtailment occurs (ii) when the Group recognizes related restructuring costs
or benefits of termination.

The net defined benefit liability (asset) is the deficit or surplus, detailed below, adjusted for any effect of
limiting a net defined benefit asset to the asset ceiling. The asset ceiling is the present value of any
economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to
the plan.

The rate used to discount post-employment benefit obligations shall be determined by reference to market
yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds.

The deficit or surplus is:

- The present value of the defined benefit obligation.

- Less the fair value of plan assets (if any).

Plan assets comprise assets held by a long-term employee benefit fund, and qualifying insurance policies.
These assets are not available to the reporting entity’s own creditors and cannot be returned to the
reporting entity. Fair value is based on market price and in case of stock market values, it corresponds to
published prices.

Indemnities to pay to employees dismissed through no fault of their own are calculated based on years of
service. Any expenses incurred for indemnities are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement as soon
as they are known.

**_p)_** **_Leases_**

Leases in which all the risks and benefits associated with ownership of the asset are substantially
transferred are classified as finance leases.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (Continued)**

**2.** **Basis of preparation of the financial statements (Continued)**

Assets acquired under financial lease arrangements are recognized, based on their nature, at the lower of
the fair value of the leased item and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the outset of the
lease term. A financial liability is recognized for the same amount. Lease payments are apportioned
between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability. Leased assets are depreciated, impaired, and
retired using the same criteria applied to assets of a similar nature

Leases where the lessor substantially retains all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are
classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense in the Consolidated
Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.

**_q)_** **_Revenue and expense recognition_**

Revenue and expenses are recognized when products are delivered or services are provided, regardless of
when actual payment or collection occurs.

Revenue is recognized at fair value of the balancing entry, defining fair value as the amount for which an
asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length
transaction, taking into account the amount of any discounts or rebates provided.

Revenue includes:

- Sale of goods: Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the following conditions have been
met:

  - the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the
goods;

  - the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated
with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;

  - the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

  - it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group;

  - the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be reliably measured.

- Manufacture of tools for third party sale and rendering of services: revenue arising from the
manufacture of tools for sale to third parties and the rendering of services are recognized by reference
to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date—stage of completion method
(Note 2.4j).

- Interest, royalties, and dividends: interest revenue is recognized as interest accrues taking into account
the effective return of the asset (using the effective interest method, i.e., the rate that makes
discounted future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument equal to the
initial carrying amount of the asset).

Royalties are recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant
agreement.

Dividends are recognized when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is established.

Expenses are recognized when there is a decrease in the value of an asset or an increase in the value of a
liability that can be measured reliably, and they are recognized during the period in which they are
incurred.

**_r)_** **_Income tax_**

The income tax recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement includes current and deferred income
tax.

**GESTAMP AUTOMOCION, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES[´]**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (Continued)**

**2.** **Basis of preparation of the financial statements (Continued)**

Income tax expense is recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement except for current income tax
relating to line items in shareholders’ equity, which is recognized in equity and not in the income
statement.

_Current tax_

Current tax expense is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit for the year and
is calculated based on net profit for the year before deducting tax expense (accounting profit), increased or
decreased, as appropriate, by permanent and temporary differences between accounting and taxable profit
as provided for in prevailing tax legislation.

_Tax credits_

The carry forward of unused tax credits and tax losses is recognized as a reduction in tax expense, unless
there is reasonable doubt as to their realization, in which case they are not capitalized and are considered
as a decrease in income tax expense in the year in which they are applied or offset.

_Temporary differences_

Deferred tax liabilities: a deferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except to
the extent that the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and which, at the
time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor the fiscal result.

Deferred tax assets: a deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent
that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference
can be utilized, unless the deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
transaction that is not a business combination and which, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the
accounting nor the fiscal result.

**_s)_** **_Derivative financial instruments_**

The Company has arranged cash flow (interest rate) hedges through entities that operate on organized
markets. These instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates on a
portion of the bank loans granted to the Company and on a portion of expected future borrowings.

In addition, the Company holds hedges contracted for net foreign investments to cover the exposure to
changes in exchange rates with respect to the interest in the net assets of foreign operations.

These financial derivatives hedging cash flow and net foreign investments are initially recognized in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet at acquisition cost and, subsequently, they are marked to market.

Any gains or losses arising from changes in the market value of derivatives in respect of the ineffective
portion of an effective hedge are taken directly to the consolidated income statement, while gains or losses
on the effective portion are recognized in ‘‘Effective hedges’’ within ‘‘Retained earnings’’ with respect to
cash flow hedges, and in ‘‘Translation differences’’ with respect to net foreign investment hedges. The
cumulative gain or loss recognized in equity is taken to the Consolidated Income Statement when the
hedged item affects profit or loss or in the year of disposal of the item.

Derivatives are recognized as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is
negative.

**_t)_** **_Related parties_**

The Group considers its direct and indirect shareholders, its associated companies, its directors and its
officers as related parties.

**2.** **Basis of preparation of the financial statements (Continued)**

Companies belonging to the majority shareholder of the Company are also considered related parties.

**_u)_** **_Environmental issues_**

Expenses relating to decontamination and restoration work in polluted areas, as well as the elimination of
waste and other expenses incurred to comply with the environmental protection legislation, are registered
in the year they are incurred, unless they correspond to the acquisition cost of assets to be used over an
extended period. In this case, they are recognized in the corresponding heading under ‘‘Property, plant,
and equipment’’ and are depreciated using the same criteria described in Note 2.4b above.

Estimable amounts of contingent liabilities for environmental issues, if any, would be provisioned as a
liability in Consolidated Balance Sheet.

**2.5 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures**

**a)** **Standards and interpretations adopted by the European Union this financial year**

The accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year

**2.** **Basis of preparation of the financial statements (Continued)**

The Group is currently analyzing the impact of applying these new standards, amendments, and
interpretations. Based on the analyses carried out to date, the Group considers that the application of
these standards and amendments will not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements in the initial period of application.

**c)** **Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and not yet approved by the European Union**

At the date of publication of these Consolidated Financial Statements, the following IFRSs and
amendments had been issued by the IASB but were not mandatory and had not been approved by the

interpretations. Based on the analyses carried out to date, the Group considers that the application of
these standards and amendments will not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements in the initial period of application.

**3.** **Significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions**

The preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements under IFRS requires
management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect:

- The reported amounts of assets and liabilities.

- The disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the reporting date.

- The reported amounts of revenue and expenses throughout the year.

The key estimates and assumptions that have a significant impact on the accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements are as follows:

- The valuation of assets and goodwill for the purposes of determining any impairment losses.

- Specifically in relation to the assumptions used to estimate EBITDA at the CGUs, management used
the most conservative scenarios so that adjustments to carrying amounts in this regard are considered
unlikely (Note 2.4g).

- At the transition date, the fair value of the Group’s land and buildings was determined by an
independent appraiser (Note 2.4b).

- The likelihood and quantification of indeterminate and contingent liabilities (Note 2.4n).

- Calculation of income tax expense and recognition of deferred tax assets: the correct measurement of
income tax expense depends on a number of factors, including timing estimates in relation to the
application of deferred tax assets and the accrual of income tax payments. The actual timing of
payments and collections could differ from these estimates as a result of changes in tax regulations or
in planned/future transactions with an impact on the tax base of the Group’s assets.

Although these estimates have been made based on the best information available regarding the facts
analyzed at the reporting date, events may occur in the future that require adjustments to be made
prospectively in subsequent years to reflect the effect of the revised estimates. Nevertheless, management

does not expect any such adjustments to have a material impact on its future Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In terms of current and non-current provisions (Note 20), the Group did not change any of the estimates
used to calculate these balances under IFRS.

**4.** **Changes in consolidation scope and business combinations**

50% of this company’s share capital; as a consequence the company’s consolidated method applied for this
company was changed as of January 1, 2010 from the equity method to proportionate consolidation. The
Group also increased its investment in Gestamp Manufacturing Autochasis, S.L. from 50% to 100% and

The payment was fully disbursed in cash.

No goodwill arose from the acquisition and there are no significant contingent payments. The net effect of
the business combination has been registered under the heading ‘‘Other operating expenses’’ in the
consolidated income statement as of December 31, 2011 (Note 26.c).

Additionally, when the Group obtained control, there was a net debt at ALHC, LLC. with the acquiring
company Gestamp North America, Inc., in the amount of 29,968 thousand euros, included in the previous
Balance Sheet, mainly, under the heading ‘‘Other non-current liabilities’’.

The revenue and net income of the acquired business reflected in the consolidated financial statements
from the date of incorporation into the consolidation scope to December 31, 2011 amounted to
148,274 thousand euros and 8,314 thousand euros in profit, respectively, including the net effect on income
of the business combination amounting to 1,824 thousand euros of profit. The headcount of this newly
incorporated business amounted to approximately 193.

There were no significant transaction related expenses in connection with this acquisition.

With regard to all of the aforementioned business combinations, the principal assessment criteria utilized
in calculating the fair value of the different accounting line items are as follows:

_Intangible assets:_ measured at acquisition cost, which approximates their fair value.

_Property, plant, and equipment:_ in the case of the Gestamp Metal Forming Subgroup, the fixed assets were
valued according to their utility, considering an estimated remaining useful life of 7 years, given that the
bulk of the fixed assets is machinery, and considering discount rates of between 10.8% and 14.5%
depending on the country. The utility valuation was also verified using an appraisal by an independent
expert who used market values for land and buildings and replacement value for the remaining fixed assets.

For the other business combinations the fixed asset valuations were based on independent third party
reports. Market valuations served as the underlying criteria for the determination of fair value.

_Inventories of raw materials:_ measured based on acquisition cost, which also approximates replacement
value.

_Inventories of finished products:_ measured based on production cost, which also approximates
replacement value.

_Trade receivables and trade accounts payable:_ measured at nominal value.

_Current and non-current provisions:_ measured based on the present value of the expected future necessary
cash payments.

**Acquisitions in 2010**

On April 1, 2010, after having received the required approvals, the Group consummated the purchase of
100% of the Body Components business unit of Edscha Subgroup, according to which the Group acquired
the material assets and inventories held by companies in EU countries (Germany, Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Spain, France and Portugal), assumed existing contracts with clients and suppliers, incorporated
the existing staff, as well as investments in companies located in Brazil, China, Taiwan and Japan.

This transaction enhanced the Group’s technological positioning vis-`a-vis its clients and added an entirely
new product category to its existing portfolio, a category in which the acquired business unit is the market
leader worldwide.

The transaction was executed in the context of the liquidation process carried out by the official receiver of
the sellers which reside in the European Union. The liquidation process took place in the context of
bankruptcy proceedings which began in February 2009.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (Continued)**

**6.** **Intangible assets (Continued)**

Currency translation differences correspond to adjustments to the goodwill of companies having a
functional currency other than the euro,translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the Consolidated
Balance Sheet date, in accordance with IAS 21 (Note 2.4a).

Decreases in period ended December 31, 2012 correspond to Continental Group, Ltd. dissolution
(Note 4.2).

In 2012, the group company Gestamp Tooling Overseas Design India, Ltd., changed its name to Gestamp
Services India Private, Ltd. In addition, the group company Gestamp Paran´a, S.A. changed its name to
Gestamp Brasil Industria de Autope¸cas, S.A. (Note 4.2).

The increase reflected as other movements in 2010 corresponds to the change in the consolidation method
of the subsidiary Gestamp Sungwoo Automotive (Chennai) Pvt. Ltd. The increase in the shareholding in
this Company from 20% to 50% leads to consolidation under proportionate method in 2010 instead of
under equity method in 2009. As a consequence, the implicit goodwill contained in this investment for
833 thousand euros is taken to Goodwill.

Additions in 2010 correspond to the goodwill arising from the increase in the ownership stake in this
company in 2010.

Decreases in 2010 refer to the disposal of the goodwill from Automotive Stampings & Assemblies, Ltd.
since the Group’s interest in this Company has been sold.

**Impairment test of Goodwill**

The Group has implemented annual procedures to test goodwill for impairment. This assessment is carried
out for each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.

For each CGU, these calculations are made using cash flow projections for the cash-generating unit based
on current operating results and business plans covering a five-year period. The pre-tax discount rates used
for the cash flow projections in 2012 range from 8.66% to 11.02% for western European companies (in
2011 the range was from 10.86% to 14.30% and in 2010 the range was from 10.59% to 11.90%) and from
10.61% to 13.26% for the remaining companies (in 2011 was from 13.31% to 14.51% and in 2010 was from
11.90% to 15.53%).

The Group used an estimate of constant growth at approximately 1% for the extrapolation of cash flows
beyond the five-year period.

According to the estimates and projections available to management, the expected future cash flows
attributable to the various CGUs or groups of CGUs to which goodwill is assigned indicate that the
carrying amount of all the goodwill recognized at December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 is at least equal to
the corresponding recoverable amounts.

_Sensitivity analysis to changes in key assumptions_

The Company’s management subjects its goodwill valuations to a sensitivity analysis, varying key inputs
such as the discount and terminal growth rates used, to ensure that potential changes in these estimates do
not reduce recoverable amounts to below carrying amounts.

- Although a 50 basis points increase in the discount rate used would reduce value in use, in no case
would this be reduced to below the carrying amount of goodwill.

- Assuming a rate of perpetual growth of 0.5% would similarly result in a decline in value in use, albeit
in no instance to below the carrying amount of goodwill.

**11. Trade and other receivables: (Continued)**

a) Trade receivables:

The amounts and breakdown of ‘‘Trade receivables’’ at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, are as follows:

**2012** **2011** **2010**
**(Thousands of euros)**

823,294 841,106 592,271

As indicated in Note 1, Group sales, as well as trade receivables balances are concentrated across a limited
number of customers due to the nature of the automotive Industry. In general, trade receivable balances
have high credit quality so overdue balances have little significance.

See Note 30 regarding credit risk of accounts receivables where it is explained how the Group values and
manages the quality of credit of accounts receivables.

Impairment provision expense at December 31, 2012 amounts to 1,135 thousand euros (December 31,
2011: 1,633 thousand euros; December 31, 2010: 2,742 thousand euros) (Note 26.c). The impairment
provision in 2011 mainly reflects the integration of the balances of companies from the Gestamp Metal
Forming Subgroup.

The receivable balances transferred by the Group as non-recourse factoring to Spanish, German and
Polish banks, that have been eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements amounted to
119,738 thousand euros at December 31, 2012 (December 31, 2011: 44,841 thousand euros).

In 2010 the risks of the receivable balances subject to factoring had not been totally transferred, thus these
were considered recourse factoring, and were not eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

The expense of transferring receivable balances according to the non-recourse factoring contract,
amounted to 765 thousand euros in 2012, 314 thousand euros in 2011, nil in 2010.

b) Other receivables:

The amounts and breakdown of ‘‘Other receivables’’ at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, are as follows:

**2012** **2011** **2010**
**(Thousands of euros)**

**12. Other current assets:**

This line item, which at December 31, 2012 amounted to 8,731 thousand euros (at December 31, 2011
amounted to 9,172 thousand euros and at December 31, 2010 amounted to 4,229 thousand euros), mainly
reflects insurance premiums, maintenance contracts, and software licenses paid for during the year but for
which the expense will accrue the following year.

**15.1 Legal reserve of the Company**

According to the revised text of the Spanish Corporation Law, companies must transfer 10% of profits for
the year to a legal reserve until this reserve reaches the equivalent of at least 20% of capital.

The legal reserve can be used to increase capital by the amount exceeding 10% of the new capital after the
increase. Otherwise, until the legal reserve exceeds 20% of share capital, it can only be used to offset
losses, provided that sufficient other reserves are not available for this purpose.

**15.2 Unrestricted Company reserves**

The unrestricted reserves correspond to the Group individual financial statements plus its consolidation
adjustments.

**15.3 Availability of reserves at fully consolidated entities**

Reserves held by companies consolidated under the full consolidation method are subject to a number of
restrictions as to their availability depending on whether they are legal reserves, revaluation reserves, or
other special reserves.

The transfers of fully consolidated reserves correspond mainly to the capital increase at Gestamp Holding
Rusia, S.L. not pro rata subscribed by its shareholders.

The increases arise from the capital increase at Todlem, S.L. subscribed by non-controlling interest.

The decreases in 2012 correspond to:

- the reduction of the percentage of non-controlling interests of the group companies Bero Tools, S.L.
and Diede Die Development, S.L. following acquisition of that percentage by the Group in 2012.

- the reduction of non-controlling interest due to the allocation of actuarial losses to the Equity of the
Gestamp Metal Forming Subgroup.

**17. Non-controlling interest (Continued)**

- the addition of non-controlling interest arising from the capital increase (212,000 thousand euros) at
GMF Holding, GmbH (parent company of Gestamp Metal Forming Subgroup) on December 6, 2011.
Via this capital increase, Tocqueville Capital Company B.V. (belonging to Liberty Hampshire
Company, LLC. Group, or ‘‘Liberty’’) which subscribed an amount of 104,000 thousand euros,
acquired a 49.06% shareholding in this company.

According to the agreement between Gestamp Automoci´on Group and Liberty, the former owns a
purchase option exercisable in 2013. The Group has decided to register this addition to capital as a
non-controlling interest in Gestamp Metal Forming Subgroup, given that before any exercise of the
purchase option (if executed); the company GMF Holding GmbH will distribute accumulated reserves
according to the shareholding percentages.

The cost of the purchase option amounted to 1,900 thousand euros and the fair value at December 31,
2011 was the cost value. The fair value at December 31, 2012 is 859 thousand euros.

In addition, a capital increase in Sofedit, S.A.S. on December 28, 2011 by which Le Fonds de
Modernisation des Equipementiers Automobiles (FMEA) acquired a 35% shareholding, resulted noncontrolling interest.

**18. Earnings per share**

Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to equity
holders of the parent company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year.

The Company did not carry out any transactions that would dilute earnings per share in 2012, 2011 and
2010. Therefore, basic and diluted earnings per share amounts are the same.

Non-current provisions will be applied in the long term when the risk that these provisions are covering
will arose or disappear.

_Current provisions_

Additions to current provisions in 2012 correspond principally to the selling risk of Gestamp
Umformtechnik, GmbH.

Applications of current provisions in 2012 correspond mainly to the regularization of provisions related to
resolved litigations. The corresponding amount registered in the consolidated income statement under the
heading ‘‘Consumables’’ is 34,560 thousand euros. Decreases also include the application of short term
employee compensation provision.

Other movements in current and non-current provisions in 2011 and 2012 are mainly related to prior year
adjustments and reclassifications.

All of the current and non-current provisions in 2011 arising from additions to the consolidation scope
correspond to the Gestamp Metal Forming Subgroup (Note 4.2).

Increases to non-current provisions in 2011 correspond mainly to post-retirement benefits (Note 21),
liabilities relating to differences in the interpretation of tax matters, and long term employee
compensation.

Application of current provisions in 2011 mainly corresponds to provisions set aside in earlier periods for
employee compensation obligations of various Group companies.

Non-current provisions in 2010 include those which come from the business combination described in
Note 4.2, in the amount of 89,016 thousand euros, and aim to cover risks from liabilities that may arise
from onerous contracts, accounts payable to employees and liabilities relating to tax assessments.

Current provisions in 2010 aimed to cover risks derived from the estimated impact of price differences on
customer shipments.

Applications of provisions in 2010 correspond mainly to provisions set aside in earlier periods for the
workforce restructuring in the French plants as well as for retirement benefits in the Korean subsidiary.

(a) This accounting hedge is a result of a restructuration of several swap agreements with a fixed notional amount (2013: 100,000;
2014: 100,000 and 2015: 100,000) of which effective date was October 17, 2011.

Under the heading ‘‘Others’’ the Company includes the purchase option of the 60% shareholding of Essa
Palau, S.A. for 3,000 thousand euros which has been fully impaired (Note 8), as well as the present value of
implicit derivatives of exchange rates applicable to sales prices in certain customer contracts.

At December 31, 2012, the Company arranged four accounting hedging strategies:

**Strategy 1:** The first strategy was designed to hedge interest rate risk on loans signed in 2012 by the
Gestamp Metal Forming Subgroup for 50 million sterling pounds, via several interest rate swaps with an
aggregate notional amount of 50 million sterling pounds (62 million euros) at December 31, 2012.

**76,434** **57,389** **33,007**

The heading ‘‘Current tax liabilities’’ of the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects no withholdings and
installment payments on income tax, which are registered in the assets of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Tax expense (tax income) is calculated based on accounting profit, as shown below:

The theoretical tax rate applied is 30% in 2012, 2011 and 2010.

‘‘Differences in prevailing rates’’ in 2012, 2011 and 2010 reflects the differences between prevailing rates in
certain operating markets and the theoretical applicable rate, mainly relating to operations taxed in the US
(40%), Brazil (34%), and Argentina (35%).

The permanent differences in 2012, 2011 and 2010 reflect mainly accelerated depreciation, inflation
adjustments, nondeductible provisions, fiscal transparency, nondeductible differences in exchange rates,
nondeductible expenses, and those differences generated in the consolidation process.

Also, in 2011 ‘‘Other tax adjustments’’ includes adjustments to capitalized tax credits related to differences
in rates.

At December 31, 2012, the conversion to euros of tax loss carried forwards in other currencies, calculated
at the exchange rates prevailing on that date, amounted to 548 million euros (400 million euros in 2011 and
356 million euros in 2010).

At December 31, 2012, the conversion to euros of unused tax credits carried forward in other currencies
calculated at the exchange rates prevailing on that date, amounted to 106 million euros (104 million euros
in 2011 and 128 million euros in 2010).

At year end 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Group had capitalized unused tax losses and tax credits that it expects
to be able to utilize in future periods based on earnings projections and the deadlines and limits for their
utilization.

At December 31, 2012, the Group had capitalized a total of 91 million euros of unused tax losses and
unused tax credits (89 million euros capitalized in 2011 and 92 million euros in 2010) (Note 24.2).

The unused tax losses and unused tax credits at December 31, 2012 whose corresponding tax credit has not
been registered amount to 127 million euros (2011: 87 million euros; 2010: 164 million euros). From that

amount, 72 million euros have limitation period for their utilization between 2013 and 2027 (2011:
57 million euros with limitation period between 2012 and 2026; 2010: 64 million euros with limitation
period between 2011 and 2029) and the rest have no limitation period.

The majority of Group companies are open to inspection of all taxes to which they are liable and for the
full statute of limitations period (4 years from filing date for all Spanish companies except for those with
registered offices in the Basque Country for which the period is three years, and five years, as a rule, for
companies based abroad), or since the date of incorporation, if more recent.

Management of the Group companies and its subsidiaries calculated income tax for 2012 and the years
open for inspection according to the legislation prevailing in each year. Given that the prevailing tax
regulations related to the above mentioned matters are subject to varying interpretations, certain tax
liabilities and contingencies may exist for 2012 and previous years that cannot be objectively quantified.
However, the Group’s directors and their legal and tax advisors consider that any potential tax liability
which might arise would not significantly affect the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements
taken as a whole.

To manage exchange rate risk, the Group uses a series of financial instruments that give it a degree of
flexibility, basically comprised of the following:

A. Foreign currency forward contracts: These arrangements lock in the price at which an entity can buy
or sell a currency on a set date; the timing can be adjusted to align the transactions with the hedged
cash flows.

B. ‘‘Puttable instruments’’: Other derivatives are also used to hedge currency risk, including those
designed to lock in a maximum or minimum exchange rate (collar or tunnel) at a set settlement date.

The tables below show the sensitivity of profit and equity, in thousands of euros, to changes in exchange
rates relative to the euro.

The sensitivity of profit to exchange rate fluctuations, corresponding to years 2012, 2011 and 2010, is as

_Interest rate risk_

The Group’s borrowings mainly bear interest at variable rates, exposing it to risk from fluctuations in
market interest rates, so that market fluctuations affect cash flows. The Group mitigates this risk by using
interest rate derivatives, mainly swaps, by which it converts the floating rate on a loan into a fixed rate. It
may swap the rate on a portion of the loan or on the entire loan, and for its entire duration or a part
thereof.

Virtually all the Group’s borrowings are at floating rates indexed to Euribor.

Had the average interest on euro denominated financial borrowings been 5% higher or lower in 2012, all
other variables remaining constant, the finance cost would have been 1.09 million euros higher or lower.

Had the average interest on euro denominated financial borrowings been 5% higher or lower in 2011, all
other variables remaining constant, the finance cost would have been 0.98 million euros higher or lower.

Had the average interest on euro denominated financial borrowings been 5% higher or lower in 2010, all
other variables remaining constant, the finance cost would have been 0.34 million euros higher or lower.

- Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that a company will not be able to service its commitments as a result of
adverse conditions in the debt and/or equity markets that prevent or hinder its capital raising efforts.

**30. Financial risk management objectives and policies (Continued)**

The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash balances to enable it to negotiate
refinancing on the best possible terms and to cover its near- term cash outlays, thereby avoiding the need
to raise funds on disadvantageous terms.

The breakdown of liquidity and capital resources at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, is as follows:

**2012** **2011** **2010**
**(Thousands of euros)**

403,275 363,020 477,769

- Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or
customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating
activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and
financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.

Credit risk is concentrated primarily in the Group’s accounts receivable. Management considers that its
counterparties are very creditworthy.

Each business unit manages its credit risk according to policies, procedures and controls determined by the
Group regarding credit risk management of customers.

At each closing date, the Group companies analyze on the basis of real historical data the balances of each
major client individually in order to determine the need for provisions or impairment.

The Group has no guarantee on debts and has concluded that the risk concentration is low given that its
customers belong to distinct jurisdictions and operate in highly independent markets.

The credit risk with banks is managed by the treasury department of the Group according to the Group
policies.

The surplus cash investments are contracted only with authorized counterparties and always within the
credit limit assigned for each counterparty.

The limits are established in order to minimize risk concentration, thereby mitigating financial losses in the
event of default by the counterparty.

The maximum exposure of the Group to credit risk at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 amounts to the
carrying values (Note 11), except for financial guarantees and derivative financial instruments.

_Raw Materials Price Risk_

The steel is the main raw material used in the business. In 2012, 65% of the steel was purchased through
programs of re-sale with clients, whereby the manufacturer negotiates the price of steel used by the Group
in the production of automotive components. The negotiated price is directly included in the selling price
customer.

The rest of the purchases of steel were performed through contracts negotiated with suppliers.

Historically, and in accordance with the standards of the automotive industry, the Group has been able to
negotiate with clients, significantly, the transfer of the impact of variations in the price of steel.

**30.2 Hedge accounting**

For the purpose of hedge accounting, the Group classifies its hedges as:

- Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the market value of a recognized asset or
liability, or of a firm commitment attributable to a specific risk.

- Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to fluctuations in cash flows that are either attributable to a
particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction.

- Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation when hedging exposure to variability in exchange
rates relative to a net investment in a foreign operation.

Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at acquisition cost and are subsequently
marked to market. Changes in fair value are normally accounted for in keeping with specific hedge
accounting criteria.

The accounting for these instruments is carried out as follows:

- Fair value hedges: changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item, in both
instances attributable to the risk hedged, are recognized in the consolidated income statement.

- Cash flow hedges: changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument attributable to the risk hedged
are recognized in ‘‘Retained earnings’’ in equity. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the
Consolidated Income Statement when the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss.

- Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation: these hedges are accounted for in a way similar to
cash flow hedges. Fair value gains or losses in these hedging instruments are recognized in
‘‘Translation differences.’’ If a foreign operation is sold, the cumulative value of any such gains or
losses recognized directly in equity (‘‘Retained earnings’’) is transferred to the income statement.

**30.3 Fair value of financial instruments**

The fair value of financial instruments is determined as follows:

- The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organized financial markets is
determined by reference to quoted market prices.

- Where there is no active market, fair value is determined using cash flow analysis discounted at
market discount rates and based on market assumptions at the time of the estimate.

_Non-current financial assets_

There is no difference between the fair value and carrying amount of non-current loans granted since they
all accrue interest at floating rates.

Equity investments are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value when they can be valued
reliably. Since it is usually not possible to measure the fair value of shareholdings in unlisted companies
reliably, these investments are valued at acquisition cost or lower if there is evidence of impairment.

Changes in fair value, net of the related tax effect, are recognized with a charge or credit, as appropriate,
to ‘‘Retained earnings’’ within ‘‘Equity’’ until these investments are sold, at which time the cumulative
amount recognized in equity is recognized in full in the consolidated income statement. If fair value is
lower than acquisition cost, the difference is recognized directly in equity, unless the asset is determined to
be impaired, in which case it is recognized in the consolidated income statement.

_Trade receivables_

For receivables due in less than one year, the Group considers the carrying amount a reasonable
approximation of fair value.

**30. Financial risk management objectives and policies (Continued)**

_Current financial assets_

There is no difference between the fair value and carrying amount of short term loans granted since they
all accrue interest at market rates.

For other current financial assets, as their maturity is near the financial year end, the Group considers their
carrying amounts a reasonable approximation of fair value.

_Interest-bearing loans and borrowings_

For current and non-current bank borrowings there is no difference between fair value and carrying
amount since all these borrowings carry interest at market rates.

_Trade and other payables_

The Group’s management considers the carrying amount of the items recorded in this consolidated
balance sheet line item to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.

_Fair values of financial instruments_

The fair values of current and non-current financial assets and liabilities do not differ significantly from
their respective carrying amounts.

The Group uses the following sequence of three levels, based on the relevance of the variables used, to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments:

- Level 1: Unadjusted quoted price for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

- Level 2: Variables which are observably different from the prices quoted in Level 1, either directly
(price), or indirectly (derived from the price).

- Level 3: Variables which are not based on observable market data (non-observable variables).

The classification of financial assets recognized in the financial statements, by methodology of fair value
measurement, is as follows:

**Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3**

**2012** **2011** **2010** **2012** **2011** **2010** **2012** **2011** **2010**

The classification of financial liabilities at fair value in the financial statements, according to their relevant
valuation methodology, is as follows:

**Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3**
**2012** **2011** **2010** **2012** **2011** **2010** **2012** **2011** **2010**

**30.4 Capital risk management**

The objective of the Group’s capital management is to protect its ability to continue as a going concern,
upholding the commitment to remain solvent and to maximize shareholder value.

The Group monitors its capital structure based on its leverage ratio. It defines leverage as net debt
(current and non-current financial borrowings less short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents)
divided by total equity (consolidated equity plus grants pending release to the income statement).

The Group’s leverage for 2012, 2011 and 2010 is set forth below:

**2012** **2011** **2010**

Non-current debt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 919,521 755,900 684,953
Current debt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 458,623 476,332 455,917
Short term financial investments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (53,397) (35,484) (80,365)
Cash and cash equivalents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (247,566) (260,053) (337,051)

**TOTAL NET DEBT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **1,077,181** **936,695** **723,454**

Grants received . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29,481 30,267 28,709

**TOTAL EQUITY . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **1,579,664** **1,474,179** **1,235,316**

**LEVERAGE RATIO . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **68.2%** **63.5%** **58.6%**

The increase in leverage in 2012, is mainly due to the investments in property, plant and equipment.
(Note 7)

During 2012, the Group maintained its average collection and payment periods, as well as its average
inventory turnover rates, at levels comparable to 2011.

In addition, during 2012 the Group continued to exercise strict control over investments.

The increase in leverage in 2011 is mainly due to the acquisition of new companies: Gestamp Metal
Forming Subgroup, Loire Sociedad An´onima Franco Espa˜nola, and Gestamp South Carolina, LLC.
(Note 4.1); additionally, in 2011 the Group has increased its investments in property, plant and equipment
(Note 7).

During 2011 the Group maintained its average collection and payment periods, as well as its average
inventory turnover rates, at levels comparable to 2010.

In addition, during 2011 the Group continued to exercise strict control over investments.

The financial leverage index in 2010, compared to 2009, remained constant due to the stable average terms
of payment and collection, and the inventories ratios on December 31, 2010 with respect to 2009.

In addition, during 2010 the Group continued to exercise strict control over investments

**31. Environmental issues**

The cost of PP&E items acquired for environmental protection and improvement purposes amounted to
3,335 thousand euros at year end 2012. Accumulated depreciation on these assets stood at 2,277 thousand
euros (2011: 3,115 thousand euros and 2,068 thousand euros, respectively).

In 2012, the Group also recognized 1,100 thousand euros in environmental protection and improvement
expenses (2011: 1,251 thousand euros).

prevent, reduce or repair damages to the environment, and they believe that were such liabilities to exist,
they would not be significant. At year end the Group had not received any subsidies for environmental
issues.

**32. Subsequent events**

On January 4, 2013, the Company signed an investment agreement with Mitsui & Co. Ltd by virtue of
which Mitsui will acquire a 30% non-controlling interest in the Group’s operations in North & South
America. This agreement is subject to obtaining certain regulatory approvals in order to become effective.

This transaction is expected to take place under the following structure: on the one hand, Mitsui will
subscribe to new shares pending issue by Group American subsidiaries equivalent to a 15% stake in these
companies. At the same time, Mitsui will grant a convertible loan to these same Group subsidiaries, which
will automatically convert into shares of these companies once certain pre-agreed conditions have been
met, so that Mitsui would eventually attain 30% ownership of these Group subsidiaries in 2 years.

The total amount of the transaction is 297 million euros: 122 million euros for the initial acquisition of
shares and 175 million euros for the convertible loan.

In addition, in January 2013, Corporaci´on Gestamp S.L sold the Gestamp trade mark for automotive
classes to the Company. The consideration for the sale has been 31 million euros to be paid within a period
of 20 years.

On February 7, 2013 the parent Company signed a loan with EBRD (European Bank of Restructuring and
Development) for 150 million euros with maturity date between 2018 and 2020. On February 7, 2013 the
subsidiary Edscha Holding GmbH signed a loan with Ita´u Bank for 50 million euros with maturity date in
December 2016.
