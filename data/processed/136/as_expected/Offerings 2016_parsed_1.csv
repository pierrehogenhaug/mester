Interest on the notes will be paid semi-annually on and of each year, commencing on, 2016. The notes will mature on, 2023. Prior to, 2019, we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time by paying a ‘‘make whole’’ premium. We may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time on or after, 2019 at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, prior to, 2019, we may redeem at our option up to 40% of aggregate principal amount of notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum, if at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of notes issued under the Indenture remain outstanding after the redemption. We may redeem all of the notes, at any time, at a price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a ‘‘change of control,’’ the Issuer will be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at 101% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any. The notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer secured by a charge over the shares of certain subsidiaries of Gestamp Automoci´on, S.A. (‘‘Gestamp Automoci´on’’) (the ‘‘Collateral’’). See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Security.’’ The notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior debt and senior to any of its existing or future subordinated debt. Gestamp Automoci´on and certain of its subsidiaries (with Gestamp Automoci´on, the ‘‘Guarantors’’) will guarantee the notes (the ‘‘Guarantees’’). Local laws may limit your rights to enforce certain guarantees, and, in addition, your rights with respect to the notes and the Guarantees will be subject to the intercreditor agreement dated May 10, 2013 entered into with, among others, the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the trustee in respect of the 2020 dollar notes (as defined below) and creditors under the Bank of America loan (as defined below) (the ‘‘Intercreditor Agreement’’).

In addition, we have presented certain summary historical financial information for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, which have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Our audited consolidated historical financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 are not included in this offering memorandum. In order to enable investors to compare our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 with our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2013, we have presented in this offering memorandum, as required by IFRS, certain reclassified financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 after giving effect to IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 (as described in more detail below). All financial information presented as of and for years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 has been presented giving effect to the adoption of IFRS 10 and IFRS 11. Other financial data is included which is derived from our accounting records. We prepare our financial statements in euro. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial information in this offering memorandum has been prepared in accordance with IFRS applicable at the relevant date. IFRS differs in certain significant respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the US. See ‘‘Independent Auditors’’ for a description of the independent auditors’ report dated March 22, 2016 on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, which have been audited by Ernst & Young, S.L., independent auditors, as stated in their unqualified reports appearing herein on pages F-1 to F-129 of this offering memorandum. We have presented certain information in this offering memorandum that are non-IFRS measures. As used in this offering memorandum, this information includes ‘‘EBITDA’’, which represents operating profit before amortization, impairment and depreciation. This offering memorandum also contains other measures and ratios such as: EBITDA margin; capital expenditures, net payments on investments, cash, viii ----- cash equivalents and current financial assets; total financial debt; net financial debt; net financial expenses; and leverage and coverage ratios. See ‘‘Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial Data.’’ We present these non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. In particular, we believe that EBITDA is meaningful for investors because it provides an analysis of our operating results, profitability and ability to service debt and because EBITDA is used by our chief operating decision makers to track our business evolution, establish operational and strategic targets and make important business decisions. To facilitate the analysis of our operations, this indicator excludes amortization, impairment and depreciation expenses from operating profit in order to eliminate the impact of general long-term capital investment. Although we are presenting this measure to enhance the understanding of our historical operating performance, EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to operating profit as an indicator of our operating performance, or an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. EBITDA as used in this offering memorandum may not be calculated in the same manner as ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’, which is calculated pursuant to the Indenture governing the notes as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes,’’ or for the purposes of any of our other indebtedness. The information presented by EBITDA, other adjusted financial information and other pro forma financial data presented in this offering memorandum is unaudited and has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other accounting standards. We present these non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. In addition, the presentation of these measures is not intended to and does not comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC; compliance with its requirements would require us to make changes to the presentation of this information. You should not consider EBITDA or any other non-IFRS or financial measures presented herein as alternatives to measures of financial performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, such as net income, as a measure of operating results or cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS. Our computation of EBITDA and other non-IFRS financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Rounding adjustments have been made in calculating some of the financial information included in this offering memorandum. Figures shown as totals in some tables and elsewhere may not be exact arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them. ix ----- _IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements_ We adopted IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 in 2014.

136_1,Offerings 2016.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.1,,"We are one of the world’s largest suppliers of automotive components and assemblies. We design, develop, manufacture and sell highly engineered body and chassis components and mechanisms to original equipment manufacturers (‘‘OEMs’’), primarily for use in the production of light vehicles. We have cultivated strong relationships with our OEM customers by offering them leading technologies through our extensive global footprint of 95 production facilities in 20 countries over four continents as of December 31, 2015. Our technological leadership and extensive geographical and customer footprint allow us to take advantage of global growth opportunities while maintaining a conservative, diversified risk profile. We offer our OEM customers a diverse product portfolio as a Tier 1 supplier of body-in-white (‘‘Body-in-White’’) and chassis (‘‘Chassis’’) structures and complex assemblies, opening systems and mechanisms (‘‘Mechanisms’’), as well as tooling and dies and other related services. - _Body-in-White: Our Body-in-White product portfolio includes large component parts and assemblies, such as hoods, roofs, doors, fenders and other high quality ‘‘Class A’’ surfaces and assemblies, which are used to create the visible exterior skin of an automobile. This product portfolio also includes structural and other crash-relevant products, such as floors, pillars, rails and wheel arches, which together with the exterior skin component parts and assemblies form the essential upper and under body (platform) structures of an automobile. - _Chassis: Our Chassis product portfolio consists of systems, frames and related parts, such as front and rear axles and links, control arms and integrated links, which link the body and the powertrain of an automobile and carry the load of the vehicle. - _Mechanisms: Our Mechanisms product portfolio consists of mechanical components such as hinges for doors, hoods, and trunk lids, door checks and door hinges that enable the user to open and shut the automobile’s hood, side and rear doors and lift-gates, as well as pedal systems and hand brakes. Mechanisms also include powered systems that allow automobile doors to open and close electrically and by remote activation. - _Other products: We design, engineer, manufacture, service and sell dies and tools in support of our customers. We also design, manufacture and sell presses. In 2015, our revenue was A7,034.5 million and our EBITDA was A760.3 million, or approximately 20% and 25% higher than in 2013, respectively. Of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, A5,813.0 million, or approximately 82.6%, was derived from Body-in-White and Chassis and A832.1 million, or approximately 11.8%, was derived from Mechanisms during the same period. We believe that we are one of the two leading suppliers of Body-in-White and Chassis products globally by combined revenue. In Body-in-White products, we believe that we are the clear market leader among individual suppliers in Western and Eastern Europe combined, and in South America. In Chassis products, we believe that we are number two in the market among individual suppliers in Western and Eastern Europe combined, and in South America. In Mechanisms products, we believe that we are the clear market leader in Western and Eastern Europe, and in South America, with estimated regional market shares between 40% and 50% in 2015. Our expertise is in developing and producing light-weight components, which help our customers meet CO2 emissions targets while at the same time enhancing the safety features of their vehicles. We believe we are one of the very few truly global suppliers to OEMs in our product portfolio, with the capacity to meet the same high standards worldwide, either where the same vehicle model is produced in several regions, or 1 ----- where the same vehicle platform is used across different models globally. Our leading technologies, global footprint and proven track record in executing complex projects set us apart from many of our competitors in the industry and have allowed us to secure strong relationships with almost all major global automakers, including Volkswagen AG (‘‘Volkswagen’’), Daimler AG (‘‘Daimler’’), the Renault-Nissan Alliance (‘‘Renault Nissan’’), Ford Motor Company (‘‘Ford’’), Peugeot Citro¨en (‘‘PSA’’), Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (‘‘BMW’’), General Motors Company (‘‘General Motors’’) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (‘‘Fiat Chrysler), each of which accounted for more than 5% of our component sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, our leading technologies have allowed us to rapidly grow our revenue with other OEMs, such as Jaguar Land Rover Limited (‘‘Jaguar Land Rover’’) and Honda Motor Company (‘‘Honda’’). We are committed to maintaining our technological leadership in the development of innovative and high quality products. We are involved in the full cycle of the component supply process, often co-developing parts jointly with our OEM customers and applying computer-aided design and crash test simulations in order to optimize weight and safety features. We design and manufacture components adapted to each new car model or platform and conclude contracts to provide these products throughout the anticipated life of the model or platform (usually between five and ten years). We have been successful in obtaining a high rate of renewal of our programs. Our segment within the automotive components market has been, and continues to be, particularly characterized by the secular trend of OEMs outsourcing an increasing share of a vehicle’s metal components content as they shift more of their capital spending to other areas. This trend impacts our organic investment and sales growth, particularly as OEMs increasingly rely on fewer, larger, well-capitalized and trusted partners. We believe that our strategic, customer-focused geographical expansion and diversified revenue streams, as well as our manufacturing process, design and technological expertise underlie our historical and continuing financial and operational success. We believe that these factors have allowed us to achieve our position as a leading global supplier in the automotive industry, of strategic importance to many of the largest OEMs globally.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341
136_1,Offerings 2016.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Market,9.2.1,,"Structure:_ The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, sells and services motor vehicles which are classified into light vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles. The automotive production value chain is split between OEMs and automotive suppliers like us. The OEM market is concentrated with the 12 largest OEMs by production volume, accounting for more than 80% of global light vehicle production. Automotive suppliers are generally less concentrated and are categorized into three different tiers. Tier 1 suppliers such as ourselves sell products directly to OEMs. Typically these products are large modules or systems which integrate components, sometimes sourced from Tier 2 automotive suppliers. Tier 2 suppliers in turn typically integrate products from a further layer of suppliers referred to as Tier 3 suppliers. Moreover, automotive suppliers may generally be characterized as (i) global or regional; (ii) focused on one OEM group or customer-diversified; or (iii) capable of product development or only able to ‘‘build-to-print’’, i.e., active only in the production segment of the value chain. We are global, customerdiversified and capable of product development. Growth:_ One of the factors influencing our revenue is the growth in vehicle sales and production. Although vehicle production growth rates tend to vary somewhat across geographical regions, global vehicle production as a whole has grown at a CAGR of over 3% over the past 10 years, registering only two year-over-year declines during that period, in 2008 and 2009. Even during the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, some regions proved more resilient than others, while some OEMs faired somewhat better than others. Global automotive suppliers with a diversified customer base, such as ourselves, may thereby experience less volatility in revenue and more stable growth than many of the OEMs. 2 ----- The chart below shows the expected automotive production growth by key geographic region for the period between 2015 and 2020: 120 100 CAGR 15-20E 80 60 40 20 0 2015A 2016E 2017E 2018E 2019E 2020E Western Europe Eastern Europe North America South America Greater China Asia (Ex-Greater China)28APR201614511837RoW _Source: IHS Automotive (April 2016)._ More recently, the automotive industry has recovered strongly from the decline in production and sales as a result of the financial crisis, albeit with regional variations. Global automotive unit production growth increased at a CAGR of 2.9% between 2012 and 2015. This increase has been primarily led by strong growth in Greater China, which increased at a CAGR of 9.1%, as well as a result of the steady momentum in North America and Western Europe, which increased at a CAGR of 4.3% and 4.0%, respectively. Going forward, global auto production growth is expected to sustain a steady increase, at an estimated CAGR of 2.7% in the period between 2015 and 2020. Growth during that period is expected to be led primarily by Greater China, the single-largest market globally, with an estimated increase of 4.3%, while other key geographies of Western Europe, North America and Eastern Europe are expected to grow at an estimated CAGR of 0.7%, 1.6% and 4.4%, respectively. South America and Asia (excluding Greater China), the two regions which recorded declines between 2012 and 2015, are also expected to return to growth, with an estimated CAGR of 1.3% and 2.0%, respectively, between 2015 and 2020. Industry sources forecast that in the period between 2015 and 2020 there will be a higher CAGR with respect to sales in Brazil, Russia, India and China and in other emerging economies than the one experienced in more mature economies, such as those of Western Europe. Notwithstanding the recent declines in the Brazilian and Russian markets, Brazil, Russia, India and Greater China’s combined automobile production is expected to increase at an estimated CAGR of 4.9% in the period between 2015 and 2020, compared to a CAGR of 2.7% in the global market during the same period. Primary drivers of this trend are expected to be rising disposable incomes, along with currently lower car ownership rates. In response to this, OEMs continue to develop their presence in these markets, resulting in an increased need for OEMs to establish supplier networks beyond their home markets. In certain of these markets, such as China, there is already significant demand for new, premium brand vehicle models. Nevertheless, vehicle demand in these emerging economies is predominantly for less advanced models with lower entry-level price points. The evolution of volume demand in these markets is taking place in parallel to an evolution of regulatory and industry standards modeled after those prevalent in mature economies. This trend not only offers automobile suppliers such as ourselves an opportunity to expand our business with our customers in these emerging markets, but it also is an indicator of the high predominance of steel over other more expensive materials, in the production of Body-in-White, Chassis and Mechanisms components in the industry for the foreseeable future. Weight and emissions reduction; Technology; Safety:_ Automobile manufacturers, in order to meet evolving legal, regulatory and industry-standard requirements in the markets in which they operate, are increasingly focused on (i) weight and emissions reduction and (ii) the safety of passengers, other road users and pedestrians. The evolution of the regulatory environment has required automotive suppliers such as 3 ----- ourselves to focus on the design and development of technologies to address the various regulations and to provide differentiated, cost-effective solutions. The focus on weight and emissions reduction has initially been more intense in Western Europe, where standards generally have been more stringent than in other markets, but is increasing in North America and other markets as regulatory and industry standards continue to evolve. The technological expertise in light-weighting and safety which we have developed in the European market is therefore increasingly in demand in other markets. For example, in the EU, automakers face regulatory fines of A95 per every g/km if they do not achieve the CO2 emission targets. The chart below shows the regulatory CO2 fleet emission targets (in gallons per kilometer) by region for the period between 2014 and 2025: (37)% -(45)% (38)% (31)% 169 157 123 125 95 97 68-78 (17)% 136 130 113 2012 2017 2022 28APR201614323311 2014 2020 2014 2021 2025 2014 2020 2025 This regulatory trend has also resulted in our OEM customers increasing their development focus on hybrid or EV as a potentially important means for them to reduce fleet emissions. We believe that EV will also benefit from light-weighting of the vehicle, extending the battery life by reducing power requirements, and that passenger safety will remain a priority among our OEM customers also for their EV. Common platforms and global models:_ OEMs are increasingly designing vehicle models built on common but variable platforms which can be produced in high volumes. The use of common platforms allows OEMs to increase economies of scale across the value chain, differentiate their products from those of their competitors, expand the number of product segments in which they compete, extend the life of existing automobile platforms and remain responsive to changing lifestyle trends and customer tastes. OEMs are also increasingly producing the same models, with minor variations, in different regions. For example, the Mercedes Benz Class C is manufactured in Europe, Asia and North America, while the BMW 3-Series is manufactured in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. This trend towards common platforms and global models provides automotive suppliers such as ourselves increased opportunities to supply larger volumes of products over longer time frames and to benefit from economies of scale. For example, the UKL (LU) platform, which is made for six different automobile models (with their different commercial variants), including BMW 1-Series, BMW 2-Series, BMW X1, Mini Clubman and Mini Countryman, was made by us in 11 different countries and is expected to reach peak annual production of 1.20 million vehicles in 2023. The MQB A0 platform is made for ten different automobile models (with their different commercial variants), including VW Polo, Seat Ibiza and Skoda Rapid and will be made in 13 different countries and is expected to reach peak annual production of 2.74 million vehicles in 2022. The CMP platform is made for ten different automobile models (with their different commercial variants), including Citroen C3 and Peugeot 2008 and 208 and will be made in 13 different countries and is expected to reach peak annual production of 1.20 million vehicles in 2023. The MFA platform is made for ten different automobile models (with their different commercial variants), including Mercedes-Benz Class A, Infiniti Q30 and Mercedes-Benz GLA and will be made in 11 different countries and is expected to reach peak annual production of 1.02 million vehicles in 2022. Consolidation of suppliers:_ In order to take advantage of the operational economies of scale across the value chain, OEMs are increasingly relying on large, technically and financially strong global suppliers, capable of producing consistent and high-quality products across geographies, which in turn promote the consolidation of their supplier base. The OEMs we supply use a number of factors to select their suppliers including, among other things, quality, service (including location, service interruptions and on-time delivery), in-house R&D and technological capabilities, overall track record and quality of relationship with the OEM, production capacity, financial stability and price. In recent years, we have noticed that expertise in product development, an extensive geographical footprint, consistent and high quality production capability and diverse ancillary competencies tend to offset price-sensitivities among OEMs who appreciate the added-value inherent in these other factors. This has led to larger suppliers 4 ----- growing their market share across various segments of the automotive industry which, in turn, increases their leverage with OEMs while also increasing profitability as a result of increased economies of scale. Outsourcing:_ OEMs are increasing their investment in engine-related technology and platform design, leading them to invest less in other important areas such as body and chassis development and production. This trend supports an increase in outsourcing, as the OEMs entrust a select number of strategic supply partners with an increasingly high content of vehicle production. In parallel, specialization has led to advances achieved by suppliers such as ourselves in certain technologies, such as hot stamping, where we are a market leader and which OEMs find difficult to match in-house in price and quality, thereby resulting in increased outsourcing. In addition, as OEMs expand outside of their home markets, they are more inclined to turn to external suppliers for content they have provided in-house in their home markets, in part due to the efficiencies suppliers such as ourselves are able to achieve by serving multiple customers from a single manufacturing facility.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341
136_1,Offerings 2016.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.1,Technological leadership leveraged over a global footprint,"One of the global trends in the automotive industry is the increased focus on innovative and technologically advanced products that seek to address the parallel concerns of improved safety for passengers and road users and weight and emissions reduction. Our R&D capabilities and technological leadership, combined with our global footprint, enable us to capitalize on the OEM customer needs evolving from these regulatory requirements. Our commitment to developing innovative, high quality products has defined our approach to our customers. We are a global leader in the automotive supplier industry in the use of high strength and ultra-high strength steels, which find their application in many body parts of the car where such steel helps to reduce vehicle weight and improve fuel and emissions efficiency, while also improving safety in a cost-effective manner. Many of our products are manufactured using our state-of-the-art technologies in press hardening (also known as hot stamping) and other high strength steel stamping processes. These products, which provide tailored material performance, deformation control and energy absorption potential, offer superior safety and weight reduction, differentiate us from our competitors and help us achieve leading positions in the industry. Although the share of steel products we produce largely reflects the share of steel used by our OEM customers in the vehicles they produce, we also apply aluminum in several of our plants to produce aluminum components for several of our OEM customers, including for BMW in North America, Jaguar Land Rover in the United Kingdom, Audi and other OEMs in Spain, as well as for selected OEMs in Germany. We are a strategic partner for some important premium brands in aluminum chassis development, and we collaborate with them in light-weighting and aluminum technologies. We also use carbon fiber in numerous prototype development projects as part of our work on multi-material solutions for our customers. We are active in R&D with regard to new material applications and joining technologies and believe that we are well positioned as a multi-material solutions provider to employ the best combinations between steel, aluminum and all types of fiber components (or other materials such as carbon) for our OEM customers. Our innovative products and market leading processes are developed through our R&D platform, which has a dedicated team of over 1,300 employees, spread across 12 facilities around the globe, and we are committed to continued investment in R&D. For example, in 2014, we inaugurated a new R&D center in Bielefeld, Germany, focused on our Chassis operations, and we continue to enhance and grow our R&D platforms, where proximity to OEM customer headquarters is improving our market position with OEMs. In North America we will inaugurate a new R&D center at the end of 2016 and in Asia, we will open a new R&D product design center in Japan after the summer in 2016 and in parallel our Body-in-White business unit will start operating from our existing R&D center in China. Selected recent examples of our R&D success include the collaboration of our engineers with Honda in Japan, whereby we were able to provide Honda with key input in the design phase of a number of its vehicle components, demonstrating to its engineers the potential for our tailored material property press hardening technology to reduce weight and increase safety in a cost-effective manner. This co-development work significantly enhanced our relationship with Honda, generating combined product patents that are jointly shared among Gestamp and Honda, the eighth largest OEM by production volume in 2015. This led to new orders at our West Virginia plant in 2014 for components for the new Honda Civic, which launched 5 ----- production in late 2015 and which also led to follow-on nominations in 2015 for components for the Honda CR-V (which is expected to launch by the end of 2016), as well as the Honda Accord (which is expected to launch in the second half of 2017). The Honda Civic, which won the 2016 North American Car of the Year Award, where safety is among the selection criteria, features our soft zone hot stamping technology. We also won the steel award in the area of US winners of the 2016 annual Great Designs in Steel (GDIS) Automotive Excellence Award for advanced high-strength steel innovations. We believe that our technological leadership will allow us to continue to gain share in markets where we remain under-represented (such as North America) and will allow us to further penetrate OEMs that have not historically represented a share of our total revenue in line with their share of global production volumes, such as with Japanese automakers who generally have tended to use their captive or semi-captive supplier networks (‘‘keiretsu’’). Our ability to use technology and our co-development capabilities to win project nominations has particular potential in Body-in-White, as the OEM tendency to co-develop with suppliers in this segment is relatively nascent. Recent developments with other Japanese OEMs in advanced crash system development indicates similar improvement in terms of weight reduction combined with performance increase and cost reduction potential, which leads us to believe in similar future success as has been realized with Honda to date. Our in-house tooling and project management capabilities and our proven track record of successfully managing large, challenging projects, complement our product development and technological expertise and help us win major project awards. We believe we are among the few Tier 1 suppliers that have significant, sophisticated in-house tooling capabilities. These in-house resources give our OEM customers the necessary confidence that we will be able to execute high-content, complex projects on time and according to the required quality standards. For example, for the first vehicle that Audi will produce in North America, we have been entrusted with significant hot stamping of structural parts and assembly content for the Q5 in Puebla, Mexico. We were also entrusted by Volkswagen to manufacture ‘‘Class A’’ surfaces, Body-in-White structural components and Chassis components in Chattanooga for the Cross-Blue, their first midsize SUV to be produced in the North American market, with start of production expected by the end of 2016. In Chassis, we are developing innovative solutions for components, focused on weight reduction, passenger safety and cost savings applying advancements in materials, technologies and processes. Our R&D teams in Chassis are developing hybrid solutions involving steel pressings combined with glass or carbon compounds, and is active with premium OEMs in developing aluminum solutions. Our Chassis business unit is also working on solutions tailored for electric vehicles. In Mechanisms, our R&D teams continue to develop and design innovative hinge systems, driver control and powered systems, focused on weight reduction, ease of use in entering and exiting the vehicle, as well as safety. With regard to weight reduction, our teams have developed hinge systems using aluminum, plastic reinforced with carbon fiber, as well as high strength steel. Products developed by us also protect pedestrians. Our expertise in the development of spindle drives for powered liftgates as well as active/ adaptive door checks enhance the passenger’s experience entering and exiting the vehicle. In addition, the adaptive door check protects the vehicle door from collisions with the environment. We are perceived in Mechanisms as the innovation leader by our customers: We have introduced the first plastic door check (ECC Edscha Corporate Check) in the market, the first spindle drive for automatic liftgates and will next year be the first supplier worldwide who launches a carbon fiber hood hinge in the market. Supporting our innovative products and processes and in-house capabilities is the maintenance of rigorous quality management systems in all of our manufacturing plants and R&D facilities. Through regular internal audits we are able to ensure that our products and processes are monitored to the highest industry standards. We believe that these competencies and capabilities along the entire value chain, together with a high standardization of process equipment and process development, gives us a competitive advantage over many other suppliers. Full standardization, as shown by our own designed and manufactured press hardening equipment, is considered the basis for launching complex technologies with the highest quality requirement in the shortest time, offering as well technological back up strategies to reduce industrial risks.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341
136_1,Offerings 2016.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.2,"Highly diversified revenue base across regions, customers and products","_Diverse regional footprint_ We have a geographically highly diversified global footprint with 95 production facilities in 20 countries over four continents as of December 31, 2015. Our customers often demand just-in-time and 6 ----- just-in-sequence component deliveries. Quality standards for many of the components we produce also require the distance travelled to the OEM to be minimized. These logistical and quality factors generally require that suppliers in our product segments be located close to OEMs’ production facilities. We have continued our successful trend to further diversify geographically, as evidenced by the growth in the share of our total revenues originating in North America and Asia, which amounted to 19% and 14% for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, compared to 14% and 8% for the year ended December 31, 2012. North America is now our third largest market, after Germany and Spain. Our geographic expansion is based on a customer-focused approach. Therefore, while we decide when and where to expand our market presence based on the economic and strategic merits of each particular business opportunity, we tend to expand in regional markets in line with our customers’ strategic needs. Once we have established a strategic supplier relationship with an OEM customer, particularly in locations outside its home market, it becomes difficult for that OEM to switch suppliers and we are well positioned to maintain or increase our business with that OEM. Our extensive geographic footprint also positions us to capitalize on growth in demand for our products from OEMs already established in a regional market (such as North American OEMs in North America or Western European OEMs in Europe), as well as from OEMs growing production outside their home markets (such as Western European OEMs in North America and Asia, or Japanese OEMs outside of Japan). Our strong geographical diversification not only allows us to take advantage of global growth opportunities, it also mitigates the impact of regional demand fluctuations on our business. For example, the recent declines in vehicle production in Russia and Brazil have been more than offset by growth in Asia, North America and Western Europe, while production in Asia and South America during the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 mitigated the concurrent steep drop in vehicle production in North America during the same period. **2007** **2012** **2015** Eastern Europe **(% of revenues[(1)])** Eastern Europe **(% of revenues[(1)])** Eastern Europe **(% of revenues[(1)]) 7% 9% 9% Asia Pacific 0% South America Asia Pacific 12% 8% Asia Pacific 13% North America 10% Western Europe 71% (1) Based on manufacturing origin of sales. _Customer diversification_ North America North America 14% 18% Western Europe 51% 28APR201615485555",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

In Body-in-White products, we believe that we are the clear market leader among individual suppliers in Western and Eastern Europe combined, and in South America. In Chassis products, we believe that we are number two in the market among individual suppliers in Western and Eastern Europe combined, and in South America. In Mechanisms products, we believe that we are the clear market leader in Western and Eastern Europe, and in South America, with estimated regional market shares between 40% and 50% in each region in 2015. In developing and rolling out new models, OEMs are increasingly collaborating with suppliers to design models around common platforms and are seeking to consolidate their supplier-base with an increased focus on large, technically and financially strong global suppliers that are capable of producing consistent and high-quality products at competitive prices. As a result, large, multi-technology, high-quality Tier 1 suppliers such as ourselves are increasingly taking market share from smaller competitors, as we are in a better position to meet these OEM criteria. We have strategic and long-standing relationships with our largest OEM customers, which are based on confidence and an understanding established over many years of successful collaboration. There are very few suppliers that, like us, have such long-standing relationships with the largest global OEMs. There are an even smaller number of suppliers that, like us, are capable of delivering solutions to complex projects, truly globally and on a consistent and high quality basis across the product portfolios. Our scale and ability to develop differentiated solutions for OEMs on a global footing are critical to our success and differentiate us from local and regional suppliers of automotive components. Our highly advanced technological capabilities, global manufacturing and managerial footprint, significant operational scale and track record of financial stability enable us to be one of the few suppliers in our product segment who can support an OEM during the early stages of product development. This ability to 8 ----- support the development process of OEMs and act as an outsourcing partner to them globally is an important differentiator, especially on innovative product solutions, and would take significant investment and many years to attempt to replicate. From operational, technical and logistical perspectives, OEMs often face substantial switching costs in replacing the supplier of a particular component or platform, particularly during the life cycle of a specific vehicle model, and the supplier of a particular car model is also often chosen for subsequent generations of that model. This is largely due to the long lead-time and significant investment required to set up the production and supply processes, and to the efficiencies and savings gained through experience with the manufacturing processes of particular products. Our long-standing and collaborative relationships with OEMs, highly advanced technological capabilities, global manufacturing and managerial footprint, significant operational scale and track record of financial stability provide a competitive advantage over our competitors, entrench our strategic relationships with OEMs and encourage OEMs to entrust us with repeat and new business.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

In our industry, once a project has been nominated to a preferred supplier, it is rare for an OEM to switch to another supplier, given the significant operational, technical and logistical costs of switching, particularly during the life cycle of a specific vehicle model. Given these factors, while the actual revenues which we derive from a project ultimately depend on our OEM customers’ production volumes achieved for the respective car models, we have good visibility into mid-term revenues. Each year, most of our revenues are derived from projects that continue into following years, given that vehicle cycles last several years. Based on current expectations, we believe that approximately 85% of the revenues we expect in the period between December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2018 will be generated by orders already in hand by the end of 2015. In addition, we believe we have a strong track record of winning replacement business, including nominations for content on subsequent cycles of car models for which we already manufacture components. Furthermore, our OEM customers, our brand and model diversification, our highly diversified global footprint and our complementary product lines strongly mitigate the effects of regional demand or individual model volume fluctuations and help to reduce mid-term revenue volatility. We have a highly variable cost base, with limited exposure to raw material price volatility and limited maintenance capital expenditure once a project is ongoing. The primary raw material used in our business is steel, which in the last five years represented approximately 40% of our sales. While steel prices affect our revenue and costs, historically, our profit margins have not been significantly affected by changes in steel prices. Approximately 60% of our steel is typically purchased through OEM re-sale programs, under which an OEM customer negotiates directly with the steel suppliers the price of the steel that we use to manufacture components for that OEM. Such negotiated steel price is passed through to the OEM customer in the sale price of the automotive component. The remainder of our steel purchasing requirements are typically met through contracts with steel suppliers that we negotiate. Historically, we have negotiated with our OEM customers to pass through the increase or decrease in the steel price, eliminating significant volatility in our margins relating to volatility in steel prices. Due to our strong relationships with OEMs and the large steel volumes we acquire in the marketplace, we expect to be able to negotiate competitive steel contracts with suppliers and to pass through cost increases to our customers, thus stabilizing the effect on our results. In addition to our limited exposure to raw material price volatility, we have a low operating leverage, with fixed costs accounting for less than 20% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2015. A significant part of our labor costs, which have represented between approximately 15% and 19% of our total annual sales in the last five years, are semi-variable in nature and can be adjusted to meet business needs. Our conservative risk profile also derives from our areas of product focus. The automotive component segment in which we operate is highly independent of the type of motorization, irrespective of whether the vehicle is gasoline or diesel, internal combustion (‘‘ICE’’) or EV, or hybrid. Therefore, we believe we are less exposed to the evolution of engine technology than other automotive suppliers. Moreover, our expertise in product development and manufacturing processes across a variety of materials reduces the risk of dependence on the success of any one type of material. Although the share of steel we use largely reflects the share of steel used by our OEM customers in the vehicles they produce, we use aluminum in 9 ----- several of our plants to produce components for several of our OEM customers globally. We are a strategic partner for some important premium brands in aluminum chassis development, and we collaborate with them in light-weighting and aluminum technologies.

Our EBITDA between the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2015 increased at a CAGR of 11.8%, while our net debt has remained stable, allowing us to reduce the ratio of net financial debt to EBITDA from approximately 2.5x to 2.0x during the same period.

(‘‘Mitsui’’) through our joint ventures, and has been driven by an increased appreciation among Japanese OEMs of our technological leadership. For example, Honda’s contribution to our North American revenues is expected to increase to 10% in the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2% in the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition to diversification among customer groups, we supply a growing range of vehicle models for each customer. In 2015, we supplied components for 756 models for 16 different OEM groups. Our customer diversification mitigates production volume risk to the extent that some brands perform better than others across different models at different points in time in a particular geography at the expense of their OEM competitors. _Diverse product portfolio_ The general automotive supplier segment of metal components is comprised of a diverse number and type of parts and systems. The fact that we have expertise and an established leading market position not only in Body-in-White, but also in Chassis and Mechanisms, allows us to compete for vehicle content across hundreds of parts and assembled systems. Our diverse product portfolio also supports our strategic relationships with OEMs, who are able to turn to us for innovative, market-leading and comprehensive product solutions across a wide scope of high-value vehicle content.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

We aim to enhance existing technologies, to investigate and develop new processes and, in cooperation with the steel industry, to develop new materials, as well as to apply new combinations of materials to provide our customers with products and solutions, primarily to address weight reduction targets and to provide improved passenger and road user safety at an optimized cost. Our strategy is to leverage our technological competencies in order to win more content with our OEM customers, increasingly by way of co-development with the OEM of components for their new vehicle models.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341
136_1,Offerings 2016.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Strategies,9.5.2,Growth through continued enhancement of strategic relationships with our customers,"We believe that a key to our success is to be strategically close to our OEM customers, with regard to product development and the alignment of our geographical expansion strategies. Providing solutions to our OEM customers has made us increasingly critical to their success. We intend to continue to reinforce this strategy as a means to increase our share of content with the OEMs. 10 ----- _Increase penetration of Asian OEMs_ One of our key focus areas for future growth is in deepening supply relationships with Japanese OEMs outside of Japan. We see a trend of Japanese OEMs shifting more of their production base outside of Japan to be closer to the markets with growing demand for vehicles. In doing so, Japanese OEMs are more open to work with foreign suppliers. We also believe that our technological leadership, particularly with regard to press hardening structural components, offers alternatives to Japanese OEMs that are superior to what is available to them within their traditional supplier networks. Our recent content wins with Honda for our West Virginia plant on the Honda Civic, CR-V and Accord are an example of our successful penetration of Japanese OEMs, with Honda’s contribution to our North American revenues expected to increase to 10% in the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2% in the year ended December 31, 2014. We further believe that our relationship with Mitsui enhances our relationships with Japanese OEMs globally. We also intend to grow with other Asian OEMs where we are underrepresented vis-`a-vis their share of global production. _Increase our share of the North American market_ We are a leader in the North American market in the supply of metal components to German OEMs. Our strategy is to leverage our technological leadership and North American footprint (i) to grow alongside our European OEM customers as they grow in this market and (ii) to more deeply penetrate U.S. and Asian OEMs in the North American market. Emissions standards have traditionally been tighter in Europe than in North America. As targets in the U.S. market have tightened, North American OEM producers are increasingly under pressure to reduce vehicle weight, which increases our potential to win content and market share in this market. _Position ourselves as first-choice supplier for profitable expansion into new markets_ Our deep and long-standing customer relationships give us insight into their evaluation of opportunities in new markets. We study these opportunities in parallel with our OEM customers and often are the supplier of choice to accompany the OEM in a new market. We aim to position ourselves to be able to choose those opportunities which provide profitable growth potential for us.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

We believe that a combination of factors such as our diversified footprint and revenue base, our consistent track record of meeting our customers’ strategic needs in project execution, the maintenance of high quality standards globally, and our conservative financial policies, has demonstrated to our OEM customers that we are a reliable partner and has led to an increase in the content awarded to us by our OEM customers. We will continue to diversify our revenue base, from a geographic, customer and product perspective, as well as our sources of financing, as a means to maintain and enhance our overall conservative risk profile and stability, which we believe gives our OEM customers confidence in us as a strategic supplier over the long term. We aim to build on our proven track record of successfully managing projects which are highly demanding, whether due to scope and size, technological complexity, timing of execution, or geographic location. Our expertise in project management on a global scale, as well as our in-house tooling capabilities, give our OEM customers the necessary confidence that we will be able to successfully execute high-content, complex projects according to the required quality standards. We believe that the maintenance of rigorous quality management systems in all of our manufacturing plants and R&D facilities is critical to our strategy.

While we have executed on a more active acquisition strategy in the past, through our strategic acquisitions of Edscha (2010) and ThyssenKrupp Metal Forming (2011), we are currently more focused on organic growth by participating in the secular trend of OEM outsourcing in our product segments and the consolidation and rationalization of the supplier base in collaboration with OEMs. In addition, since 2012, we have invested in 14 new manufacturing facilities (including both new manufacturing facilities and capacity expansion).",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

Based on our management estimates and information currently available, we estimate that for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016 our revenue will be between approximately A7.0 billion and A7.2 billion and our EBITDA will be between approximately A770 million and A775 million. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2015 our revenue was A6.5 billion and our EBITDA was A684 million. Our results for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2015, benefited from increased sales to customers mainly in Germany, UK, North America and China and were partially offset by a decrease in sales in Brazil, Poland and Russia. The increase in sales is mainly due to the start of new projects related to tangible investments made in previous years. Our EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015, was benefited by our higher sales volume, which has not resulted in corresponding increases in our fixed costs structure, and hence has resulted in a better distribution of our fixed costs within our overall costs structure. We anticipate that our revenues and EBITDA in the three months ended March 31, 2016 are in line with the amounts considered in our budgeting process. This information is based solely on preliminary internal information used by management. Our actual and consolidated financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2016 may differ from our preliminary estimated results and remain subject to our normal end of period closing procedures and review process.

(‘‘Gestamp Toledo’’) will: - rank equally in right of payment with any existing and future debt of Gestamp Automoci´on, Gestamp Servicios and Gestamp Toledo that is not subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee; - be effectively senior in right of payment to any existing and future unsecured debt of Gestamp Automoci´on, Gestamp Servicios and Gestamp Toledo to the extent of the value of the Collateral securing its Guarantee; and 17 ----- - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt of any subsidiaries of Gestamp Automoci´on (other than the Issuer), Gestamp Servicios and Gestamp Toledo that do not guarantee the notes. The Guarantee of each other Subsidiary Guarantor will: - rank equally in right of payment with any existing and future unsecured debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor; - rank equally in right of payment with any existing and future debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee; and - be effectively subordinated to any secured debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’ for a description of certain terms affecting the notes and the Guarantees, including provisions relating to the release of Guarantees and turnover of proceeds following an enforcement event under the Intercreditor Agreement. As of December 31, 2015, after giving pro forma effect to the Refinancing Transactions (i) we would have had outstanding A1,790.0 million of indebtedness, including the notes and the 2020 dollar notes and (ii) the subsidiaries of Gestamp Automoci´on that will not guarantee the notes would have had A239.9 million of debt. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness’’. After giving pro forma effect to the Refinancing Transactions, the Issuer would have had no debt other than the notes and the 2020 dollar notes. The Issuer is a special purpose finance subsidiary and has no assets or operations, other than in connection with the issuance of the 2020 notes and the notes offered hereby. Gestamp Automoci´on is a holding company conducting its operations primarily through its subsidiaries. Intercreditor Agreement . . . . . . . . . .** The notes will be governed by the Intercreditor Agreement, dated May 10, 2013, entered into with, among others, the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the trustee of the 2020 dollar notes and the Bank of America loan. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the notes and the secured Guarantees will share on a _pro rata basis recoveries received upon enforcement over any such share charges constituting Collateral, as well as any Guarantees, with the secured creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Bank of America loan. Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . .** We may redeem all or part of the notes at any time on or after , 2019 at the redemption prices described in ‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption’’. At any time prior to , 2019 we may also redeem all or part of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a ‘‘make whole’’ premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of redemption. 18 ----- At any time prior to, 2019 we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to % of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption date, provided that at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of notes issued under the Indenture remain outstanding after the redemption. Optional Tax Redemption . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer may redeem the notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, if changes in tax laws would require the Issuer to pay additional amounts on the notes. If the Issuer decides to redeem the notes following such a change in tax laws, the Issuer must redeem the notes at a price equal to the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional Tax Redemption’’. Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . .** All payments in respect of the notes or any Guarantee will be made without withholding or deduction on account of taxes unless required by law. If the Issuer or any Guarantor is required by law to withhold or deduct any amount for taxes imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined herein) in respect of payments on the notes or any Guarantee, subject to certain exceptions, we will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received by the beneficial owners of notes after the withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction attributable to the additional amounts) will equal the amounts that would have been received had there been no deduction or withholding. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts’’. Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If we experience specific kinds of changes in control, we may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control’’. Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture governing the notes will, among other things, limit our ability to: - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock; - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions; - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures; - prepay or redeem subordinated debt; - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; - create unrestricted subsidiaries; - enter into arrangements that restrict payments of dividends to us; - sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies; - sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; 19 ----- - issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries; and - create or incur certain liens. These covenants contain important exceptions, limitations and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants’’. Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and will not be so registered. The notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’. Holders of the notes will not have the benefit of any exchange or registration rights. Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We will apply for the notes to be admitted to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for trading on the Euro MTF. There is no assurance that the notes will be listed and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF. No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Although application will be made to admit the notes to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for trading on the Euro MTF in accordance with its rules, the notes will be new securities for which there will be no established market. Although the Initial Purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the notes, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue market-making at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the notes will develop or be maintained. Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We will apply the net proceeds of the offering of the notes, together with cash on balance sheet, (i) to repurchase or redeem the 2020 euro notes and (ii) to pay commissions, fees and expenses (including redemption premia) estimated at approximately A23.0 million in connection with the Refinancing Transactions.

(3) Consists of deferred income and tax liabilities, provisions and other current and non-current liabilities. (4) ‘‘EBITDA’’ represents operating profit before depreciation, amortization and impairment losses. Our management believes that EBITDA is meaningful for investors because it provides an analysis of our operating results, profitability and ability to service debt and because EBITDA is used by our chief operating decision makers to track our business evolution, establish operational and strategic targets and make important business decisions. EBITDA is also a measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry. To facilitate the analysis of our operations, this indicator excludes amortization, impairment and depreciation expenses from operating profit in order to eliminate the impact of general long-term capital investment. Although we are presenting this measure to enhance the understanding of our historical operating performance, EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to operating profit as an indicator of our operating 24 ----- performance, or an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.

The level of demand for our products depends primarily upon the level of consumer demand for new vehicles that are manufactured with our products. The global economic crisis in 2008 and 2009 resulted in delayed and reduced purchases of durable consumer goods, such as automobiles. Although the global economic climate improved slightly between 2010 and 2015, the global economy generally has not recovered to levels previously experienced and remains fragile. In particular, the global economy is impacted by an unpredictable political landscape, decreasing oil prices and strong currency fluctuations. In addition, recent concerns on the economy of emerging markets, particularly China, Russia and Brazil, may have an impact on the global economy. There is no assurance that the global economic climate will continue to improve or that the current levels of growth will remain stable. If the global economy were to take another significant downturn, depending upon its length, duration and severity, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow would again be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

Future developments may continue to be dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the European Central Bank and the European Commission to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe and the continued stability of the Eurozone. Despite our global presence, the Eurozone is a significant market for our business, and adverse economic effects within the Eurozone could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual member states of the Eurozone. These concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the Eurozone and the reintroduction of national currencies in the affected countries. For example, following the Conservative party win in the U.K. General Election on May 7, 2015, the U.K. Government has promised to hold an in-or-out referendum on the U.K.’s membership within the EU. The referendum is expected to take place on June 23, 2016. If the referendum results in a U.K. exit from the EU, a process of negotiation would determine the future terms of the U.K.’s relationship with the EU, which could, in turn, undermine confidence in the overall stability of the European Economic Area. These 26 ----- and other potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could have adverse consequences for us with respect to our outstanding debt obligations that are euro-denominated and, as we have a substantial amount of debt denominated in euro, our financial condition may be materially affected. The financial market disruption that would likely accompany any such redenomination event could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Furthermore, any redenomination event would likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the Eurozone countries, which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our services and, accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows. Moreover, any changes from euro to non-euro currencies within the countries in which we operate may impact our billing and other financial systems. In light of the significant exposure that we have to the euro through our euro-denominated cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination event could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, despite our global presence, Spain is still a significant market for our business, representing 22% of our EBITDA. While Spain’s economy has been gradually improving since 2013, Spain experienced a significant economic downturn between 2008 and 2012. The unemployment rate, while improving in relative terms, was reported to be 20.90% in December 2015 and gross domestic product contracted in 2012 and 2013 before making a modest recovery in 2014 and 2015. In addition, in the recent general elections held on December 20, 2015 no party has obtained an outright majority sufficient to form a stable government. While attempts are being made by the major parties to resolve the situation, if a new government has not been formed by the end of April 2016, new elections will be called by the end of June 2016. This political uncertainty may impact the Spanish economic recovery and affect Spain’s economic growth. Finally, institutions in the European Union are facing significant challenges derived from recent crises in the Middle East, including the Syrian refugee crisis as a result of the Syrian civil war which started in 2011. While several EU member states have made attempts to address the humanitarian crisis, a common approach by all EU member states has not been yet achieved. For example, Austria recently enacted a temporary Schengen suspension, while other member states are threatening to impose similar restrictions in their borders with other European countries. In these circumstances, many of the risks faced by the automotive industry and our business could intensify, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as well as negatively impact our access to, and cost of, capital.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

These fluctuations are caused by such factors as general economic conditions, interest rates, consumer confidence, consumer preferences, patterns of consumer spending, fuel costs and the automobile replacement cycle, and such fluctuations give rise to changes in demand for our products and may have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations. The highly cyclical and fluctuating nature of the automotive industry presents a risk that is outside our control and that cannot be accurately predicted. While we mitigate cyclicality by diversifying our businesses geographically there is no assurance that this will be sufficient. Moreover, a number of factors that we cannot predict can and have impacted cyclicality in the past.

In the year ended December 31, 2015, A4,181.8 million of our revenues (which represented approximately 27 ----- 59.4% of our revenue for that period), on a consolidated basis, were generated in currencies other than the Euro. We are subject to risk if the foreign currency in which our costs are paid appreciates against the currency in which we generate revenues because the appreciation effectively increases our cost in that country. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of some of our operating entities are reported in foreign currencies and then translated into Euros at the applicable foreign exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, appreciation of the Euro against these foreign currencies generally will have a negative impact on our reported revenues and profits while depreciation of the Euro against these foreign currencies will generally have a positive effect on reported revenues and profits. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. Dollar, the pound sterling, the Chinese Yuan, the Russian Ruble, the Brazilian Real, the Argentinian Peso, the Turkish Lira, the Swedish Crown and the Mexican Peso could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition and any sustained change in such relative currency values could adversely impact our competitiveness in certain geographic regions. Economic instability in the countries in which we operate where the Euro is not the local currency and the related decline in the value of the relevant local currency in these countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In jurisdictions where the prevailing currency is subject to significant volatility, we seek to nominate an alternative functional currency in the contracts we enter into, typically either the Euro or U.S. Dollar, to seek to minimize the impact of any exchange rate fluctuations. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we had a negative impact on our balance sheet of A28.0 million as a result of foreign exchange rate translations to our reporting currency.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

The loss of any of these customers or the loss of market share by these customers could have a material adverse impact on us.,"Although we supply our products to several of the leading automobile manufacturers, as is common in our industry we depend on certain large-value customers for a significant proportion of our revenues. For example, during 2015, our top three customers, represented an aggregate of approximately 47.9% of our revenues. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to any of our large-volume customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by reducing cash flows and by limiting our ability to spread our fixed costs over a larger revenue base. We may make fewer sales to these customers for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: - loss of awarded business; - reduced or delayed customer requirements; - OEMs’ insourcing business they have traditionally outsourced to us; - damage to a customer’s reputation; - strikes or other work stoppages affecting production by our customers; - bankruptcy or insolvency of a customer; or - reduced demand for our customers’ products. For example, the reputation of certain OEMs has been substantially damaged as a result of recent ongoing investigations by environmental authorities worldwide (including, _inter alia, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, the European Union and the United States) in relation to the potential manipulation of emission control systems which had been installed by certain OEMs for the purposes of manipulating laboratory emissions testing. Additionally, financial difficulties experienced by any major customer could have a material adverse impact on us if such customer were unable to pay for the products we provide, materially reduced its capital expenditure on, and resulting demand for, new product lines, or we otherwise experienced a loss of, or material reduction in, business from such customer. 28 ----- As a result of such difficulties, we could experience lost revenues, material write-offs of accounts receivable, significant impairment charges or additional restructurings beyond the steps we have taken to date.

Typically the terms and conditions of the agreements with our customers do not include a commitment regarding minimum volumes of purchases from us. In addition, such contracts typically provide that customers have the contractual right to unilaterally terminate our contracts with them with no notice or limited notice. If such contracts are terminated by our customers, our ability to obtain compensation from our customers for such termination is generally limited to the direct out-of-pocket costs that we incurred for raw materials and work-in-progress and in certain instances undepreciated capital expenditures. Further, there is no guarantee that our customers will renew their purchase orders with us.

We have identified certain markets including North America, Asia and Eastern Europe as key markets where we are likely to experience substantial growth, and accordingly have made and/or expect to make certain investments, both directly and through participation in various partnerships and joint ventures to support anticipated growth in those regions. If we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in these regions, we may not only fail to realize expected rates of return on our investments, but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets, potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors.

Our liquidity could also be adversely impacted if our suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require payment in advance or payment on delivery. If our available cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our ongoing cash needs, we would be required to look to our cash balances and availability for borrowings under our credit facilities to satisfy those needs, as well as potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts, if at all. There can be no assurance that we, our customers and our suppliers will continue to have such ability.

Approximately 60% of our steel is typically purchased through OEM re-sale programs, with the remainder of our steel purchasing requirements are typically met through contracts with steel suppliers that we negotiate. An increase or decrease in steel prices affects our results. Although we have sought to be largely neutral with respect to steel pricing’s impact on our margins over time as a result of our steel pricing arrangements, there is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve that goal. Most of our steel purchasing contracts that we negotiate directly with suppliers and that are not under OEM re-sale programs do not have any contractual provisions for pass through of the price of steel to the OEMs. Although historically and consistent with automotive industry standards we have been able to negotiate with our OEM customers to pass through the impact of price swings leaving us protected from changing steel prices, there are no assurances that this will continue in the future. We typically sell scrap steel in secondary markets in which, typically, the price of scrap steel fluctuates in line with fluctuations in steel prices. We generally share our recoveries from sales of scrap steel with our OEM customers either through scrap sharing agreements, in cases where we are on resale programs, or in the product pricing that we negotiate with OEMs regarding increases and decreases in the steel price in cases where we purchase steel directly from the mills. We may be impacted by the fluctuation in scrap steel prices, either positive or negative, in relation to our various customer agreements.

Although the overall number of competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation, we face significant competition within each of our major product areas, including from new competitors entering the markets that we serve and OEMs that may seek to integrate vertically. The principal competitive factors include product quality, ability to manage complex projects, R&D competences, geographical footprint, process technology competences, tooling competences, price, financial stability and partnership in the consolidation and rationalization of the global automotive supply base. We cannot assure you that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business by reducing our ability to increase or maintain sales and profit margins. We principally compete for new business projects at the beginning of the development of new models and upon the redesign of existing models by major OEM customers. In some cases, a number of our major OEM customers manufacture products that we currently produce, thereby eliminating an opportunity for us to bid for the production. New model development generally begins three to five years prior to the marketing of such models to the public. Redesign of existing models begins during the life cycle of a platform, usually at least two to three years before the end of the platform’s life cycle. The failure to obtain new business projects on new models or to retain or increase business projects on redesigned existing models, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

These laws prohibit improper business conduct and restrict us from dealing with certain sanctioned countries. As a result of our international operations, we are exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations applicable in those countries where we operate. Some of the countries in which we operate lack as developed a legal system as other locations and are perceived to have high levels of corruption. Our continued geographical diversification, including in some emerging markets, development of joint venture relationships and our employment of local agents in the countries in which we operate increases the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, sanctions or similar laws. Violations of anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts (and termination of existing contracts) and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. In addition, any major violations could have a significant impact on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business.

In addition, our customers demand that we bear the cost of the repair and replacement of defective products which are either covered under their warranty or are the subject of a recall by them.

Recall costs are costs incurred when government regulators or our customers decide to recall a product due to a known or suspected performance issue and we are required to participate either voluntarily or involuntarily. Currently, under most customer agreements, we only account for existing or probable warranty claims. Under certain complete vehicle engineering and assembly contracts, we record an estimate of future warranty-related costs based on the terms of the specific customer agreements and the specific customer’s warranty experience. Because we have never been the cause of a vehicle recall nor suffered any product recalls or liability damages, we have no warranty and recall data which allows us to establish accurate estimates of, or provisions for, future warranty or recall costs relating to new products, assembly programs or technologies being brought into production.

Once the debtor is declared insolvent, the enforcement of security interests over assets owned by the debtor and used for its professional or business activities (presumably most of the debtor’s assets) is stayed until the first of the following circumstances occurs: (a) approval of a creditors’ composition agreement provided that such composition agreement does not affect such right; or (b) one year has elapsed since the declaration of insolvency without liquidation proceedings being initiated. Enforcement will be stayed even if at the time of declaration of insolvency the notices announcing the public auction have been published. The stay will only be lifted when the court hearing the insolvency proceedings determines that the asset is not considered necessary for the debtor’s professional or business activities. When it comes to determining which assets of the debtor are necessary for its professional or business activities, courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor’s assets. Finally, enforcement of the Collateral will be subject to the provisions of Spanish Procedural Law and Spanish Insolvency Law (where applicable) and this may entail delays in the enforcement. Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected (or registered or other foreign equivalent) and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens on the Collateral securing the notes from time to time owned by us or the Guarantors may not be perfected (or registered or other foreign equivalent), which may result in the loss of the priority, or a defect in the perfection (or registration or other foreign equivalent), of the security interest for the benefit of the Trustee and holders of the notes to which they would have been otherwise entitled. Neither the Security Agent nor the Trustee will be obligated to create or perfect any of the security interests in the Collateral. 40 ----- Spanish law does not contemplate the concept of ‘‘security agent’’. Although this by itself does not prohibit this agent to be set in place, the fact that there is a lack of regulation on the matter provides uncertainty as to how a Spanish court would recognize the acting of the Security Agent in an enforcement situation. Since holders of the notes will not have any independent power to enforce the Collateral securing the notes, except through the Security Agent following the instructions of the Trustee, there is some uncertainty as to whether a Spanish court would recognize the authority of the Security Agent or whether lack of recognition would entail delays in the enforcement or even the consequence of the Collateral not being able to be enforced on the same terms as provided for in the Security Documents.

Upon any such enforcement sale in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, such Guarantor’s Guarantee may also be released. Please see ‘‘Description of the Notes—Release of Note Guarantees’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Security Interests’’. Additionally, the Indenture will permit us to release and retake the security interest granted over the Collateral in order to issue additional notes pursuant to the Indenture. Upon the issuance of additional notes pursuant to the Indenture, there may be a time period imposed by applicable laws between the release and retaking of the security interest during which there is no security interest over the Collateral. In some circumstances, such as if we were to file for bankruptcy after the issuance of additional notes, a hardening period may apply and retroactively void the retaking of the security interest in favor of the holders of the notes. Accordingly, there is a risk that, should we issue additional notes pursuant to the Indenture, the Collateral could be released and its subsequent retaking voided.

As a result, although the Parent Guarantor may have sufficient resources, on a consolidated basis, to make the necessary payments to the Issuer in order for the Issuer to meet its obligations, the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries may not be able to make the necessary transfers to it, and it to the Issuer, to permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the notes or otherwise. In particular, the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries may be restricted from providing funds to it under some circumstances. These circumstances include: - restrictions under the corporate law of the jurisdictions in which the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries are based. The relevant laws could require, among other things, that its subsidiaries retain a certain percentage of annual net income in a legal reserve, that its subsidiaries maintain the share capital of a limited liability company and that, after payment of any dividend, the relevant subsidiary’s shareholders’ equity exceed its share capital. For example, Spanish law limits certain of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries’ ability to provide funds to the Parent Guarantor due to restrictions that require, among other things, each of its Spanish subsidiaries to retain at least 10% of their annual net profit (beneficio neto) income in a legal reserve until the reserve reaches at least 20% of such company’s share capital and that, after payment of any dividend, shareholders’ equity must exceed the company’s share capital. In addition, in order for Spanish companies to distribute dividends available reserves must be equal to, or greater than, the R&D expenses appearing in the balance sheet of the company.

However, the obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited under the Indenture to an amount that has been determined so as to ensure that amounts payable will not result in violations of laws relating to corporate benefit, capitalization, capital preservation (under which, among others, the risks associated with a guarantee or grant of security on account of a parent company’s debt need to be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the Guarantor’s or grantor’s perspective), thin capitalization, corporate purpose, financial assistance or transactions under value, or otherwise cause the Guarantor to be deemed insolvent under applicable law or such Guarantee to be deemed void, unenforceable or ultra vires, or cause the directors of such Guarantor to be held in breach of applicable corporate or commercial law for providing such Guarantee. If these limitations were not observed, the Guarantees and the grant of security interests by the Guarantors could be subject to legal challenge. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantees could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee issued by a company that is not in that company’s corporate interests or the burden of which exceeds the benefit to the company may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that a Guarantor, a creditor of a Guarantor or the insolvency administrator, in the case of an insolvency of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the respective Guarantee and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee should be limited or voided. In the event that any Guarantee is deemed invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent that agreed limitations on the Guarantee apply, the notes would not be guaranteed by such Guarantee.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws varies depending on the law applied. Generally, however, a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if it could not pay its debts as they become due. If a court decided that any Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you would cease to have any claim in respect of the Guarantor of such Guarantee and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and the remaining Guarantors. Please see ‘‘Enforceability of Civil Liabilities’’. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantees, and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds.

(3) Consists of deferred income and tax liabilities, provisions and other current and non-current liabilities. 50 ----- (4) ‘‘EBITDA’’ represents operating profit before depreciation, amortization and impairment losses. Our management believes that EBITDA is meaningful for investors because it provides an analysis of our operating results, profitability and ability to service debt and because EBITDA is used by our chief operating decision makers to track our business evolution, establish operational and strategic targets and make important business decisions. EBITDA is also a measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry. To facilitate the analysis of our operations, this indicator excludes amortization, impairment and depreciation expenses from operating profit in order to eliminate the impact of general long-term capital investment. Although we are presenting this measure to enhance the understanding of our historical operating performance, EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to operating profit as an indicator of our operating performance, or an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.

Once a project is ongoing, maintenance capital expenditure is limited and somewhat predictable. When new programs or vehicle models are required, usually at the end of a vehicle cycle, ‘‘renewal’’ or ‘‘replacement’’ capital expenditure is required in order to adapt existing infrastructure to accommodate new assembly and process design, usually at levels significantly below the expenditure required to create the capacity in the first place. The construction period for new manufacturing facilities (or expansions of existing facilities) typically ranges between 12 months and 15 months and the cash used in investments in property, plant and 52 ----- equipment associated with the construction and equipment of these new manufacturing facilities typically ranges between A40 million and A70 million. Once the construction of a manufacturing facility is completed, the output of the manufacturing facility increases over time, reaching full production capacity typically during the following 18 to 24 months. The table below sets out 14 such new manufacturing facilities and capacity expansion, the cash used in or expected to be used in investments in property, plant and equipment, its construction start date, its construction end date and its expected first year of full production.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

Global vehicle production levels have grown moderately between 2012 and 2015, with substantial growth being registered in North America and Asia, which was partially offset by negative vehicle production levels in South America and, to a lesser extent, Japan and Eastern Europe. While China has moderated its outlook, and Russia and 53 ----- Brazil have experienced weak economic performance, we believe that China, India, the rest of Asia and North America still show strong potential for growth. The growth in vehicle production has resulted in a higher demand for our products and a positive impact on our revenues, while slightly offset by the impact of slower economic growth from Brazil and Russia. Going forward, global auto production growth is expected to sustain a steady increase, at an estimated CAGR of 2.7% in the period between 2015 and 2020. Growth during that period is expected to be led primarily by Greater China, the single-largest market globally, with an estimated increase of 4.3%, while other key geographies of Western Europe, North America and Eastern Europe are expected to grow at an estimated CAGR of 0.7%, 1.6% and 4.4%, respectively. South America and Asia (excluding Greater China), the two regions which recorded declines between 2012 and 2015, are also expected to return to growth, with an estimated CAGR of 1.3% and 2.0%, respectively, between 2015 and 2020. - **_Outsourcing In addition, OEMs are increasing their investment in engine-related technology and platform design, leading them to invest less in other important areas such as body and chassis development and production. This trend supports an increase in outsourcing, as the OEMs entrust a select number of strategic supply partners with an increasingly high content of vehicle production. In parallel, specialization has led to advances achieved by suppliers such as ourselves in certain technologies, such as hot stamping, where we are a market leader and which OEMs find difficult to match in-house in price and quality, thereby resulting in increased outsourcing. In addition, as OEMs grow outside of their home markets, OEMs are more inclined to turn to external suppliers for content they have provided in-house in their home markets. Furthermore, suppliers such as ourselves benefit from economies of scale that our OEM customers find more difficult to achieve in their domestic markets. - **_Diversification Our strong geographic, customer and product diversification has had the effect in the past of reducing revenue volatility during periods of economic downturn. Our well-diversified customer base, which includes all of the 12 largest OEMs by production volume, has limited our exposure to a downturn in the demand for any one OEM’s product portfolio. Regional differences in duration, timing and intensity of economic cycles, combined with the diversity of our geographic footprint, have mitigated the effects of the economic cycle on our business, limiting the impact of our exposure to the cycle in any one region or geography. Our diversified revenue base has allowed us to take advantage of global growth opportunities, even during periods of economic downturn. - **_Steel price A significant part of our cost base consists of purchases of raw materials, which are variable in nature. The primary raw material used in our business is steel, which in the last five years has represented approximately 40% of our sales. While steel prices affect our revenue and costs, historically, our profit margins have not been significantly affected by changes in steel prices. Approximately 60% of our steel is typically purchased through OEM re-sale programs, under which an OEM customer negotiates directly with the steel suppliers the price of the steel that we use to manufacture components for that OEM. Such negotiated steel price is passed through to the OEM customer in the sale price of the automotive component. The remainder of our steel purchasing requirements are typically met through contracts with steel suppliers that we negotiate. Historically, we have negotiated with our OEM customers to pass through the increase or decrease in the steel price, eliminating significant volatility in our margins relating to volatility in steel prices. Due to our strong relationships with OEMs and the large steel volumes we acquire in the marketplace, we expect to be able to negotiate competitive steel contracts from suppliers and to pass through cost increases to our customers, thus stabilizing the effect on our margins. We also sell scrap steel, which is a byproduct of our production process. Typically, the price of scrap steel fluctuates in line with steel prices. We generally share our recoveries from sales of scrap steel with our OEM customers either through scrap sharing agreements, in cases where we are on resale programs, or in the product pricing that we negotiate with OEMs based on increases and decreases in the steel price in cases where we purchase steel directly from the mills. As with input steel prices, we may be impacted by the fluctuation in scrap steel prices, either positive or negative, but historically these fluctuations have had a limited impact on our margins. 54 ----- - **_Labor costs Labor costs have represented in the last five years between approximately 15% and 19% of our total annual sales. A significant part of our labor costs are semi-variable in nature and can be adjusted to meet business needs. The variable nature of our cost-base has assisted our strategic planning and has allowed us to maintain consistent profit margins. - **_Vehicle cycles In our industry, once a project has been nominated to a preferred supplier, it is rare for an OEM to switch to another supplier, given the significant operational, technical and logistical costs of switching, particularly during the life cycle of a specific vehicle model. Vehicle models typically have long, multi-year product life cycles. Given these factors, while the actual revenues which we derive from a project ultimately depend on our OEM customers’ production volumes achieved for the respective car models, we have good visibility on mid-term revenues within a relatively small range of sensitivity. - **_Product pricing During the life cycle of a contract, we are expected to achieve production efficiencies. Typically, in line with industry practice, we pass on a portion of these production efficiencies to our customers by way of price reductions during the term of the contract. When negotiated price reductions are expected to be retroactive, we accrue for such amounts as a reduction of revenues as products are shipped. To the extent we are not able to achieve the efficiencies necessary to offset the price reductions, such price reductions negatively impact our profit margins. - **_Seasonality Our business is seasonal. Our working capital requirements typically increase during the first and second quarters of the year and reduce towards the end of the year. This is due to several factors. OEMs typically slow down vehicle production during certain portions of the year. For instance, our customers in Europe typically slow down vehicle production during the beginning of the second half of the year in July or August as well as towards the end of the year during the holiday season in December during which they also often conduct internal maintenance and adjustments to inventory. Furthermore, there are a fewer number of working days at the end of a year as opposed to the beginning of a year and this results in a reduction in vehicle production at the end of the year. Also, we typically agree final due amounts with our suppliers at the end of the year, which are usually paid at the beginning of the following year, resulting in higher payables at the end of the year and significant cash outflows during January and February. Furthermore, a significant portion of our tooling receivables balances are collected from our clients typically before year-end, resulting in cash inflows and a reduction in receivables at the end of the year. Our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may therefore be impacted by these seasonal practices. However, our strong geographic, customer and product diversification allows us to take advantage of global production cycles and has mitigated the impact of regional demand fluctuations during the year on our business. - **_Foreign exchange transactions and translation We seek to limit our foreign exchange transaction risk by purchasing and manufacturing products in the same country where we sell to our customer. However, the translation of foreign currencies back to the Euro may have a significant impact on our revenues and financial results. Foreign exchange has an unfavorable impact on revenues when the Euro is relatively strong as compared with foreign currencies and a favorable impact on revenues when the Euro is relatively weak as compared with foreign currencies. The functional currency of our foreign operations is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into Euro using the applicable period-end rates of exchange. Results of operations are translated at applicable average rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation gains or losses are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity (deficit). Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in net income (loss).",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

These increases were partly offset by a A101.9 million or 17.9% decrease in revenue in South America associated with lower sales in Brazil and a A0.4 million or 0.1% decrease in revenue in Eastern Europe associated primarily with lower sales in Russia. These lower sales in South America are due to a 20% decrease in the volume of production in our facilities located in such geographical area. Although the increase of the volume of global production in countries in which our manufacturing plants operate amounted to 2.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with the year ended December 31, 2014, the increase of our revenues was higher as a result of the start in production of several new projects in the United States, Mexico, Spain and China.

Personnel Expenses._ Personnel expenses increased by A133.1 million, or 11.8%, to A1,258.0 million in 2015 from A1,124.9 million in 2014. This increase was primarily due to higher sales volume in Western Europe, North America and Asia partially offset by a decrease in Brazil and Russia due to lower sales volume. The increase in volume of production has allowed us to spread our personnel costs over higher revenue, such that the percentage increase in 2015 in personnel expenses is lower than the corresponding increase in revenues.

Our net cash flows used in financing activities were A178.9 million in 2014, primarily due to a reduction of debts as a result of: - the net amortization of other interest bearing loans in the amount of A16.4 million (which include repayments of loans and borrowings of A116.5 million and proceeds from loans and borrowings of A100.1 million); - the net amortization of borrowings from Acek, in the amount of A131.2 million.

Our net cash flows from financing activities were A578.0 million in 2013, primarily due to an increase of debts as a result of: - the issuance of the 2020 notes in the amount of A756.5 million; - the funding of the Senior Facilities of A570.0 million; - the proceeds from the investments by Mitsui of A297 million through the acquisition of a 30% share in our Brazilian, Mexican, Argentinian and North American operations via several capital increases; - the proceeds from the investments by COFIDES of A40.0 million through the acquisition of a 35% share in Gestamp Autocomponents (Shenyang), Co.

(which was owned by Liberty Hampshire Company, LLC group) for A104 million; - the purchase of the 35% minority interest shareholding in our Mexican operations from COFIDES for A67.5 million; and - the payment of A51.0 million in dividends to our shareholders and A4.7 million to shareholders in our subsidiaries. 65 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,341
136_1,Offerings 2016.md,1152,OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS,1152.34,Liquidity,1152.34.1,,"Our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flow, which is analyzed above. Our ability to generate cash from our operations depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in the section entitled _‘‘Risk Factors.’’_ Following the issuance of the notes, our long-term indebtedness will primarily consist of the notes, the Senior Facilities, the Bank of America loan and the 2020 dollar notes. In addition, we have a revolving credit facility in an amount of A280.0 million which currently remains undrawn, as well as A309.6 million in credit lines of which A41.0 million were drawn as of December 31, 2015. These credit lines are generally renewed each year and do not have any security and have customary covenants. Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings and cash on hand, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include: - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of operating profit from our operations, which could be caused by a downturn in our performance or in the industry as a whole; - the failure or delay of our customers to make payments due to us; - a failure to maintain low working capital requirements; and - the need to fund expansion and other development capital expenditures. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under our current or any future credit facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures; - sell our assets; - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of the notes and any future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. In addition, historically we have paid dividends to our shareholders of A51.0 million in 2013 (plus A4.7 million to shareholders in our subsidiaries), A33.9 million in 2014 (plus A7.6 million to shareholders in our subsidiaries) and A37.7 million in 2015 (plus A12.5 million to shareholders in our subsidiaries). We are leveraged and have debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2015 and as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Refinancing Transactions, we would have had approximately A1810.6 million of total financial debt. We anticipate that our leverage will continue for the foreseeable future. Our level of debt may have important negative consequences for you.

We define capital expenditures as consisting primarily of expenditure on property, plant and equipment. This includes expenditure on new manufacturing plants and expansion of existing plant capacity for new production lines, maintenance capital expenditure comprising expenditures on maintenance of machinery and buildings, improvements of existing plants driven by health and safety and noise reduction concerns and replacement capital expenditure incurred when we change the engineering of our production platforms in connection with new models. Replacement capital expenditure is primarily incurred in connection with updating our welding and assembly cells and equipment, given that the most costly categories of our infrastructure, such as land, 67 ----- buildings and press equipment, have long lives and can be adapted with relatively low expenditure for replacement or renewal business. Our estimated capital expenditure budget for 2016 is similar to our capital expenditure in 2015. We expect that our capital expenditure (including both maintenance and replacement capital expenditures and growth capital expenditure) will remain stable as a percentage of sales in the near term. We define net payments on investments as our actual net cash outlays for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, taking into account increases and decreases in payables to our suppliers of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as proceeds from divestments of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

Our trade payables primarily relate to trade payables to our suppliers for raw materials and services, other amounts to the public treasury for taxes and payments to our employees by way of salaries. We have historically funded our working capital requirements through funds generated from our operations, from borrowings under bank facilities and through other sources of financing, such as recourse and non-recourse factoring of our accounts receivable. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Net working capital requirements decreased by A9.7 million in 2015 as compared to a decrease of A151.8 million in 2014. In 2015, working capital requirements decreased primarily as a result of the increase in trade and other payables by A171.1 million, with average days for payment to supplier increasing to 70 days in 2015 from 69 days in 2014, offset with the increase in trade and other receivables by A141.6 million, and this increase is primarily due to a higher volume of work in process of tooling. Net working capital requirements decreased by A151.8 million during 2014, compared to a decrease of A32.1 million during 2013. The decrease in net working capital in 2014 was due to the decrease in trade and other receivables by A84.5 million in part from additional collections on tooling and also from a decrease in the average days for collection from customers to 41 days in 2014 from 42 days in 2013; and also due to an increase in trade and other payables, with average days for payment to suppliers increasing to 69 days in 2014 from 63 days in 2013.

136_1,Offerings 2016.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Introduction,18.1.1,,"The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, sells and services motor vehicles which are classified into light vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles. The light vehicle segment is comprised of passenger cars, vans and light trucks (with gross vehicle weight of less than six tons), while the heavy commercial vehicle segment consists of vehicles with gross vehicle weight greater than six tons. The automotive production value chain is split between OEMs such as Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen and automotive suppliers, such as Bosch, Continental, Denso and Magna International. Automotive suppliers are then typically further categorized into three different tiers. Tier 1 suppliers sell their products directly to OEMs. Typically these products are larger modules or systems which integrate components from Tier 2 automotive suppliers. Tier 2 suppliers in turn typically integrate products from a further layer of suppliers (Tier 3 suppliers). A clear delineation of the suppliers as Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3 is not always possible because suppliers often manufacture and sell numerous products or product groups. Automotive suppliers can also be categorized as captive or independent. Captive suppliers are fully or partially owned by OEMs or serve a single OEM (one example would be the Keiretsu system in Japan). Independent suppliers like Gestamp are not owned by OEMs and can serve multiple OEMs. In addition, some components are sold directly to the independent automotive aftermarket rather than to the OEMs and their captive aftermarket networks. The group of automotive suppliers is typically further divided into sub-segments based on their components’ function within the car. Each of these sub-segments is comprised of various product groups. A typical classification of automotive suppliers by vehicle function could include the following sub-segments: powertrain, body and structural, electronics, interior, transmission, suspension, climate control, wheels & tires, steering, fuel systems, passenger restraints, audio & telematics, exhaust and body glass. There are different market leaders in the respective market niches. Consequently, a consistent definition of these niche markets does not often exist, and it is very difficult to determine the market position of an individual supplier by using objective criteria.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341
136_1,Offerings 2016.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.2,Overview of body and structural market,18.2.1,,"We mainly act as a Tier 1 supplier to OEMs in the body and structural market. The body and structural market in the broader sense is comprised of all the products and components that form the structural elements of the car as well as its outerskin. Body and structural components typically represent a substantial part of the overall vehicle weight. Products that are typically included within this category include among others: bumpers (also including shocks), chassis, cross members, doors (also including frames and panels), fascias, fenders, floors, grilles, handles, hinges, hoods (also including liners, releases and support rods), latches, locking systems, pedal boxes, rails, reflectors, roll bars, roofs, side body panels, skid plates, splash guards, spoilers, subframes, wheel arches and window regulators. Key trends in the body and structural market include the push towards further weight reduction aimed at lowering fuel consumption and, thereby, carbon dioxide emissions. This is being achieved through gradual weight optimization within established component technologies as well as through the development of new, lighter technologies and materials. Examples for new technologies and materials include the use of alternative materials for body components, such as replacing conventional steel components with parts 71 ----- made of high strength steel, aluminum and all types of fiber components (or other materials such as carbon) reinforced plastics. Manufacturing components from lighter materials such as aluminum typically comes with substantial cost increases compared to conventional steel parts, with disproportionate increases in cost for the lightest materials such as carbon fiber, thus limiting the market demand for such parts currently particularly for the production of light vehicles. The chart below shows the weight/cost comparison by material: ### 25 CFRP 20 15 Magnesium 10 UHSS PH Aluminium Steel 5 0 100 75 50 25 |CFRP|Col2|Col3| |---|---|---| |Magnesium UHSS PH Aluminium Steel||| |||| ### Rel. weight of component at same function (%) 2MAY201611280568 The drive towards weight reduction in body and structural components is partially driven by governmental regulation concerning carbon dioxide and emission standards throughout the industrial world, including the European Union, the United States and Japan, as well as by increasing cost and environmental awareness among consumers. The body and structural market is also driven by increasingly stringent safety standards led by both regulations and customer expectations. Together with dedicated passive safety parts such as airbags and seatbelts, body and structural components protect car occupants in the case of a crash and also directly influence the damage inflicted on other parties involved in a collision.

This was primarily due to a market collapse in Russia, one of the region’s largest markets (as of 2015), with production declines of 14.6% and 27.4% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The weakness of the Russian market can be attributed to lower economic growth, decline in oil prices, decline of the rouble, geopolitical uncertainty over the Ukraine crisis, the impact of sanctions and the fact that some major players, such as General Motors, have decided to shut down production facilities in the country. By 2020, light vehicle production in the region is expected to reach 8.3 million units (8.2% of global light vehicle production), implying an expected CAGR of 4.4% between 2015 and 2020, led by strong growth in Russia of 8.7%, albeit from a low starting point in 2015 given recent declines, and increases in other key markets, such as Turkey (an expected growth of 1.0%), slightly offset by declines in markets such as the Czech Republic (an expected decline of 1.0%). In 2016, the market is expected to see a slight decline of 0.1% to remain at 6.7 million units, with a further decline in the Russian market (an expected decline of 10.1%). Key drivers of the market in the medium term are expected to be continued transfer in production capacity from Western to Eastern Europe for cost-effective manufacturing, increasing localization levels to counter foreign exchange volatility and expected demand growth in the region.

The industry’s recovery in the region can be attributed to significant restructuring efforts following the global financial crisis, steady economic growth with higher disposable incomes and rising consumer confidence and lower interest rates leading to greater affordability. Lower oil prices provided an additional tailwind in 2015, lowering the total cost of ownership and boosting demand, especially for the pickup and light truck market segment.

This has been led by Brazil, the single largest market in the region, with declines of 14.1% in 2014 and 21.5% in 2015. The weakness in Brazil can be attributed to weakness in the broader economy, led by falling commodity prices, lower disposable incomes and curtailed state spending on subsidy programs such as Inovar-Auto.

The market witnessed strong growth in 2013 and 2014 of 14.5% and 8.1%, respectively. The growth rate slowed down significantly in 2015 with an increase of 4.5%. This sharp reduction in the growth rate was primarily driven by lower GDP growth, weakness in Chinese equity markets impacting consumer confidence and license plate restrictions being imposed in major cities to curb congestion and pollution levels. Additionally, 2015 saw domestic brands in China gaining market share at the expense of their international counterparts. By 2020, light vehicle production in Greater China is expected to reach 29.6 million units (29.2% of global light vehicle production), leading to an expected CAGR of 4.3% between 2015 and 2020. This implies that China will continue to remain the single largest market globally for automotive production. In 2016, the market is expected to see unit production growth of 5.6%, thus recovering from the low growth in 2015. Principal factors behind the growth are stimulus measures from the Chinese government (reduction in the sales tax rate from 10% to 5% on small cars with engine capacity of less than 1.6 litres), a lower base of comparison for growth given 2015 declines, a strong model launch pipeline and normalized inventory levels following the significant destocking witnessed in the third quarter of 2015.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

However, this overall decline masks significant differences at the country level, with growth in India, Indonesia and Thailand being offset by declines in larger, more mature markets in Japan and South Korea. Weakness in Japan and South Korea is mainly due to slower economic growth, saturation in car ownership levels, higher wage levels and an aging demographic relative to other markets. These factors have led carmakers and suppliers to shift their attention to more buoyant emerging markets such as India and Indonesia.

Consolidation is expected to continue driven by cooperation amongst OEMs, strengthened common platform strategies (utilization of the same 74 ----- core car design platform for various distinct models) and the restructuring and insolvency of midsize suppliers. Consequently, a number of larger suppliers are evolving who are able to produce large volumes, are financially sound and have a broad product offering. This new generation of automotive suppliers is expected to have a closer relationship with OEMs and have stronger bargaining power than their midsize competitors. The increased specialization and ‘‘modularization’’ (production of components with standardized product features, which can be used for a wider range of vehicles) will enable suppliers to manufacture larger volumes of certain products. OEMs are developing a collaborative relationship with their suppliers, which has allowed them to optimize the value chain and better positions them for structural challenges in the automotive industry. For suppliers, this collaboration is important as it allows them to avoid redundant investments and reduce their product development costs.

It is driven by consumers’ preference to save money on fuel and regulatory factors. Furthermore, increasing social and environmental awareness among end consumers is expected to play a greater role in vehicle purchase decisions. Consequently, OEMs face on-going pressure to improve the fuel efficiency of their vehicles and thereby reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The regulatory obligation to improve the efficiency of existing technologies and to develop new environmentally-friendly technologies, aimed at reducing fuel consumption and a consequent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, is becoming a key focus for OEMs given stringent carbon dioxide consumption and emission standards throughout the industrial world, including the European Union, the United States, China and Japan. For example, to avoid the imposition of penalty payments EU car manufacturers’ fleet average for passenger cars must comply with carbon dioxide emission limits of 130 g/km by 2015, and this target is proposed to reduce to around 95g/km by 2020. Another key trend is the increasing discussion concerning a possible shift toward real-world testing measures and away from laboratory-based measurement of emission levels.

Many countries have adopted emission regulations which set limits on the amount of pollutants that new vehicles can emit. These regulations limit, in particular, the emission of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and particulate matter, all of which are considered harmful to human health. Within the next several years emission limits worldwide are expected to become increasingly restrictive given growing environmental awareness. Regulations have been adopted in both developed and emerging markets; Brazil, India and China, for example, tend to adopt similar regulations a few years after they have been approved in Europe. The emission limits for nitrogen oxides and particulate matters emitted by diesel vehicles are expected to face most substantial 75 ----- reductions. The currently applicable emissions standard in Europe, called Euro 6, for example, limits NOx emissions at 0.08 g/km compared to 0.18 g/km under Euro 5. These emission levels are viewed as particularly challenging for diesel engines, which operate under ‘‘lean burning’’ conditions. Recent scandals involving emissions testing have further enhanced the focus on fuel efficiency norms and their implementation.

Additionally, regulators have set stringent regulation targets that require a certain degree of engine electrification. This is leading to an increase in demand for both hybrid and electric vehicles, with hybrids being considerably more in demand given the flexibility they afford in terms of switching seamlessly between electric and traditional diesel or gasoline technology. Given considerable headwinds to full electrification such as higher cost, short driving range and lack of charging infrastructure, hybrids are expected to gain a majority of the market share being ceded by traditional technologies. This shift is creating significant opportunities, primarily for suppliers focused on transmissions and powertrains with respect to areas like hybrid transmission systems, 48V ‘‘mild’’ hybrid technology as well as high-voltage systems along with modifications like engine downsizing and turbocharging being made to traditional systems.

We have cultivated strong relationships with our OEM customers by offering them leading technologies through our extensive global footprint of 95 production facilities in 20 countries over four continents as of December 31, 2015. Our technological leadership and extensive geographical and customer footprint allow us to take advantage of global growth opportunities while maintaining a conservative, diversified risk profile. We offer our OEM customers a diverse product portfolio as a Tier 1 supplier of Body-in-White and Chassis structures and complex assemblies, opening systems and Mechanisms, as well as tooling and dies and other related services. - _Body-in-White: Our Body-in-White product portfolio includes large component parts and assemblies, such as hoods, roofs, doors, fenders and other high quality ‘‘Class A’’ surfaces and assemblies, which are used to create the visible exterior skin of an automobile. This product portfolio also includes structural and other crash-relevant products, such as floors, pillars, rails and wheel arches, which together with the exterior skin component parts and assemblies form the essential upper and under body (platform) structures of an automobile. - _Chassis: Our Chassis product portfolio consists of systems, frames and related parts, such as front and rear axles and links, control arms and integrated links, which link the body and the powertrain of an automobile and carry the load of the vehicle. - _Mechanisms: Our Mechanisms product portfolio consists of mechanical components such as hinges for doors, hoods, and trunk lids, door checks and door hinges that enable the user to open and shut the automobile’s hood, side and rear doors and lift-gates, as well as pedal systems and hand brakes. Mechanisms also include powered systems that allow automobile doors to open and close electrically and by remote activation. - _Other products: We design, engineer, manufacture, service and sell dies and tools in support of our customers. We also design, manufacture and sell presses. In 2015, our revenue was A7,034.5 million and our EBITDA was A760.3 million, or approximately 20% and 25% higher than in 2013, respectively. Of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, A5,813.0 million, or approximately 82.6%, was derived from Body-in-White and Chassis and A832.1 million, or approximately 11.8%, was derived from Mechanisms during the same period. We believe that we are one of the two leading suppliers of Body-in-White and Chassis products globally by combined revenue. In Body-in-White products, we believe that we are the clear market leader among individual suppliers in Western and Eastern Europe combined, and in South America. In Chassis products, we believe that we are number two in the market among individual suppliers in Western and Eastern Europe combined, and in South America. In Mechanisms products, we believe that we are the clear market leader in Western and Eastern Europe, and in South America, with estimated regional market shares between 40% and 50% in 2015. Our expertise is in developing and producing light-weight components, which help our customers meet CO2 emissions targets while at the same time enhancing the safety features of their vehicles. We believe we are one of the very few truly global suppliers to OEMs in our product portfolio, with the capacity to meet the same high standards worldwide, either where the same vehicle model is produced in several regions, or where the same vehicle platform is used across different models globally. Our leading technologies, global footprint and proven track record in executing complex projects set us apart from many of our competitors in the industry and have allowed us to secure strong relationships with almost all major global automakers, including Volkswagen, Daimler, Renault-Nissan, Ford, PSA, BMW, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler, each of which accounted for more than 5% of our component sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, our leading technologies have allowed us to rapidly grow our revenue with other OEMs, such as Jaguar Land Rover and Honda. We are committed to maintaining our technological leadership in the development of innovative and high quality products. We are involved in the full cycle of the component supply process, often co-developing parts jointly with our OEM customers and applying computer-aided design and crash test simulations in 78 ----- order to optimize weight and safety features. We design and manufacture components adapted to each new car model or platform and conclude contracts to provide these products throughout the anticipated life of the model or platform (usually between five and ten years). We have been successful in obtaining a high rate of renewal of our programs. Our segment within the automotive components market has been, and continues to be, particularly characterized by the secular trend of OEMs outsourcing an increasing share of a vehicle’s metal components content as they shift more of their capital spending to other areas. This trend impacts our organic investment and sales growth, particularly as OEMs increasingly rely on fewer, larger, well-capitalized and trusted partners. We believe that our strategic, customer-focused geographical expansion and diversified revenue streams, as well as our manufacturing, process, design and technological expertise underlie our historical and continuing financial and operational success.

Our R&D capabilities and technological leadership, combined with our global footprint, enable us to capitalize on the OEM customer needs evolving from these regulatory requirements. Our commitment to developing innovative, high quality products has defined our approach to our customers. We are a global leader in the automotive supplier industry in the use of high strength and ultra-high strength steels, which find their application in many body parts of the car where such steel helps to reduce vehicle weight and improve fuel and emissions efficiency, while also improving safety in a cost-effective manner. Many of our products are manufactured using our state-of-the-art technologies in press hardening (also known as hot stamping) and other high strength steel stamping processes. These products, which provide tailored material performance, deformation control and energy absorption potential, offer superior safety and weight reduction, differentiate us from our competitors and help us achieve leading positions in the industry. Although the share of steel products we produce largely reflects the share of steel used by our OEM customers in the vehicles they produce, we also apply aluminum in several of our plants to produce aluminum components for several of our OEM customers, including for BMW in North America, Jaguar Land Rover in the United Kingdom, Audi and other OEMs in Spain, as well as for selected OEMs in Germany. We are a strategic partner for some important premium brands in aluminum chassis development, and we collaborate with them in light-weighting and aluminum technologies. We also use carbon fiber in numerous prototype development projects as part of our work on multi-material solutions for our customers. We are active in R&D with regard to new material applications and joining technologies and believe that we are well positioned as a multi-material solutions provider to employ the best combinations between steel, aluminum and all types of fiber components (or other materials such as carbon) for our OEM customers. Our innovative products and market leading processes are developed through our R&D platform, which has a dedicated team of over 1,300 employees, spread across 12 facilities around the globe, and we are committed to continued investment in R&D. For example, in 2014, we inaugurated a new R&D center in Bielefeld, Germany, focused on our Chassis operations, and we continue to enhance and grow our R&D platforms, particularly in North America and Asia where proximity to OEM customer headquarters is improving our market position with OEMs in Asia and North America. In North America we will inaugurate a new R&D center at the end of 2016 and in Asia, we will open a new R&D product design center in Japan after the summer in 2016 and in parallel our Body-in-White business unit will start operating from our existing R&D center in China. Selected recent examples of our R&D success include the collaboration of our engineers with Honda in Japan, whereby we were able to provide Honda with key input in the design phase of a number of its vehicle components, demonstrating to its engineers the potential for our tailored material property press hardening technology to reduce weight and increase safety in a cost-effective manner. This co-development 79 ----- work significantly enhanced our relationship with Honda, generating combined product patents that are jointly shared among Gestamp and Honda, the eighth largest OEM by production volume in 2015. This led to new orders at our West Virginia plant in 2014 for components for the new Honda Civic, which launched production in late 2015 and which also led to follow-on nominations in 2015 for components for the Honda CR-V (which is expected to launch by the end of 2016), as well as the Honda Accord (which is expected to launch in the second half of 2017). The Honda Civic, which won the 2016 North American Car of the Year Award, where safety is among the selection criteria, features our soft zone hot stamping technology. We also won the steel award in the area of US winners of the 2016 annual Great Designs in Steel (GDIS) Automotive Excellence Award for advanced high-strength steel innovations. We believe that our technological leadership will allow us to continue to gain share in markets where we remain under-represented (such as North America) and will allow us to further penetrate OEMs that have not historically represented a share of our total revenue in line with their share of global production volumes, such as with Japanese automakers who generally have tended to use their captive or semi-captive supplier networks (‘‘keiretsu’’). Our ability to use technology and our co-development capabilities to win project nominations has particular potential in Body-in-White, as the OEM tendency to co-develop with suppliers in this segment is relatively nascent. Recent developments with other Japanese OEMs in advanced crash system development indicates similar improvement in terms of weight reduction combined with performance increase and cost reduction potential, which leads us to believe in similar future success as has been realized with Honda to date. Our in-house tooling and project management capabilities and our proven track record of successfully managing large, challenging projects, complement our product development and technological expertise and help us win major project awards. We believe we are among the few Tier 1 suppliers that have significant, sophisticated in-house tooling capabilities. These in-house resources give our OEM customers the necessary confidence that we will be able to execute high-content, complex projects on time and according to the required quality standards. For example, for the first vehicle that Audi will produce in North America, we have been entrusted with significant hot stamping of structural parts and assembly content for the Q5 in Puebla, Mexico. We were also entrusted by Volkswagen to manufacture ‘‘Class A’’ surfaces, Body-in-White structural components and Chassis components in Chattanooga for the Cross-Blue, their first midsize SUV to be produced in the North American market, with start of production expected by the end of 2016. In Chassis, we are developing innovative solutions for components, focused on weight reduction, passenger safety and cost savings applying advancements in materials, technologies and processes. Our R&D teams in Chassis are developing hybrid solutions involving steel pressings combined with glass or carbon compounds, and is active with premium OEMs in developing aluminum solutions. Our Chassis business unit is also working on solutions tailored for electric vehicles. In Mechanisms, our R&D teams continue to develop and design innovative hinge systems, driver control and powered systems, focused on weight reduction, ease of use in entering and exiting the vehicle, as well as safety. With regard to weight reduction, our teams have developed hinge systems using aluminum, plastic reinforced with carbon fiber, as well as high strength steel. Products developed by us also protect pedestrians. Our expertise in the development of spindle drives for powered liftgates as well as active/ adaptive door checks enhance the passenger’s experience entering and exiting the vehicle. In addition, the adaptive door check protects the vehicle door from collisions with the environment. We are perceived in Mechanisms as the innovation leader by our customers: We have introduced the first plastic door check (ECC Edscha Corporate Check) in the market, the first spindle drive for automatic liftgates and will next year be the first supplier worldwide who launches a carbon fiber hood hinge in the market. Supporting our innovative products and processes and in-house capabilities is the maintenance of rigorous quality management systems in all of our manufacturing plants and R&D facilities. Through regular internal audits we are able to ensure that our products and processes are monitored to the highest industry standards. We believe that these competencies and capabilities along the entire value chain, together with a high standardization of process equipment and process development, gives us a competitive advantage over many other suppliers. Full standardization, as shown by our own designed and manufactured press hardening equipment, is considered the basis for launching complex technologies with the highest quality requirement in the shortest time, offering as well technological back up strategies to reduce industrial risks. 80 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

Our customers often demand just-in-time and just-in-sequence component deliveries. Quality standards for many of the components we produce also require the distance travelled to the OEM to be minimized. These logistical and quality factors generally require that suppliers in our product segments be located close to OEMs’ production facilities. We have continued our successful trend to further diversify geographically, as evidenced by the growth in the share of our total revenues originating in North America and Asia, which amounted to 19% and 14% for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, compared to 14% and 8% for the year ended December 31, 2012. North America is now our third largest market, after Germany and Spain. Our geographic expansion is based on a customer-focused approach. Therefore, while we decide when and where to expand our market presence based on the economic and strategic merits of each particular business opportunity, we tend to expand in regional markets in line with our customers’ strategic needs. Once we have established a strategic supplier relationship with an OEM customer, particularly in locations outside its home market, it becomes difficult for that OEM to switch suppliers and we are well positioned to maintain or increase our business with that OEM. Our extensive geographic footprint also positions us to capitalize on growth in demand for our products from OEMs already established in a regional market (such as North American OEMs in North America or Western European OEMs in Europe), as well as from OEMs growing production outside their home markets (such as Western European OEMs in North America and Asia, or Japanese OEMs outside of Japan). Our strong geographical diversification not only allows us to take advantage of global growth opportunities, it also mitigates the impact of regional demand fluctuations on our business.

In our industry, once a project has been nominated to a preferred supplier, it is rare for an OEM to switch to another supplier, given the significant operational, technical and logistical costs of switching, particularly during the life cycle of a specific vehicle model. Given these factors, while the actual revenues which we derive from a project ultimately depend on our OEM customers’ production volumes achieved for the respective car models, we have good visibility into mid-term revenues. Each year, most of our revenues are derived from projects that continue into following years, given that vehicle cycles last several years.

We have a highly variable cost base, with limited exposure to raw material price volatility and limited maintenance capital expenditure once a project is ongoing. The primary raw material used in our business is steel, which in the last five years represented approximately 40% of our sales. While steel prices affect our revenue and costs, historically, our profit margins have not been significantly affected by changes in steel prices. Approximately 60% of our steel is typically purchased through OEM re-sale programs, under which an OEM customer negotiates directly with the steel suppliers the price of the steel that we use to manufacture components for that OEM. Such negotiated steel price is passed through to the OEM customer in the sale price of the automotive component. The remainder of our steel purchasing 83 ----- requirements are typically met through contracts with steel suppliers that we negotiate. Historically, we have negotiated with our OEM customers to pass through the increase or decrease in the steel price, eliminating significant volatility in our margins relating to volatility in steel prices. Due to our strong relationships with OEMs and the large steel volumes we acquire in the marketplace, we expect to be able to negotiate competitive steel contracts with suppliers and to pass through cost increases to our customers, thus stabilizing the effect on our results. In addition to our limited exposure to raw material price volatility, we have a low operating leverage, with fixed costs accounting for less than 20% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2015. A significant part of our labor costs, which have represented between approximately 15% and 19% of our total annual sales in the last five years, are semi-variable in nature and can be adjusted to meet business needs. Our conservative risk profile also derives from our areas of product focus. The automotive component segment in which we operate is highly independent of the type of motorization, irrespective of whether the vehicle is gasoline or diesel, ICE or EV, or hybrid. Therefore, we believe we are less exposed to the evolution of engine technology than other automotive suppliers. Moreover, our expertise in product development and manufacturing processes across a variety of materials reduces the risk of dependence on the success of any one type of material. Although the share of steel we use largely reflects the share of steel used by our OEM customers in the vehicles they produce, we use aluminum in several of our plants to produce components for several of our OEM customers globally. We are a strategic partner for some important premium brands in aluminum chassis development, and we collaborate with them in lightweighting and aluminum technologies. We also use carbon fiber in numerous prototype development projects as part of our work on multi-material solutions for our customers. We are active in R&D with regard to new material applications and joining technologies and believe that we are well positioned as a multi-material solutions provider to employ the best combinations of steel, aluminum and all types of fiber components (or other materials such as carbon) for our OEM customers. Our conservative risk profile also extends to our financial condition. We have been able to maintain and improve conservative leverage ratios despite investing over A1 billion between 2013 and 2015, largely for growth projects whose full production is not yet reflected in our results of operations. Our EBITDA between the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2015 increased at a CAGR of 11.8%, while our net debt has remained stable, allowing us to reduce the ratio of net financial debt to EBITDA from approximately 2.5x to 2.0x during the same period. Our highly variable cost-base, conservative risk profile and low operating leverage reduce the exposure of our operations to unpredictable externalities and constitute an important strength of ours.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

In the year ended December 31, 2015, our top three OEM customers accounted for 47.9% of our sales to OEMs (excluding tooling), compared to 60.3% in the year ended December 31, 2007. We continue to pursue a strategy of customer diversification and are increasing our penetration of OEMs such as Jaguar Land Rover, Honda, Toyota and others. Our dialogue with Japanese OEMs has been supported by our relationship with Mitsui through our joint ventures, and has been driven by an increased appreciation among Japanese OEMs of our technological leadership. For example, Honda’s contribution to our North American revenues is expected to increase to 10% in the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2% in the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition to diversification among customer groups, we supply a growing range of vehicle models for each customer. In 2015, we supplied components for 756 models for 16 different OEM groups. Our customer diversification mitigates production volume risk to the extent that some brands perform better than others across different models at different points in time in a particular geography at the expense of their OEM competitors. _Diverse product portfolio_ The general automotive supplier segment of metal components is comprised of a diverse number and type of parts and systems. The fact that we have expertise and an established leading market position not only in Body-in-White, but also in Chassis and Mechanisms, allows us to compete for vehicle content across hundreds of parts and assembled systems.

Providing solutions to our OEM customers has made us increasingly critical to their success. We intend to continue to reinforce this strategy as a means to increase our share of content with the OEMs. _Increase penetration of Asian OEMs_ One of our key focus areas for future growth is in deepening supply relationships with Japanese OEMs outside of Japan. We see a trend of Japanese OEMs shifting more of their production base outside of Japan to be closer to the markets with growing demand for vehicles. In doing so, Japanese OEMs are more open to work with foreign suppliers. We also believe that our technological leadership, particularly with regard to press hardening structural components, offers alternatives to Japanese OEMs that are superior to what is available to them within their traditional supplier networks. Our recent content wins with Honda for our West Virginia plant on the Honda Civic, CR-V and Accord are an example of our successful penetration of Japanese OEMs, with Honda’s contribution to our North American revenues expected to increase to 10% in the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2% in the year ended December 31, 2014. We further believe that our relationship with Mitsui enhances our relationships with Japanese OEMs globally. We also intend to grow with other Asian OEMs where we are underrepresented vis-`a-vis their share of global production. _Increase our share of the North American market_ We are a leader in the North American market in the supply of metal components to German OEMs. Our strategy is to leverage our technological leadership and North American footprint (i) to grow alongside our European OEM customers as they grow in this market and (ii) to more deeply penetrate U.S. and Asian OEMs in the North American market. Emissions standards have traditionally been tighter in Europe than in North America. As targets in the U.S. market have tightened, North American OEM producers are increasingly under pressure to reduce vehicle weight, which increases our potential to win content and market share in this market. _Position ourselves as first-choice supplier for profitable expansion into new markets_ Our deep and long-standing customer relationships give us insight into their evaluation of opportunities in new markets.

136_1,Offerings 2016.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.15,Manufacturing processes,18.15.1,,"Since our foundation in 1997 we, and the technologies employed in our manufacturing processes, have evolved significantly from a limited-technology company based only on cold stamping, to a multitechnology company with diversified technological capabilities. We now have a broad technology portfolio and capabilities across the value chain, including (i) in-house die/tool manufacturing capabilities; (ii) a wide range of forming technologies from press hardening to cold forming technologies such as roll-forming and hydro-forming, in addition to the full range of cold stamping processes; (iii) advanced assembly technologies such as remote laser welding; and (iv) finishing technologies such as powder coating and cataphoretic painting. _Die or tool manufacturing_ Dies or tools are the common terms for the equipment used in the stamping and forming processes to cut or form raw material into a required shape using a press. Our in-house tooling capabilities cover the entire tooling value chain from the initial process of die design to the secondary phase of prototyping, patterning, casting, machining and setting the die through to try-out verification, quality checks and logistics. We are recognized as one of the few suppliers that have in-house tooling capabilities that can address the manufacture of parts that comprise the visible outer skin of the car (also called Class A parts) such as doors and hoods. Critical phases such as follow-ups and quality checks are carried out globally by dedicated teams. We have a supplier development program in place to assure the quality of any outsourced tooling. Our customers recognize us as one of the few suppliers that have the internal capacities for developing and manufacturing tooling for press hardening. _Forming_ Press Hardening or Hot Stamping Press hardening is an innovative process by which advanced ultra-high strength steel is formed into complex shapes more efficiently than with traditional cold stamping. The process involves the heating of the steel blanks until they are malleable, followed by formation and then rapid cooling in specially designed dies, creating in the process a transformed and hardened material. Because of this ability to efficiently combine strength and complexity, press hardened parts accomplish in one relatively light-weight 88 ----- piece what would typically require thicker, heavier parts welded together in more than one process under cold stamping. Press hardening parts therefore currently represent one of the most advanced lightweight solutions for the car body structure that simultaneously allows us to improve crash performance and the fulfillment of passenger safety requirements. Set out below is a graphic description of the basic process of press hardening. 26APR201620035585 The press hardening process is comprised of four main steps. First, sheets of material are cut into blank units by a blanking line. The blanks are then loaded into an automatic furnace and heated over a defined period of time to 930�C. After the heating process is complete, they are transferred into a press. Immediately upon transfer into the press, the material is stamped to a complex shape while being cooled at a minimum cooling rate of 50�C per second while inside the die. The newly produced part has an ultra-high strength of 1500 Mpa, as opposed to ca. 550 Mpa with cold stamped boron steel. Following this process, the produced part needs to be cut and pierced using a laser. We are the largest global supplier of press hardening parts and, our press hardening production lines cover the entire value chain from the manufacturing of our own dies to production lines. The close cooperation between our R&D and process know-how has resulted in the creation of a highly sophisticated and patented ‘‘Tailored Material Property’’ or ‘‘TMP’’ design. TMP is a specific press hardening process with which we can produce different strength levels in different areas of the same part, using the same equipment inside the dies but controlling the different hardening temperatures during the cooling process. Press hardening using the TMP design process is changing the car body architecture. TMP technology, creating deformable soft zones, allows us to provide new product offerings that provide better crash behavior and controlled car body deformation than other products. Using the TMP design process, we are also able to achieve up to 20% weight reduction when compared with other products made using traditional methods. 26APR201620040155 _Cold Forming_ Cold forming technologies include forming operations in different types of machines. Sub-categories of cold forming include roll forming and hydro-forming. Cold forming allows us to manufacture a range of parts from small reinforcement parts to a complete car body side. Cold forming involves the transformation of a sheet of metal at room temperature inside a forming die under pressure. We operate various kinds of cold forming presses with different automation concepts with press forces ranging from 200 tons up to 2,500 tons. In order to achieve complex forms, parts must be 89 26APR201620040155 ----- pressed or stamped and cut in several steps, under different press technologies. Depending on the size and shape of the part we can choose the press process operations used to stamp the parts. For instance: - For large parts, we use tandem presses where the material is moved by robots from press to press in five or six operations. - For medium size parts with cupped shapes, we use transfer presses, where the material is moved inside the die by transfer bars in up to six operations. During the transfer press stamping process steel coil sheet is fed into a press and a blank is created where the material is cut from the coil strip. The blank is then pushed or transferred to the next station where the rough cup is created. The cup is then transferred by mechanical fingers to one or more subsequent draw stations until the rough, final shape has been created. The part is then transferred into additional stations that are used to establish critical diameters and lengths, features, and forms. - For small size parts, we use progressive presses, where the material is always connected with the stamped part in the material strip and the finished part is separated from the strip after several forming and cutting operations. Progressive presses are mainly used for some deep draw stamping where the length to diameter ratio is low and part side features are not required. In progressive presses, the steel coil sheet is not cut, but is fed through the press. After several forming and cutting operations, and only once finished, the stamped part is separated from the material strip. We operate presses in the upper range of forces of greater than 1,000 tons and consequently we are able to stamp high strength materials, which have a typical strength up to 1,000 MPa. Ultra-high strength steels are an important part of weight reduction solutions for the car body structure and have a significant impact where material thickness and strengths are required. Roll forming is a cold forming process, where a coil strip is subjected to a bending operation by passing the strip through sets of rollers resulting in continuous deformation. Each set of rollers performs an incremental part of the bend, until the desired cross-section profile is obtained. This process is ideal for producing parts with constant profiles, long lengths and in large quantities. We operate several variations of roll forming and can also perform automatic cutting, piercing, separating and laser welding. With this range of capabilities we can manufacture parts with minimum material usage. Hydroforming is a specialized type of cold forming that uses a high pressure hydraulic fluid to press room temperature tubes into a die. The process consists of pre-bending a metallic tube and placing this pre-shaped tube inside a die with the desired cross sections and forms, and applying pressure to the inside of the tube held by the die. During the blowing or forming of the tube held in the die, holes can be pierced into the tube thereby avoiding secondary operations in most cases. Hydroforming allows complex shapes with concavities to be formed, which would be difficult or impossible with standard stamping. Hydroforming is considered to be a cost-effective way of shaping metal into lightweight, structurally stiff, complex and strong pieces. One of the advantages of using this process is that it enables us to create a three dimensional tube that in cold stamping could only be manufactured by welding two shells together. The ability to deform thick materials makes this technology useful for chassis applications in particular. _Assembly_ During the assembly stage, we effectively combine components of all our different manufacturing processes using welding, clinching and adhesive technologies. Our factories use the most advanced technologies for assembling complex parts such as complete chassis and engine cradles using advanced assembly technologies such as metal inert gas welding (MIG) or metal active gas welding (MAG). For advanced light weight products such as ultra high strength steel and press hardening parts, we use for cutting mainly solid state disc laser and for welding purposes we use cutting-edge laser welding and plasma technology of blanks in addition to resistant medium frequency (MF 1000Hz) spot welding technology for the assemblies. Our welding cells are typically highly automated and we use robots to perform several of the most precise operations inside the welding cells to achieve maximum cost reduction and ensure we produce the highest quality assemblies. We use a special process of laser welding in all the different aspects of our production. For instance, the Tailor Welded Blank (‘‘TWB’’) process involves the welding of two flat metal blanks, thereby creating a single product with different thicknesses or comprising several different types of materials. TWB products are important in the weight reduction of the car body structure and can be combined with any types of material for cold forming and press hardening. 90 ----- Laser welding technology is not limited to flat material welding and is used also to weld different parts into an assembly. The advantages of laser welding are the very short time cycles and minimal deformation due to the reduced thermic effect. _Finishing_ We use various finishing technologies such as shot blasting, zinc coating, powder coating and cataphoretic painting on our products. Shot blasting is used to clean surfaces such as uncoated steels, mainly in press hardening and to prepare parts for welding and painting. Zinc coating is used for maximum corrosion protection and is applied to chassis components. Powder coating and painting operations are the basis for any assembly for normal corrosion requirements. Finishing is always a fully automated process so as to guarantee the highest quality finish and to meet pre-agreed product specifications and requirements. _Processes specifically used in our Mechanisms segment_ Hinges are made of three different raw materials with different manufacturing processes. We may use sheet metal and use a stamping process in progressive dies. We may also use other raw materials such as profiles, which are first sawn and then finely milled and profiled by automated milling centers. The manufacture of hinges involves partial zinc coating and the final assembly on specific assembly-lines with screwing and riveting processes. The manufacture of door checks involves plastic injection molding. The manufacture of driver controls may additionally involve cataphoretic painting. Powered systems production is mainly based on the assembly of purchased electrical and mechanical components on customized assembly lines.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

Our Chassis business unit is also working on solutions tailored for electric vehicles. In Mechanisms, our R&D teams continue to develop and design innovative hinge systems, driver control and powered systems, focused on weight reduction, ease of use in entering and exiting the vehicle, as well as safety. With regard to weight reduction, our teams have developed hinge systems using aluminum, plastic reinforced with carbon fiber, as well as high strength steel. Products developed by us also protect pedestrians: the ‘‘Pop-up’’ Function of its hood hinges lead to cushioning the head of a pedestrian in case of an accident. Our expertise in the development of spindle drives for powered liftgates as well as active/ adaptive door checks enhance the passenger’s experience entering and exiting the vehicle. In addition, the adaptive door check protects the vehicle door from collisions with the environment. We are perceived in Mechanisms as the innovation leader by our customers: We have introduced the first plastic door check (ECC Edscha Corporate Check) in the market, the first spindle drive for automatic liftgates and will next year be the first supplier worldwide who launches a carbon fiber hood hinge in the market. Our past R&D activities have resulted in a number of new proprietary manufacturing processes and products including, for example, the TMP design technology described above, which enables us to create specifically targeted material properties in precision targeted areas of the part and which allows our clients to optimize weight and control the crash performance. See ‘‘—Manufacturing processes’’. The recent innovation programs at R&D are showing new material and process development in the ultrahigh strength steel press hardening areas where we managed to create a process using zinc coated boron steel. The result is an increase of productivity with a significant increase of corrosion protection at the same cost level. We believe furthermore that this new process technology in zinc, will reduce investment levels for manufacturing equipment and that we will be at the forefront in offering this process to the OEMs in the coming years, resulting in a range of complete new press hardening design products. Although the share of steel products we produce largely reflects the share of steel used by our OEM customers in the vehicles they produce, we apply aluminum in several of our plants to produce aluminum components for several of our OEM customers globally. We are a strategic partner for some important premium brands in aluminum chassis development, and we collaborate with them in light-weighting and aluminum technologies. We also use carbon fiber in numerous protoype development projects, as part of our work on multi-material solutions for our customers. We are active in R&D with regard to new material applications and joining technologies and believe that we are well positioned as a multi-material solutions provider to employ the best combinations of steel, aluminum and all types of fiber components (or other materials such as carbon) for our OEM customers. Our close working relationships with the OEMs results in a deep understanding of our customers’ requirements and constraints. This major advantage enables us to provide innovative, customized and cost effective products that address their needs and which consolidates our relationship with them as a core supplier and co-developer of strategic importance. For example, we routinely showcase our R&D capabilities to OEMs around the world. In 2015, we implemented several ‘‘Tech Shows’’ in China and Japan which have allowed us to increase the awareness of our brand, in particular with Toyota, Honda and Nissan, and have served as a basis for strengthening our long-standing business relations with our OEMs.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

We believe that our customers perceive us as a supplier that is capable on a global scale of providing: 1) high-quality products at competitive prices with standardized high-level quality; 2) innovative solutions for complex projects; and 3) on-time delivery and quality customer service. Our technical expertise and extensive global footprint have enabled us to win complex mandates on global projects with the top OEMs around the globe. For example, we were entrusted by Volkswagen to manufacture Class A surfaces, Body-in-White structural components and Chassis components in Chattanooga for the Cross-Blue, their first midsize SUV to be produced in the North American market, with start of production expected by the end of 2016. This project is our 15th hot stamping line in North America and our 58th throughout our global footprint. As one of the top three Chassis suppliers worldwide, we are introducing our Chassis activity to the U.S. market through this project. Project awards in the automotive OEM business involve long-term production arrangements based on the lifecycle of the specific model or platform. As a result of our strategic and long term relationships with our OEM customers, and given the prohibitive operational, technical and logistical costs of switching, particularly during the life cycle of a specific vehicle model, we have strong visibility on our mid-term revenues.

All of these components and raw materials are available from numerous sources. We employ just-in-time manufacturing and sourcing systems enabling us to meet customer requirements for faster deliveries while minimizing our need to carry significant inventory levels. The primary raw material used in our business is steel, which in the last five years represented approximately 40% of our sales. Approximately 60% of our steel is typically purchased through OEM re-sale programs, under which an OEM customer negotiates directly with the steel suppliers the price of the steel that we use to manufacture components for such OEM. Such negotiated steel price is passed through to the OEM customer in the sale price of the automotive component. The remainder of our steel purchasing requirements is typically met through contracts with steel suppliers that we negotiate. Historically, we have negotiated with our OEM customers to pass through the increase or decrease in the steel price, eliminating significant volatility in our cost base relating to volatility in steel prices. Due to our strong relationships with OEMs and the large steel volumes we acquire in the market place, we expect to be able negotiate competitive steel contracts from suppliers and to pass through cost increases to our customers, thus stabilizing the effect on our results.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

Once a supplier has been designated to supply parts for a new program, an OEM usually will continue to purchase those parts from the designated producer for the life of the program, although not necessarily for a redesign. OEMs typically rigorously evaluate suppliers based on many criteria such as quality, price/cost competitiveness, system and product performance, reliability and timeliness of delivery, new product and technology development capability, excellence and flexibility in 94 ----- operations, degree of global and local presence, effectiveness of customer service and overall management capability. We believe that we compete effectively with other leading suppliers in our market.

As of December 31, 2015, we had 33,192 employees globally, of which 46.1%, 14.8%, 12.0%, 12.3% and 14.8% were based in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America and Asia, respectively. 98 ----- Our strategy is to manage relations with our employees primarily on a plant level, with the ‘‘plant works council’’ being the forum for employee representation most favored by our employees. As a general rule, each plant has its own collective agreement. This policy allows us to benefit from a number of advantages: - collective agreements are adapted to the specific circumstances and needs of each plant (for example different geographic areas within a country may have different average salary or cost of living allowances); - collective agreements can be adapted to the economic performance and productivity of each plant; and - workers identify themselves better with their own ‘‘plant works council’’ rather than with a country level one. In addition to this strategy, we try to build open and trusting relations with union representatives at regional level or country level, in order to allow a bi-directional communication channel to provide them with relevant information, but also to understand their real worries and concerns. During the global economic crisis, we proactively managed our employee requirements while endeavoring to find constructive measures to manage and retain experienced professionals. Given the global nature of our business and operations, the measures implemented required an in-depth analysis of the legal framework of each jurisdiction in which we operate. Our extensive global footprint has also given us a tool to fight the impact of the global economic crisis as it has allowed for increased geographical mobility and provided us with the ability to temporarily balance our resources across different regions, supporting strategic projects with the most skilled and experienced workers. Where the opportunities have arisen and it has been possible to do so, we have deployed under-utilized staffing resources from one area of our business to other areas experiencing increased staffing requirements. As a result, we have been able to leverage the know-how of our experienced professionals to ensure that the new plants are well supervised by a trained workforce, achieving the required quality standards, while also retaining key resources. In addition, we have been able to maintain a streamlined temporary workforce which allows us to react to the evolving demands of our business, partially mitigating the negative effects of the global economic crisis in a short period of time. Where necessary and where the legal and regulatory labor and employment framework in a jurisdiction allows, we have implemented measures such as temporary reduction of the workforce, early retirement programs (as a way to achieve cost reduction in the short term and to reduce the average age of the staff in the medium to long term) and ‘‘Substitute Contracts’’ which has proven to be an efficient way to manage costs and rejuvenate the workforce, while accommodating the aging population. 99 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. 122 ----- The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. In addition, it should be noted that recent case law suggests that, in the event that incumbent directors are replaced as a result of a contested election, issuers may nevertheless avoid triggering a change of control under a clause similar to clause (4) of the definition of ‘‘Change of Control,’’ if the outgoing directors were to approve the new directors for the purpose of such change of control clause. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. Subject to the covenants described below, the Company could enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations which, though not constituting a Change of Control under the Indenture, could increase the amount of outstanding debt or otherwise affect the Company’s capital structure or credit ratings. In addition, we may not be able to finance the payments required for a Change of Control Offer.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values. 129 ----- For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (1) if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euros, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction will be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (2) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (3) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to an agreement intended to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in euros, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such currency agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such amount plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such currency agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

This summary deals only with notes that are held as capital assets by a U.S. holder (as defined below) who acquired our notes upon original issuance at their ‘‘issue price’’ (the first price at which a substantial amount of notes is sold to investors for cash, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). For purposes of this summary, a ‘‘U.S. holder’’ means a beneficial owner of the notes that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes any of the following: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the U.S.; - a corporation created or organized under the laws of the U.S., any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the U.S. and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), and applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. This summary does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxes, does not address any U.S. federal taxes other than U.S. federal income taxes (such as estate or gift taxes or the Medicare tax on certain investment income) and does not deal with any foreign, state, local or other tax considerations that may be relevant to U.S. holders in light of their particular circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address: - tax consequences to holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, persons that have ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the U.S., financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein), holders who hold their notes through a non-U.S. broker or other non-U.S. intermediary, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt entities or insurance companies; - tax consequences to persons holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or conversion transaction or a straddle; - tax consequences to persons holding the notes in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the U.S.; - tax consequences to holders of the notes whose ‘‘functional currency’’ is not the U.S. dollar; or - alternative minimum tax consequences, if any.

In addition to interest on the notes (without reduction for any tax withheld from the interest payments you receive), you will be required to include in income any Additional Amounts paid in respect of such tax withheld. You may be entitled to deduct or credit any tax withheld, subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest on a note (including any Additional Amounts) generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income or, in the case of certain U.S. holders, general category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances. If you hold notes and you use the cash basis method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of any interest payment made in euros, determined by translating the euros received at the ‘‘spot rate’’ in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest but you may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros so received. If you hold notes and you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to any interest payment made in euros in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the euro-denominated interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate of exchange for the period or periods (or portions thereof) in such taxable year during which such interest accrued. Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on (i) the last day of the interest accrual period, (ii) the last day of the taxable year for any portion of any accrual period ending on the last day of such taxable year, or (iii) the date the interest payment is received, if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. This election will apply to all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’). Upon receipt of an interest payment made in euros (including amounts received upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note attributable to accrued but unpaid interest), a U.S. holder using the accrual method will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss, generally treated as ordinary income or loss, in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate in effect on the date of receipt) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest previously included in income with respect to such payment, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated, for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source ordinary income or loss, and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

Your adjusted tax basis in a note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros paid for such note determined at the spot rate at the time of purchase. If your note is sold, exchanged, retired, redeemed or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for euros, then your amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. However, if you are a cash method taxpayer and the notes are traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes, euros paid or received will be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. An accrual method taxpayer may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase or sale of notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by such U.S. holder. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, any gain or loss recognized will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition, you have held the note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss realized by you on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note would generally be treated as U.S. source gain or loss. A portion of any gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a note may be treated as exchange gain or loss. Any exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source gain or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. For these purposes, the principal amount of the note is your purchase price for the note calculated in euros on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date you purchased the note (or, possibly, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement dates of such purchase and taxable disposition, if the note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes).

In this case, the Spanish holder may credit the withholding against his or her final IIT liability for the relevant tax year. _Net Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)_ Reestablishment of the Net Wealth Tax (NWT), which was originally foreseen for years 2011 and 2012, has been also extended for years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. In general terms, for tax year 2016, Spanish resident tax individuals are subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax (Spanish Law 19/1991), which imposes a tax on property and rights in excess of A700,000 held at December 31st for each year. Spanish tax resident individuals whose net worth is above A700,000 and who hold notes on the last day of any year would therefore be subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax for such year at marginal rates varying between 0.2% and 2.5% of the average market value of the notes during the last quarter of such year. Notwithstanding the above, Spanish regions are authorized to set their own tax rates and allowances and also to modify the minimum tax exemption. Therefore, an analysis must be made in each specific case to determine to what extent any regional legislation might be applicable, since there might be differences depending on the region in which an investor resides.

It is necessary to take into account that the IGT is a tax, in some relevant aspects (including certain tax benefits), which has been transferred to the Spanish regions and, following this power, some territories have, in practice, eliminated the taxation.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of the notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, an Initial Purchaser, a Guarantor or any of their respective affiliates are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (‘‘PTCEs’’) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84 14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90 1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91 38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95 60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96 23 respecting transactions determined by in house asset managers.

(2) It is not an ‘‘affiliate’’ (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Issuer or acting on behalf of the Issuer and it is either: (a) a qualified institutional buyer and is aware that any sale of the notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A and the acquisition of the notes will be for its own account or for the account of another qualified institutional buyer; or (b) a non-U.S. person purchasing the notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

(5) Each noteholder agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the notes, and each subsequent noteholder by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such notes prior to the date (the ‘‘Resale Restriction Termination Date’’) that is one year (in the case of Rule 144A notes) or 40 days (in the case of Regulation S notes) after the later of the date of the original issue of the notes and the last date on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates was the owner of such notes (or any predecessor thereto) only: (a) to the Issuer; 185 ----- (b) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act; (c) for so long as the notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to a person it reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer that purchases for its own account or for the account of another qualified institutional buyer to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act; (d) pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act; or (e) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (d) or (e) above to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse side of the notes is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee.

136_1,Offerings 2016.md,522,ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,522.1,,522.1.1,,"The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and none of its directors are residents of the United States. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the Issuer’s assets and a substantial portion of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or such persons, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. Federal or state securities laws. We have been advised that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters in the territory of the United States and in commercial matters in the territory of Luxembourg. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to articles 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg _Nouveau Code de Proc´edure Civile. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met: - the U.S. judgment is enforceable (executoire) in the United States; - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter under applicable U.S. Federal or state jurisdiction rules, and that jurisdiction is recognized by Luxembourg private international and local law; - the U.S. court has applied to the dispute the substantive law which would have been applied by the Luxembourg conflict of laws rules; - the U.S. Court order or judgment must not have been rendered subsequent to an evasion of Luxembourg law (‘‘fraude `a la loi’’); - the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the laws of Luxembourg or has been given in proceedings of a criminal nature; - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws; and - the judgment was granted following proceedings where the principles of natural justice have been complied with, and where the counterparty was granted the necessary time to prepare its case, had the opportunity to appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense. In practice, Luxembourg courts now tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although there is no clear statutory prohibition of such review. If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law if its application contravenes Luxembourg’s international public policy. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis, for instance, of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Further, the following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in Spain is based upon advice provided to us by our Spanish legal advisers. Any judgment obtained against Spanish companies outside of Spain (and, in particular, in the United States), but other than in a country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the Spanish Law of Civil Procedure 1/2000 of January 7, 2000 (‘‘Spanish Civil Procedure Law’’) and with the Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters, 29/2015 of July 30, 2015 (‘‘Law 29/2015’’), by the courts of Spain (unless such judgment contravenes principles of Spanish public policy) in the following situations: - according to the provisions of any applicable treaty, there being none currently in existence between Spain and the United States for these purposes; 189 ----- - in the absence of any such treaty the judgment would be recognized and enforced in Spain if it satisfies all of the following requirements, in accordance with Law 29/2015: (i) the judgment is final (firme) (i.e., not subject to further appeal) and is of an enforceable nature (fuerza ejecutiva) in the foreign country; (ii) the foreign court has not disregarded materially the rights of defense of any party; in particular, where the judgment was given in default of appearance, this requirement will not be met if the defendant was not duly served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his defense; (iii) the jurisdiction of the foreign court does not infringe an exclusive jurisdiction of Spanish courts; (iv) the jurisdiction of the foreign court is considered reasonable; the jurisdiction of the foreign court will be considered reasonable if in similar circumstances a Spanish court would also have jurisdiction according to Spanish rules; (v) the judgment is not irreconcilable with a judgment given in Spain; (vi) the judgment is not irreconcilable with an earlier judgment given in another State provided that the earlier judgment fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in Spain; (vii) are no prior proceedings between the same parties and in relation to the same issues pending in Spain; (viii) the judgment is not contrary to public policy (orden p´ublico); and (ix) the company is not subject to an insolvency proceeding in Spain. Additionally and according to article 47 of Law 29/2015, there is a special provision and a special rule concerning the recognition of foreign judgments rendered in proceedings resulting from collective action, which may be recognized and enforced in Spain insofar as they satisfy the conditions set forth therein. Any party wishing to have a U.S. ruling enforced in Spain must file an application seeking declaration of enforceability of the U.S. resolution (exequatur) which must be filed with the relevant Spanish First Instance Court (Juzgado de Primera Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil). Once a judgment has been recognized under the exequatur procedure, it will be enforceable in Spain in accordance with the Spanish Civil Procedure Law. The enforcement of any judgments in Spain involves, inter alia, the following principal actions and costs: (a) documents in a language other than Spanish must be accompanied by a sworn translation into Spanish (translator’s fees will be payable); (b) foreign documents may be required to be legalized and apostilled; (c) certain court fees must be paid; and (d) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be directed by an attorney-at-law and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador). In addition, Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and such rules will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the relevant agreement. 190 -----",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

Land is not depreciated and is presented net of any impairment charges. Acquisition cost includes: - Purchase Price. - Discounts for prompt payment, which are deducted from the asset’s carrying value. - Directly attributable costs incurred to ready the asset for use. Prior to the IFRS transition date (January 1, 2007), certain Group companies revalued certain items of property, plant, and equipment as permitted under applicable legislation (Royal Decree-Law 7/1996, Basque regional law 6/1996 and several international laws). The amount of these revaluations is considered part of the cost of the assets as provided for under IAS 1. At the transition date to EU-IFRSs (January 1, 2007), property, plant and equipment was measured at fair value at the said date, based on the appraisals of an independent expert, which generated a revaluation of Group assets (Note 6). The carrying value of property, plant, and equipment acquired by means of a business combination is measured by its fair value at the moment of its incorporation into the Group (Note 2.4c). Specific spare parts: certain major parts of some items of plant and equipment may require replacement at irregular intervals. The cost of these parts is capitalized when the part is replaced and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The net carrying amount of replaced parts is retired with a charge to income when the replacement occurs. Ordinary repair or maintenance work is not capitalized. An item of property, plant, and equipment is retired upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on retirement of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the net carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year the asset is retired. As permitted under revised IAS 23, borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or development of a qualifying asset—an asset that takes more than one year to be ready for its intended use—are capitalized as part of the cost of the respective assets.

For companies whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency, the value of the goodwill recognized is updated using the rate of exchange prevailing at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date, recognizing in Translation differences the differences between beginning and ending balances, according to IAS 21, considered it is part of the acquired business assets. If the Company’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable acquired assets, assumed liabilities, and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the Company reconsiders the identification and measurement of the assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of the acquired company, as well as the measurement of the cost of the business combination (even non-monetary). The Company recognizes any excess that continues to exist after this reconsideration in the income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units expected to benefit from the business combination’s synergies, irrespective of any other Group assets or liabilities assigned to those units or groups of units. Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit or groups of cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units is less than the carrying amount, the Group recognizes an impairment loss (Note 2.4g).",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

Classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.

A cash-generating unit (CGU) is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash flows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized. Impairment losses with respect to CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGUs and, then, to reduce proportionally the carrying amount of the assets of the CGU unless, based on a review of the individual assets, it is considered that their fair value less costs to sell is higher than their carrying amount.

This led to modify the accounting and consolidation methods of the following companies: The effect of the application of IFRS 10 and 11 in the Consolidated Financial Statements is the following: 2.3 Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company and subsidiaries as per December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The Group obtains control when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. In particular the Group controls a subsidiary if and only if it has: - Power over the subsidiary (rights that give the ability to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary) - Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement in the subsidiary - The ability to use its power over the subsidiary to affect the amount of the investor’s returns When the Group does not hold the majority of voting rights or similar rights of the subsidiary, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances to assess the existence of control. This includes: - Contractual agreements with other investors holding voting rights of the subsidiary - Rights arisen from other contractual agreements - Potential voting rights of the Group - Power over relevant activities of the subsidiary The Group reassesses the existence of control over a subsidiary when facts and circumstances indicate changes in one or more elements determining control (Note 3). Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the acquisition date, when the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases. If the Group loses or relinquishes control of a subsidiary, the Consolidated Financial Statements include that subsidiary’s results for the portion of the year during which the Group held control. The financial statements of the subsidiaries have the same closing date as the parent company, except for the companies mentioned in Annex I. The said companies have an additional closing for the financial year for their inclusion to the Consolidated Financial Statements, being elaborated with the same accounting policies in a uniform and coherent procedure. The profit of a subsidiary is attributed to non-controlling interest even if it means registering a receivable balance. Changes in shareholding percentage that do not mean loss of control are reflected as an equity transaction. When the Group lose control of a subsidiary: - Derecognizes assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of said subsidiary. - Derecognizes carrying amount of non-controlling interests. - Derecognizes the translation differences recognized in equity. - Recognizes the fair value of the amount received for the transaction. - Recognizes the fair value of any retained investment. - Recognizes any excess or deficit in the consolidated income statement. - Reclassifies the shareholding of the Company in the items previously recognized in ‘‘Other Comprehensive Income’’ to profit or to retained earnings, as appropriate. F-17 ----- _Subsidiaries_ The full consolidation method is used for companies meeting the following requirements: I. Companies in which the Company holds a direct or indirect interest of over 50%, which gives it more than half the voting rights on the entity’s governing bodies. II. Companies over which the Company exercises effective management control, irrespective of the shareholding percentage, by virtue of holding the majority of voting rights on the entity’s governing bodies. _Joint Ventures_ Investments in joint ventures are consolidated using the equity method until the date on which the Group ceases to have joint control over the venture. A joint venture is an arrangement whereby the parties have joint control of the rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractual agreement to share control and it exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. _Joint Operations_ A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities. Those parties are called joint operators. The joint operations where the Group acts as joint operator are consolidated under proportionally consolidation method. _Associates_ Investments in which the Group has significant influence but not control have been consolidated under the equity method. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but it does not imply control or joint control on those policies. Considerations to make in order to decide whether there is significant influence are similar to those made to decide whether there is control over an investee. For the purposes of the preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, significant influence is deemed to exist in investments in which the Group, directly or indirectly, holds over 20% of the voting power, and in certain instances where the Group’s holding is less than 20%, but significant influence can be clearly demonstrated. _Translation of the financial statements of foreign operations_ The assets and liabilities and income statements of foreign operations included in the consolidation scope whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency are translated to euro using the closing foreign exchange rates method as follows: - The assets, rights, and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the consolidated balance sheet date. - Income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate, so long as that average is a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the actual exchange rates prevailing at the transaction dates. F-18 ----- The differences between the value of equity of the foreign companies converted using historical exchange rates and including the net result from the income statement reflecting the above mentioned treatment of income and expenses in foreign currencies, and the net book value resulting from the conversion of assets, rights and liabilities using the exchange rate prevailing at the consolidated balance sheet date, are registered as ‘‘Translation differences’’, with the corresponding negative or positive sign, in Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (Note 15). Exchange gains and losses due to the impact of changes in the functional currency relative to the euro on foreign currency borrowings considered permanent are taken directly to equity under ‘‘Translation differences’’, net of the tax effect. The net amount of negative translation differences at December 31, 2015 amounted to 16 million euros (2014: 20 million euros in negative translation differences; 2013: 13 million euros). At December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 the subsidiaries held no shares issued by the Company. The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, when presenting the Statement of Cash Flows by indirect method, has been calculated considering an average for the year of Cash and cash equivalents and applying the foreign exchange rates at closing of each year for the rest of the captions of this statement. _Transactions between companies included in the consolidation scope_ The following transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation: - Reciprocal receivables/payables and expenses/income relating to intra-Group transactions. - Income from the purchase and sale of property, plant, and equipment as well as unrealized gains on inventories, if the amount is significant. - Intra-Group dividends and the debit balance corresponding to interim dividends recognized at the company that paid them. _Shareholders/non-controlling interest_ The value of non-controlling interests in the equity and profit (loss) for the year of consolidated subsidiaries consolidated by the full consolidation method is recognized in ‘‘Equity attributable to non-controlling interests’’ within the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in ‘‘Profit for the year attributable to non-controlling interests’’ in the Consolidated Income Statement and in ‘‘Non-controlling interests’’ in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, respectively. 2.4 Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies used in preparing the 2015, 2014, and 2013 consolidated financial statements were as follows: losses arising on the settlement of these transactions or on translating foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at closing rates are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement. When the net book value of an individual item from property, plant and equipment is higher than their recoverable value, impairment is considered and the value of the item is decreased until recoverable value. The Group has also participations in associates, business over which the Group has significant influence. Participations in associates and jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method. According to this method, the investment in an associate or a jointly controlled entity is initially recorded at cost. From the acquisition date on, the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to reflect the changes of the investor’s share of the net assets of the associate and the jointly controlled entity. The goodwill related to the associate or jointly controlled entity is included in the carrying amount of the investment and it is not amortised and no specific impairment test related is done. The share of the Group in profits of operations of the associate or joint venture is reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement. When there has been a change recognized directly in equity by the associate or joint venture, the Group recognizes its share of this change, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Non-realized gains or losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate or joint venture corresponding to the share of the Group in the associate or joint venture are eliminated. The share of the Group in profits of the associate or joint venture is reflected directly in the Consolidated Income Statement and it represents profit after taxes and non-controlling interests. The financial statements of the associate and the joint venture are prepared for the same period than the Group; the required adjustments and reclassifications have been made in consolidation in order to harmonize the policies and methods used by the Group. After using the equity method, the Group decides if impairment losses on the investment in the associate or joint venture have to be recognised. At closing date the Group consider if there are evidences of impairment of the investment in the associate or joint venture. If so, the impairment is calculated as the difference between the recoverable amount and the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture and the amount of such impairment is recognized in ‘‘Share of profits from associates- equity method’’ in the Consolidated Income Statement. When the significant influence of the Group in the associate or joint venture ceases, the Group recognises the investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture in the moment of loss of significant influence and the fair value of the investment plus the income for sale is recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement. Capitalized development costs are amortized over the period of expected future benefits. _Concessions, patents, licenses and trademarks._ These intangible assets are initially measured at acquisition cost. They are assessed as having a finite useful life and are accordingly carried at cost net of accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method, based on the estimated useful life, in all instances less than 5 years. _Software_ Software is measured at acquisition cost. Software acquired from third parties and capitalized is amortized over its useful life, which in no instance will exceed 5 years. IT maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. _Loans and receivables_ Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are classified as current, except for those maturing in more than 12 months from the balance sheet date. They are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment charges. _Available-for-sale financial assets_ There are financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified in any of the three preceding categories. They are classified as non-current unless management plans to dispose of them within 12 months from the balance sheet date. They are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. Unrealized gains or losses are recognized directly in equity until the investment is retired or is impair, at which time the cumulative gain or loss recorded in equity is recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement. _Investments in associates accounted for using the equity method_ Investments in associates, companies in which the Group has significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method. _Derecognition of financial instruments_ The Group retires a transferred financial asset from the Consolidated Balance Sheet when it has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or, retaining these rights, when the Group has assumed a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to a third party, and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset. If the entity has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset, the entity does not retire the transferred asset from its balance sheet and recognizes a financial liability for the consideration received. This financial liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost. The transferred financial asset continues to be measured using the same criteria as prior to the transfer. In subsequent periods, the Group recognizes any income on the transferred asset and any expense incurred on the financial liability in the consolidated income statement. Such income and expense are not offset. When assessing value in use, estimated future cash-flows are discounted to present value by using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market valuations of money and risks specific to the asset. For calculating the fair value of the asset less costs to sell, recent transactions are considered and if they cannot be identified, a proper valuation method is used. These calculations are based on several considerations, market prices and other available indicators of the fair value. The calculation of impairment is based on detailed budgets and forecasts separately prepared for each CGU to which the asset is allocated. Those budgets and forecasts refer to a five-year period and for longer periods a long-term growing rate is calculated and used for estimating cash-flows after the fifth year. The impairment losses from continued operations, including impairment of inventories, are recognized in the consolidated income statement in the expenses related to the function of the impaired asset. For all assets except goodwill, an assessment is made every year to see if there is evidence that the impairment registered in previous years has been reduced or has disappeared. In such case, the Group estimates the recoverable value of the asset or the CGU. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed, with the reversal recognized in the income statement, if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount. The restated recoverable amount of the asset cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized. The following assets present specific characteristics when assessing their impairment: _Consolidation Goodwill_ At year end as well as when there is evidence that goodwill may be impaired, it is tested for impairment. The impairment tests for the goodwill assess the recoverable value of each CGU which it has been allocated to. If the recoverable value of the CGU is lower than the goodwill’s carrying amount, an impairment loss is registered. Goodwill impairment losses cannot be reversed in future periods. _Intangible assets_ The Group has implemented annual procedures to test intangible assets with indefinite useful life for impairment. This assessment is carried out annually for each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs to which the intangible asset has been assigned, as well as when there is evidence that those intangible assets may be impaired. _Impairment of financial assets_ The reduction in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets that has been recognized directly in equity when there is objective evidence of impairment must be recognized in the consolidated income statement for the year. The cumulative loss recognized in the income statement is measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value. Once an equity investment classified as available-for-sale has been impaired, any increase in value is registered in ‘‘Other comprehensive income’’ with no effect on the profit or loss for the year. In the case of debt instruments classified as available-for-sale assets, if the fair value of an impaired debt instrument subsequently increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in the income statement, the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement. The recoverable amount of held-to-maturity investments and loans and receivables carried at amortized cost is calculated as the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the original effective F-25 ----- interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the consolidated income statement. Current investments are not discounted to present value. Impairment losses on loans and receivables carried at amortized cost are reversed if the subsequent increase in the recoverable amount can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized. The amounts to be recognized in profit and loss are: - Current service cost. - Any past service cost and gains or losses upon payment. - Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) which is determined by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability (asset). The past service costs will be recognized as expenses at the earlier of the following dates (i) in the period when the plan is amended or curtailment occurs (ii) when the Group recognizes related restructuring costs or benefits of termination. The net defined benefit liability (asset) is the deficit or surplus, detailed below, adjusted for any effect of limiting a net defined benefit asset to the asset ceiling. The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. The rate used to discount post-employment benefit obligations shall be determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. The deficit or surplus is: - The present value of the defined benefit obligation. - Less the fair value of plan assets (if any). Plan assets comprise assets held by a long-term employee benefit fund, and qualifying insurance policies. These assets are not available to the reporting entity’s own creditors and cannot be returned to the reporting entity. Fair value is based on market price and in case of stock market values, it corresponds to published prices. _Indemnities_ Indemnities to pay to employees dismissed through no fault of their own are calculated based on years of service. Any expenses incurred for indemnities are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement as soon as they are known. Revenue is recognized at fair value of the balancing entry, defining fair value as the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction, taking into account the amount of any discounts or rebates provided. Revenue includes: - Sale of goods: Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the following conditions have been met: - the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods; - the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold; - the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; - it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; - the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be reliably measured. - Manufacture of tools for third party sale and rendering of services: revenue arising from the manufacture of tools for sale to third parties and the rendering of services are recognized by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date—stage of completion method. - Interest, royalties, and dividends: interest revenue is recognized as interest accrues taking into account the effective return of the asset (using the effective interest method, i.e., the rate that makes discounted future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument equal to the initial carrying amount of the asset). Royalties are recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement. Dividends are recognized when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is established. Expenses are recognized when there is a decrease in the value of an asset or an increase in the value of a liability that can be measured reliably, and they are recognized during the period in which they are incurred. _Temporary differences_ Deferred tax liabilities: a deferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except to the extent that the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and which, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor the tax result. Deferred tax assets: a deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized, unless the deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and which, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor the tax result. Estimable amounts of contingent liabilities for environmental issues, if any, would be provisioned as a liability in Consolidated Balance Sheet. 2.5 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures _1._ _Standards and interpretations adopted by the European Union applied by first time this year_ The accounting policies used in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements are the same to those applied to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 since none of the modifications to the standards or the interpretations which are first time applicable this year have impact in the Group. Regarding 2013 accounting policies as explained in note 2.2 IFRS 10/11 has been applied for the first time for the year ended December 31, 2014. _2._ _Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB but not applicable this year_ The Group intends to adopt the standards, interpretations and amendments issued by the IASB but not mandatory in the European Union at the date of these consolidated financial statements when they become effective, if applicable. The Group is currently analyzing the impact. Based on the analyses carried out to date, the Group considers that the application of these standards and amendments will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements except amendments down below. _IFRS 15 Revenue From Contracts With Customers_ IFRS 15 was published in May of 2014 and establishes a new five-step model framework applicable to revenue from customer contracts. Under IFRS 15, the amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services provided to a customer. The principles of IFRS 15 introduce a more structured approach to measuring and recognizing revenue. This new standard is applicable to all entities and supersedes all prior standards on revenue recognition. IFRS 15 must be applied retroactively either totally or in part for the years beginning on January 01, 2017; early application is also permitted. The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 and plans to adopt it by the abovementioned date. _IFRS 16 Leases_ IFRS 16 was published in January 2016 and implies significant changes for lessees since, for most leases, they will have to account an asset for the right to use and a liability for the rentals to pay. For lessors there are few changes compared to current IAS 17. This new standard supersedes prior standards on leases. IFRS 16 permits either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the years beginning on January 01, 2019 included; early application is also permitted although this standard has not been adopted by the European Union yet. The Group pretends to adopt this new standard at the required effective date by a retrospective transition approach. The Group has started a preliminary assessment of IFRS 16 and the effects on their consolidated financial statements. _Company as lessee_ The main effect in Group financial statements is the recognition in balance sheet of the right to use and the corresponding liability related to operating leases. As mentioned in Note 28, future minimum payments for non-cancellable operating leases amount to 439,838 thousand euros at December 31, 2015. The Group is analyzing whether periods for those future minimum payments are similar to lease periods to use according to IFRS 16. F-32 ----- In addition there will be an increase in operating income since leasing expenses (88,038 thousand euros in 2015 (Note 28)) are eliminated and amortization and financial expenses will increase for a total amount slightly higher to that amount. _Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative_ The Group is analyzing the proposed amendments and thus expects to apply the following recommendations in its 2015 financial statements: - Eliminate immaterial information. - Structure the notes so that the most relevant matters are described at the beginning of the notes to the financial statements. - Eliminate disclosures included in the accounting policies that are included in the standards, including only Group-specific matters. The Group’s consolidated financial statements are not expected to be affected by the remaining amendments. _Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of cash-flows: Disclosure Initiative_ These amendments require the Group to present information about the changes in financial liabilities for a better understanding of movements in Group debt. The amendments will enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including changes from monetary and non-monetary operations (such as foreign exchange differences). The amendments include illustrative examples with the reconciliation between the opening and closing balances of items for which cash flows are classified as financing activities, excluding equity items and separating movements that imply cash-flows from those that do not. These amendments will become effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017 although early application is permitted. Comparative information from previous year is not required. Consequently, the amendments will not have impact until 2017, when this disclosure is required.",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 25APR201622270623 F-4 25APR201622270623 ----- 27APR201603305057 _Opinion_ In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Gestamp Automoci´on, S.A. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (‘‘IFRS—EU’’).

Tax (Continued)",2906.103.1,,"‘‘Differences in prevailing rates’’ in 2015, 2014 and 2013 reflects the differences between prevailing rates in certain operating markets and the theoretical applicable rate, mainly relating to operations taxed in the US (35%), Brazil (34%), and Argentina (35%). The permanent differences in 2015, 2014 and 2013 reflect mainly accelerated depreciation, inflation adjustments, nondeductible provisions, fiscal transparency, nondeductible differences in exchange rates, nondeductible expenses, and those differences generated in the consolidation process. The Other tax rate adjustments in Spain, reflect the appliance of law 27/2014, approved on November 27, for Corporate Income Tax in Spain, that has modified the general tax rate, from the present tax rate of 30%, to the 2015 tax rate of 28% and beyond of 2015 tax rate of 25%. Previous deferred tax assets and liabilities have been adjusted according to the tax rate changes at the reversion date. At December 31, 2015 the conversion to euros of tax loss carried forwards in other currencies, calculated at the exchange rates prevailing on that date, amounted to 872 million euros in 2015, 813 million euros in 2014 and 912 million euros in 2013. At December 31, 2015 the conversion to euros of unused tax credits carried forward in other currencies calculated at the exchange rates prevailing on that date, amounted to 145 million euros in 2015, 134 million euros in 2015 and 100 million euros in 2013. At year-end 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Group had capitalized unused tax losses and tax credits that it expects to be able to utilize in future periods based on earnings projections and the deadlines and limits for their utilization. The Group had capitalized tax credits for a total of 150 million euros of unused tax losses and unused tax credits (2014: 164 million euros 2013: 120 million euros) (Note 23.2). The unused tax losses and unused tax credits at December 31, 2015 whose corresponding tax credit has not been registered amount to 665 million euros (2014: 474 million euros 2013: 745 million euros). From that amount, 392 million euros have limitation period for their utilization between 2016 and 2034 (2014: 314 million euros with limitation period between 2015 and 2033 2013: 381 million euros with limitation period between 2014 and 2032) and the rest have no limitation period. The majority of Group companies are open to inspection of all taxes to which they are liable and for the full statute of limitations period (4 years from filing date for all Spanish companies except for those with registered offices in the Basque Country for which the period is three years, and five years, as a rule, for companies based abroad), or since the date of incorporation, if more recent. Management of the Company and its subsidiaries calculated income tax for 2015 and the years open for inspection according to the legislation prevailing in each year. Given that the prevailing tax regulations related to the above mentioned matters are subject to varying interpretations, certain tax liabilities and contingencies may exist for 2015 and previous years that cannot be objectively quantified. However, the Group’s directors and their legal and tax advisors consider that any potential tax liability which might arise would not significantly affect the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Group mainly operates in the following currencies: - Euro - US dollar - Mexican peso - Argentine peso - Brazilian real - GB pound - Swedish crown - Polish zloty - Hungarian forint - Turkish lira - Indian rupee - Korean won - Chinese yuan - Russian ruble - Czech crown - Yen - Taiwanese dollar - Thai baht F-110 ----- To manage exchange rate risk, the Group uses a series of financial instruments that give it a degree of flexibility, basically comprised of the following: A. Foreign currency forward contracts: These arrangements lock in the price at which an entity can buy or sell a currency on a set date; the timing can be adjusted to align the transactions with the hedged cash flows. B. ‘‘Puttable instruments’’: Other derivatives are also used to hedge currency risk, including those designed to lock in a maximum or minimum exchange rate (collar or tunnel) at a set settlement date.

The Group mitigates this risk by using interest rate derivatives, mainly swaps, by which it converts the floating rate on a loan into a fixed rate. It may swap the rate on a portion of the loan or on the entire loan, and for its entire duration or a part thereof. In general the Group’s borrowings are at floating rates indexed to Euribor except the bonds issued by the Group in May, 2013 which bear a fixed interest rate. Had the average interest on euro denominated financial borrowings been 5% higher or lower in 2015, all other variables remaining constant, the finance cost would have been 0.09 million euros higher or lower. Had the average interest on euro denominated financial borrowings been 5% higher or lower in 2014, all other variables remaining constant, the finance cost would have been 0.1 million euros higher or lower. Had the average interest on euro denominated financial borrowings been 5% higher or lower in 2013, all other variables remaining constant, the finance cost would not have been significantly affected. - Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that a company will not be able to service its commitments as a result of adverse conditions in the debt and/or equity markets that prevent or hinder its capital raising efforts. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash balances to enable it to negotiate refinancing on the best possible terms and to cover its near- term cash outlays, thereby avoiding the need to raise funds on disadvantageous terms.

Financial risk management objectives and policies (Continued)",2913.4.1,,"The breakdown of liquidity and capital resources at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, is as follows: _Raw Materials Price Risk_ The steel is the main raw material used in the business. In 2015 and 2014, 58% of the steel was purchased through programs of re-sale with clients, whereby the manufacturer negotiates the price of steel used by the Group in the production of automotive components. The negotiated price is directly included in the selling price customer. The rest of the purchases of steel were performed through contracts negotiated with suppliers. Historically, and in accordance with the standards of the automotive industry, the Group has been able to negotiate with clients, significantly, the transfer of the impact of variations in the price of steel. 32.2 Hedge accounting For the purpose of hedge accounting, the Group classifies its hedges as: - Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the market value of a recognized asset or liability, or of a firm commitment attributable to a specific risk. - Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to fluctuations in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction. - Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation when hedging exposure to variability in exchange rates relative to a net investment in a foreign operation. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at acquisition cost and are subsequently marked to market. Changes in fair value are normally accounted for in keeping with specific hedge accounting criteria. The accounting for these instruments is carried out as follows: - Fair value hedges: changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item, in both instances attributable to the risk hedged, are recognized in the consolidated income statement. - Cash flow hedges: changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument attributable to the risk hedged are recognized in ‘‘Retained earnings’’ in equity. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement when the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. - Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation: these hedges are accounted for in a way similar to cash flow hedges. Fair value gains or losses in these hedging instruments are recognized in ‘‘Translation differences.’’ If a foreign operation is sold, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recognized directly in equity (‘‘Retained earnings’’) is transferred to the income statement. 32.3 Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is determined as follows: - The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organized financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market prices. - Where there is no active market, fair value is determined using cash flow analysis discounted at market discount rates and based on market assumptions at the time of the estimate. _Non-current financial assets_ There is no difference between the fair value and carrying amount of non-current loans granted since they all accrue interest at floating rates. F-116 ----- Equity investments are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value when they can be valued reliably. Since it is usually not possible to measure the fair value of shareholdings in unlisted companies reliably, these investments are valued at acquisition cost or lower if there is evidence of impairment. Changes in fair value, net of the related tax effect, are recognized with a charge or credit, as appropriate, to ‘‘Retained earnings’’ within ‘‘Equity’’ until these investments are sold, at which time the cumulative amount recognized in equity is recognized in full in the consolidated income statement. If fair value is lower than acquisition cost, the difference is recognized directly in equity, unless the asset is determined to be impaired, in which case it is recognized in the consolidated income statement. _Trade receivables_ For receivables due in less than one year, the Group considers the carrying amount a reasonable approximation of fair value. _Current financial assets_ There is no difference between the fair value and carrying amount of short term loans granted since they all accrue interest at market rates. For other current financial assets, as their maturity is near the financial year end, the Group considers their carrying amounts a reasonable approximation of fair value. _Interest-bearing loans and borrowings_ For current and non-current bank borrowings there is no difference between fair value and carrying amount since all these borrowings carry interest at market rates. _Trade and other payables_ The Group’s management considers the carrying amount of the items recorded in this consolidated balance sheet line item to be a reasonable approximation of fair value. _Fair values of financial instruments_ The fair values of current and non-current financial assets and liabilities do not differ significantly from their respective carrying amounts. The Group uses the following sequence of three levels, based on the relevance of the variables used, to measure the fair value of its financial instruments: - Level 1: Unadjusted quoted price for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. - Level 2: Variables which are observably different from the prices quoted in Level 1, either directly (price), or indirectly (derived from the price). - Level 3: Variables which are not based on observable market data (non-observable variables). The classification of financial assets recognized in the financial statements, by methodology of fair value measurement, is as follows: The classification of financial liabilities at fair value in the financial statements, according to their relevant valuation methodology, is as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2016,341

Management considers that its counterparties are very creditworthy. Each business unit manages its credit risk according to policies, procedures and controls determined by the Group regarding credit risk management of customers. At each closing date, the Group companies analyze on the basis of real historical data the balances of each major client individually in order to determine the need for provisions or impairment. The Group has no guarantee on debts and has concluded that the risk concentration is low given that its customers belong to distinct jurisdictions and operate in highly independent markets. The credit risk with banks is managed by the treasury department of the Group according to the Group policies. The surplus cash investments are contracted only with authorized counterparties and always within the credit limit assigned for each counterparty. The limits are established in order to minimize risk concentration, thereby mitigating financial losses in the event of default by the counterparty. The maximum exposure of the Group to credit risk at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 amounts to the carrying values (Note 10), except for financial guarantees and derivative financial instruments.

It defines leverage as net debt (current and non-current financial borrowings less short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents) divided by total equity (consolidated equity plus grants pending release to the income statement).
