1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,120,PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION,120.4,Non-IFRS Measures,120.4.2,,"This Offering Memorandum contains measures and ratios (the “Non-IFRS Measures”), including Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Free Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures (Accrued), Total Net Debt and Senior Net Debt, that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards. We present Non-IFRS Measures herein because we believe that they are of interest to the investors and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. We believe these measures are useful as they provide a measure of operating results excluding certain items that the Group’s management believe are either outside of its recurring operating activities, or items that are non-cash. Excluding such items enables trends in the Group’s operating results and cash flow generation to be more easily observable. The Non-IFRS Measures are used by the Group internally to manage and assess the results of its operations, make decisions with respect to investments and allocation of resources, and assess the performance of management personnel. Such performance measures are also the de facto metrics used by investors and other members of the financial community to value other companies operating in the same industry as the Group and thus are a basis for comparability between the Group and its peers. The Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our, or any of our subsidiaries’, operating results as reported under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting standards. The NonIFRS Measures may also be defined differently than the corresponding terms governing our indebtedness, including the Altice Financing Indentures (as defined herein) and the Indenture. Non-IFRS Measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Free Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures (Accrued), Total Net Debt and Senior Net Debt are not measurements of our, or any of our subsidiaries’, performance or liquidity under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. In particular, you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Free Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures (Accrued), Total Net Debt and Senior Net Debt in isolation or as an alternative to (a) operating profit or profit for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of our, or any of our operating entities’, operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of our, or any of our subsidiaries’, ability to meet our cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting standards. Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Free Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures (Accrued), Total Net Debt and Senior Net Debt have certain limitations as analytical tools, including but not limited to: - they do not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments; ----- - although depreciation, amortization and impairment are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will generally need to be replaced in the future; - Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Free Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures (Accrued) do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; and - some of the other expenses and income items that we or our operating entities eliminate in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Free Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures (Accrued) reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made. Our primary Non-IFRS Measures include: - “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as, (i) for periods prior to the application of IFRS 16, operating profit before depreciation, amortization and impairment, other expenses and income (capital gains, non-recurring litigation, restructuring costs) and share-based expenses and (ii) following the application of IFRS 16, as operating profit before depreciation, amortization and impairment, other expenses and income (capital gains, non-recurring litigation, restructuring costs), share-based expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IAS 17 Leases for operating leases) allowing comparability for each of the periods presented. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Adjusted EBITDA” for more information. For a_ reconciliation of the Group’s profit/(loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA, see “Summary _Financial Information and Other Financial Data—Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA—Reconciliation of profit/(loss) from continuing operations and operating profit/(loss) to Adjusted EBITDA”._ - “Operating Free Cash Flow” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA _less Capital Expenditures (Accrued). See “Summary Financial Information and Other Financial Data—Capital Expenditures (Accrued) and Operating _Free Cash Flow” for more information. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for_ operating cash flow as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with IAS 7 (Statement of Cash Flows). - “Capital Expenditures (Accrued)” is defined as additions in tangible and intangible assets and contracts costs and include the following by activities: - the fixed business has fixed capital expenditure requirements that are mainly discretionary (network, platforms, general) and variable capital expenditure requirements related to the connection of new customers and the purchase of customer premises equipment (TV decoder, modem, etc.); - mobile capital expenditures are mainly driven by investment in new mobile sites, upgrade to new mobile technology and licenses to operate; once engaged and operational, there are limited further capital expenditure requirements; and - other capital expenditures are mainly related to costs incurred in acquiring content rights. We use the below mentioned terms and definitions, which are relevant when calculating the Non-IFRS Measures discussed above: - “Capital Expenditures (Working Capital Items)” is defined as change in fixed asset payables included in ‘Current Liabilities’ caption of the consolidated statement of financial position. - “Total Capital Expenditures” is equal to “payment to acquire tangible and intangible assets and contract costs” in our statement of cash flows, and can also be presented as the sum total of Capital Expenditures (Accrued) and Capital Expenditures (Working Capital Items). For a reconciliation of Capital Expenditures (Accrued) to payment to acquire tangible and intangible assets and contract costs, as presented in ‘net cash used in investing activities’ in the consolidated cash flow statement, see “Management’s Discussion and _Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Total Capital Expenditures”._ - “Working Capital” is defined as the sum of inventories and trade and other receivables less trade and other payables. This computation may not be comparable to that of similarly titled measures presented by other companies. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— ----- _Liquidity and Capital Resources—Current assets and liabilities including Working Capital” for more_ information.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The as adjusted financial information under “Summary Financial and Other Information—Certain As Adjusted Information” has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what the Group’s Total Net Debt or Senior Net Debt would have been had the Refinancing Transactions and the Altice Portugal FTTH Transaction occurred on such dates, nor does it purport to project the Group’s indebtedness or cash interest expense at any future date. This as adjusted financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act, the EU Prospectus Regulation, IFRS or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing or review standards. Management believes that Total Net Debt and Senior Net Debt are useful indicators of the Group’s indebtedness, financial flexibility and capital structure because they indicate the level of borrowings after taking account of cash and cash equivalents within the Group’s business that could be utilized to pay down the outstanding borrowings and since certain financial covenants and incurrence covenants under the Group’s existing indebtedness are calculated on a net basis after taking into account the cash and cash equivalents.

1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,293,GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS AND THE OFFERING,293.1,Overview,293.1.1,,"We are a multinational broadband and mobile communications, content and media group operating in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic. We have major positions in a number of segments of the telecommunications markets in which we operate, including residential fixed, residential mobile and business services, which includes B2B services and wholesale, and also offer other services, which includes media, content and advertisement services. In the geographies in which we operate, we are either the largest or the second largest fixed services provider, and a leading provider of multi-play services offering bundled triple-play (“3P”) services and, where possible, quad-play (“4P”) services and focus our marketing on our multi-play offerings. We are also the largest mobile operator in Portugal, the second largest mobile operator in the Dominican Republic, and a significant competitor to the three largest mobile operators in Israel. As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately 10,159,000 total mobile B2C subscribers and approximately 3,011,000 total fixed B2C unique customers as well as a fiber network passing approximately 8,707,000 homes in our footprint (including homes accessed through wholesale fiber operators). Our service portfolio in each of the regions in which we operate is set forth below under “— _Overview of Service Portfolio”._ The Group was created through a number of price-disciplined acquisitions of telecommunications businesses, including: PT Portugal in Portugal, HOT in Israel, and Altice Dominicana in the Dominican Republic. Our acquisition strategy has allowed us to target fiber/cable and mobile operators with what we believe to be highquality networks in markets we find attractive from an economic, competitive and regulatory standpoint and create value at the acquired businesses by implementing operational improvements and leveraging economies of scale, as well as pursuing in-market consolidation and attractive diversification with B2B, DSL and mobile add-on opportunities. Furthermore, this has enabled us to grow the acquired businesses organically while we continue to focus on cost optimization and increasing economies of scale and operational synergies as our Group develops. Moreover, as part of our strategy, we also focus on the convergence of telecommunications, media, content and advertising to offer more value to our customers. For example, since June 2017 we have owned Teads, which is a leading video advertising marketplace with, as of April 2021, 1.9 billion unique monthly users worldwide. In Portugal, in February 2017, we acquired a 25% stake in the capital of sports broadcaster SPORT TV. We have invested in high quality cable and fiber-based network infrastructure which allows us to offer advanced multi-play and high bandwidth services in a vast majority of our service areas. Our fixed-line services in Portugal are primarily delivered over FTTH, DSL and DTH, in Israel are primarily delivered over HFC cables (and since April 2021, fiber-based internet services are also delivered over IBC Israel’s fiber optic network in certain areas where the network had already been deployed) and in the Dominican Republic are delivered over both HFC cable and FTTH, in each case that are among the most technically advanced in the markets in which we operate. Our cable networks enable us to offer download speeds of at least 200 Mbps to a majority of homes passed in our footprint in Israel and the Dominican Republic. We believe that our cable networks are well positioned for future technological developments, while the fiber networks in Portugal are already set up to provide download speeds of up to 1 Gbps. We are focused on increasing our investment in fiber in Portugal. We own 50.01% of FastFiber - Infraestruturas de Comunicaçã, S.A. (“FastFiber”) (formerly known as Altice Portugal FTTH), comprising all of our fiber assets in Portugal, including FTTH and dark fiber, which was created in April 2020 in partnership with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners. Through FastFiber, we rolled out over 388,000 new fiber homes passed in 2018, 356,000 new fiber homes passed in 2019, 603,000 new fiber homes passed in 2020 and a further 73,000 new fiber homes passed in the three months ended March 31, 2021. Throughout our geographies, we are working to expand our fiber network. In Israel, in February 2021, we acquired a 23.3% stake in IBC Israel Broadband Company (2013) Ltd. (“IBC Israel”). In Portugal and the Dominican Republic, we continue to upsell our fiber/cable based services to our existing DSL subscriber base. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, ----- without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, we generated residential fixed revenues of €631 million in Portugal, €563 million in Israel and €91 million in the Dominican Republic. We operate an extensive mobile network, which provides 4G coverage for 99.6% of the population of Portugal, 99.9% of the population of Israel and 97.5% of the population of the Dominican Republic, in each case, as of March 31, 2021. In addition, we have relationships with the industry’s significant mobile equipment providers and are able to offer customers top-of-the-market mobile equipment. In 2018, we completed the Towers Transactions, through which we monetized the value of our passive mobile infrastructure assets in Portugal and the Dominican Republic. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, we generated residential mobile revenues of €463 million in Portugal, €210 million in Israel and €263 million in the Dominican Republic. Further, we are in various stages of bidding for and investing in 5G spectrum in all jurisdictions in which we operate our mobile services. Following the completion of the 5G spectrum auction in Israel in August 2020, HOT along with Partner Communications Company Ltd. (“Partner”) was awarded two bands of 700 MHz (10 MHz each band), two bands of 2,600 MHz (20 MHz each band) and 10 bands of 3,500 MHz (10 MHz each band). After completion of the required preconditions, on September 29, 2020 the spectrums were allocated to HOT and HOT’s license was amended to allow the operation of 5G network. We launched 5G services in the first quarter of 2021 in certain areas in Israel. In Portugal, the 5G spectrum auction started on December 22, 2020 and the main auction is ongoing. The expected allocation of rights of use for frequencies is scheduled for the third quarter of 2021. In the Dominican Republic, the 5G spectrum auction started on February 9, 2021 and the auction is ongoing. The expected allocation of rights of use for frequencies is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect to participate in both of these auctions. In furtherance of our convergence strategy, we are focused on delivering high quality content offerings to complement our fixed and mobile services, including producing proprietary content, including live broadcasts of sports events and other sports- and lifestyle-related programs as well as the sports programming for which the Group has acquired broadcasting rights. For instance, this strategy is evidenced by our investment in SPORT TV for broadcasting premium sports content in Portugal. In July 2020, PT OpCo entered into a new distribution agreement with SPORT TV for a four-season period, pursuant to which PT Portugal committed to pay a noncontingent fixed price plus an additional variable fee component based on the number of subscribers and penetration rate. Between the end of 2015 and early 2016, we also entered into various agreements with other telecom operators and football clubs in Portugal to acquire reciprocal or exclusive broadcasting rights, including a sponsorship agreement with F.C. Porto. In Israel, we have entered into commitments to purchase content, mainly channels. We have also entered into various arrangements with Altice France Group’s Altice TV division, including non-exclusive distribution rights in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic of Netflix and Discovery channels. We intend to continue to selectively invest in local and value-added premium content as well as sports broadcasting and distribution rights in the future to differentiate our convergent communication services from those of our competitors. Through Teads, the digital advertising business acquired in 2017, we operate a leading, cloud-based, end-to-end technology platform that enables programmatic digital advertising for a global, curated ecosystem of quality advertisers and their agencies and quality publishers. Teads operates in the internet ecosystem (the “Open Web”) outside of advertising platforms, like Facebook and Google, which are known as the walled gardens (the “Walled",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,293,GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS AND THE OFFERING,293.2,"Gardens”). As an end-to-end solution, Teads’ platform consists of buy-side, sell-side, creative, data and artificial",293.2.1,,"intelligence optimization modules. As a result, Teads has built deep partnerships with both the demand and supply sides of digital advertising. For advertisers and their agencies, Teads’ platform offers a single access point to buy the inventory of many of the world’s best publishers. Through exclusive partnerships with these premium publishers, Teads enables customers to reach 1.9 billion unique monthly users (as of April 2021), while improving the efficiency, quality and cost of digital ad transactions. For approximately 3,100 publishers, Teads is a trusted monetization partner, providing the technology required to monetize their most valuable ad inventory programmatically. By connecting both sides through Teads’ integrated platform, known as the _Teads Global _Media Platform, Teads solves the digital programmatic advertising industry’s most significant problems related_ to value chain fragmentation, inefficient digital advertising pricing and quality and scale of inventory. Teads refers to the ecosystem enabled by Teads Global Media Platform as the curated internet (the “Curated Internet”). For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, we generated revenues from Teads of €488 million. For more information, see “Description of Our Business—Other Services— _Media”._ ----- For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, the Group generated total consolidated revenues of €4,088 million, of which, without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, €2,148 million, €981 million, €475 million and €488 million was contributed by our Portugal, Israel, Dominican Republic and Teads segments, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of €1,575 million, of which, without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, €828 million, €343 million, €233 million and €177 million was contributed by our Portugal, Israel, Dominican Republic and Teads segments, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

We are located in markets that we believe have a number of attractive trends for cable and mobile operators. Portugal is our largest geography by revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. In Portugal, we benefit from PT Portugal’s number one market positions in ----- broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and enterprise telecommunications services and number two market position in pay TV, which we provide through FastFiber’s fiber network that passed 5,699,000 homes as of March 31, 2021 (including homes accessed through wholesale fiber operators) as well as through DSL and DTH networks. We are also the largest mobile operator in Portugal. PT Portugal’s mobile network is 4G-LTE enabled, allowing speeds of up to 400 Mbps and reaching 99.6% of the population, as of March 31, 2021. In Israel, we are the leading fiber/cable operator with the number one market position in pay TV and number two market position in broadband internet. We benefit from nationwide fiber/cable network coverage, a unique feature in the cable sector, which we believe provides us with significant penetration upside potential. Further, in February 2021, HOT became an equal partner in IBC Partnership, an entity that holds 70% of IBC Israel’s share capital, together with Cellcom and Israel Infrastructure Fund, and now HOT indirectly holds 23.3% of IBC Israel’s share capital, through an investment of €45 million.

As of April 2021, we offer fiber-based internet services in speeds of up to 1 Gbps over IBC Israel’s fiber optic network in certain areas where the network had already been deployed. Portugal and Israel have historically had high consumption of fixed and mobile services and we believe that we are well positioned to meet the growing demand for bandwidth-intensive services and premium content offerings in the future. The combination of our very-high-speed fiber/cable networks and our 4G and, in Israel, also 5G, networks enables us to offer attractive flat rate multi-play packages to meet the growing demand for speed and bandwidth coming from multi-screen households, for usage both in and outside the home.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Our fixedline services in Portugal are primarily delivered over proprietary FTTH, DSL and DTH, and in Israel are primarily delivered over our proprietary HFC network (and since April 2021, fiber-based internet services are also delivered over IBC Israel’s fiber optic network in certain areas where the network had already been deployed), in each case that are among the most technically advanced in the markets in which we operate. In Portugal, we own 50.01% of FastFiber which in turn owns the largest fiber network in Portugal by penetration that passed 5,699,000 homes as of March 31, 2021 (including homes accessed through wholesale fiber operators). Pursuant to our fiber rollout strategy in Portugal, through FastFiber we rolled out 388,000 new fiber homes passed in 2018, 356,000 new fiber homes passed in 2019, 603,000 new fiber homes passed in 2020 and a further 73,000 fiber homes passed in the three months ended March 31, 2021. FastFiber connected more than 26,000 and 8,000 additional kilometers of dark fiber network in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and in the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. We believe our state-of-the-art networks allow us to offer attractive and competitive services in terms of picture quality, speed and connection reliability. We are able to offer download speeds of at least 200 Mbps to a majority of homes passed in our footprint in Israel and the Dominican Republic. Given the existing technological capability of our networks, we have been offering download speeds of up to 300 Mbps and 400 Mbps in the Dominican Republic and Portugal, respectively, and with limited network, expect to offer download speeds of up to 500 Mbps in Israel, in each case, in certain areas covered by our network. We believe that with our fiber/cable technologies we are well positioned to meet the anticipated high bandwidth and speed requirements of our customers. We are also the largest mobile operator in Portugal, with a market-leading 4G-LTE enabled mobile network capable of delivering download speeds of up to 400 Mbps and reaching 99.6% of the population. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, we incurred Capital Expenditures (Accrued) of €846 million, which includes network-related capital expenditures to improve our 4G and 5G (in the case of Israel) networks and continued fiber deployment as well as customer related capital expenditures. We believe our high level of prior investment and ownership of fiber and cable assets provides us with a greater ability to control costs compared to our alternative operator competitors, determine the most accurate incremental capital expenditures and generate higher margins. We have also capitalized on our passive mobile infrastructure in Portugal and the Dominican Republic by consummating the Towers Transactions.

We believe that the strength of our fixed and mobile businesses, and our ability to complement these services with premium content offerings, provide an opportunity to increase the penetration of our multi-play and premium packages. The demand for high-speed internet, fixed mobile convergence and high-quality content are key drivers of our cross-sell and up-sell strategy. We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend as our network has been built and upgraded specifically to address the increasing speed and bandwidth requirements of our subscribers. We also continue to offer our existing DSL subscribers the option to subscribe to a fiber/cable offering, which provides an opportunity to significantly grow penetration on our network and to create upselling opportunities. Migrating existing DSL subscribers to our fiber/cable network also reduces the costs associated with renting the last mile and enables funds to be reallocated to accelerate the rollout of our fiber/cable network. We offer a fully integrated fixed and mobile business in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic. In Portugal, we have successfully capitalized on cross-selling opportunities through delivery of connected services and we believe that we are well positioned to benefit further from convergence between fixed and mobile service offerings by leveraging our high-speed fiber-based fixed network and 4G mobile network. We operate 3G, 4G, and 5G (in the case of Israel) mobile networks in Israel and the Dominican Republic, which, in each case, benefit from synergies with our cable networks. We are also focused on delivering high quality content offerings to complement our fixed and mobile services, including producing proprietary content. For example, in Portugal, we offer a high-quality content package through more than 200 channels, most of which are offered in full HD 1080p resolution, and a leading VoD library, and own a 25% stake in SPORT TV, a sports broadcaster. Between the end of 2015 and early 2016, we entered into various agreements with other telecom operators and football clubs in Portugal to acquire reciprocal or exclusive broadcasting rights, including exclusive broadcasting rights to the F.C. Porto matches in the Portuguese Premier League. In November 2018, we launched a new MEO Series service aimed at broadcasting exclusive and other important series. Throughout the years 2017 and 2018, we added new channels to our portfolio, some of which are provided exclusively by us. In 2020, MEO was one of the few operators to have launched TV services in Apple TV and Android TV OTT SetTop boxes, providing a unique user interface, while maintaining appreciated features like Fast Zapping and personalized services like Continue Watching. In Israel, we co-develop and co-own high-quality original local content together with local producers and broadcast it on our proprietary channels, which supplements other third party content and channels that we broadcast on our network. We have also entered into various arrangements with Altice France Group’s Altice TV division, including non-exclusive distribution rights in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic of Netflix and Discovery channels.

The increase in the Group’s revenue was mainly driven by revenue increases in Portugal and Teads. For the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020, the Group’s revenue in Portugal increased in a range of 9.1% to 11.4%, from €499 million (for the three months ended June 30, 2020) to between €545 million and €556 million. This was supported by service revenue growth in the residential segment. As expected, roaming revenue increased year over year in both the residential and B2B segments, given the very low level of roaming in the second quarter of 2020. The Group’s revenue in Israel decreased between 2.9% and 0.9% in the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020. In addition, revenue for the Dominican Republic increased in the range of 1.2% to 3.2%.

The increase in the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA was mainly driven by Adjusted EBITDA increases in Portugal and Teads. Portugal EBITDA increased between 4.8% and 6.9%, driven by the increase in revenues year over year in both the residential and business segments and cost control. Teads EBITDA increased by a range of 104.3% to 108.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020. Based on preliminary results, the Group’s Capital Expenditures (Accrued) for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was between €205 million and €209 million, an increase between 0.2% and 2.2% compared to €204 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. As a consequence, the Operating Free Cash Flow for the three months ended June 30, 2021, grew, by a range of 10.0% to 12.3%, to between €191 million and €195 million, compared to €174 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020.

Excluding such items enables trends in the Group’s operating results and cash flow generation to be more easily observable. The Non-IFRS Measures are used by the Group internally to manage and assess the results of its operations, make decisions with respect to investments and allocation of resources, and assess the performance of management personnel. Such performance measures are also the de facto metrics used by investors and other members of the financial community to value other companies operating in the same industry as the Group and thus are a basis for comparability between the Group and its peers. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating profit as the effects of depreciation, amortization and ----- impairment excluded from this measure do ultimately affect the operating results, which is also presented within the annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 1 (Presentation of Financial Statements).",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

We cannot provide any assurance that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt obligations when due. Our ability to generate cash flow and to fund our capital expenditures, ongoing operations and debt service obligations is dependent on many factors, including: - our future operating performance; - the demand and price levels for our current and planned products and services; - our ability to maintain the level of technical capacity required on our networks and in the subscriber equipment and other relevant equipment connected to our networks; - our ability to successfully introduce new products and services; - our ability to reduce the churn rate; - general economic conditions and other conditions affecting consumer spending; - competition; - sufficient distributable reserves, as required under applicable law; - the outcome of certain litigation/disputes in which we are involved; and - legal, tax and regulatory developments affecting our business. Some of these factors are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we might not be able to repay our debt, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, including capital expenditures. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations, we might have to sell assets, attempt to restructure or refinance our existing debt or seek additional funding in the form of debt or equity capital. We may not be able to do so on satisfactory terms, if at all. We expect that a portion of our cash flow will consist of payments of dividends or interest by Israeli companies in our Group. In general, payments of dividends or interest by companies that are Israeli residents for tax purposes are subject to withholding tax. With respect to payments to Luxembourg tax residents or residents of other countries which have a tax treaty with Israel, such withholding tax may be reduced from the rates generally applicable under Israeli law to the rates applicable under the tax treaty between Israel and Luxembourg or the other applicable treaty. In order to enjoy the reduced rate of withholding tax, it is necessary to file with the Israel Tax Authority, a request for relief from withholding prior to payment of the dividend and/or interest. If a withholding tax exemption or relief certificate is received from the Israel Tax Authority prior to the payment of the dividend and/or interest, the payer will be able to make the dividend/interest payment at such reduced withholding tax rate. However, if such request is denied or delayed and such certificate is not available at the time of payment, withholding will be made at the full statutory rates. Any changes in the tax rates on dividends or interest could significantly affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations under the Notes. In addition, payments of dividends by companies resident or not in the Dominican Republic as well as payment of interests paid to non-resident companies are subject to a withholding tax of 10%. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

These covenants restrict, or will restrict, our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to, among other things: - pay dividends or make other distributions; - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures; - engage in transactions with affiliates and other related parties; - dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; - merge with other companies; - incur additional debt and grant guarantees; - repurchase or redeem equity interests and subordinated debt or issue shares of subsidiaries; and - grant liens and pledge assets. All of these limitations are, or will be, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, including the ability to pay dividends, make investments or to make significant prepayments of shareholder debt.

Our ability to meet these leverage ratios may be affected by events beyond our control and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these ratios. In addition to limiting our flexibility in operating our business, the breach of any covenants or obligations under the agreements and instruments governing our debt may result in a default under the applicable debt agreement or instrument and could trigger the acceleration of related debt, which in turn could trigger defaults under agreements governing our other debt.

Shifts in such rates may adversely affect our debt service obligations.,"We are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Altice Financing Term Loans, Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities and Altice Financing Guarantee Facilities. In addition, any additional amounts we borrow under certain revolving credit facilities will bear interest at a floating rate. See “Description _of Other Indebtedness”. An increase in the interest rates on our debt will reduce the funds available to repay our_ debt and to finance our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities. Although we enter into various derivative transactions to manage our exposure to movements in interest rates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost. There can be no guarantee that our hedging strategies will adequately protect us from the effects of interest rate fluctuation, or that these hedges will not limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in interest rates. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the EU are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that certain LIBOR settings will permanently cease immediately after December 31, 2021 or after June 30, 2023, as applicable (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the FCA will no longer require any panel banks to continue to submit LIBOR beyond the date from which the panel banks have notified their departure, or to require the ICE Benchmark Association to continue to publish LIBOR on the basis of panel banks submissions beyond such dates. It follows that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after the dates set out in the FCA Announcement. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association further announced on March 5, 2021 that the FCA Announcement constitutes an index cessation event under the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement and the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol for all LIBOR settings. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including, but not limited to, the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities, the Altice Financing Term Loans and/or and Altice Financing Guarantee Facilities having interest rates that are linked to LIBOR or EURIBOR, as applicable). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile,13.1.6,Changes or uncertainty in respect of LIBOR may affect our sources of funding.,"Some of our sources of funding are linked to LIBOR. Various interest rate benchmarks (including LIBOR) are the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, as amended). In addition, the FCA Announcement indicates that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021 or June 30, 2023, as applicable. On November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the Working Group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of term SONIA reference rates. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, investors should in particular be aware that: ----- - any of the reforms or pressures described above or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark (including LIBOR) could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be; and - from the cessation date of LIBOR, the rate of interest applicable to our sources of funding may be determined for a period by applicable fall-back provisions, although such provisions, often being dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations for the LIBOR rate, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time) and may in certain circumstances result in the effective application of a fixed rate based on the rate which applied in the previous period when LIBOR was available. More generally, any of the above matters or any other significant change to the setting or existence of LIBOR could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our sources of funding and/or could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of, and the amount payable under, our sources of funding. Changes in the manner of administration of LIBOR could result in adjustments to the conditions applicable to our sources of funding or other consequences relevant to our sources of funding. No assurance can be provided that changes will not be made to LIBOR or any other relevant benchmark rate and/or that such benchmarks will continue to exist.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile,13.1.7,Currency fluctuations and interest rate and other hedging risks could adversely affect our financial results.,"Our business is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. HOT’s primary transactional currency is the NIS. The primary transactional currency of PT Portugal and its subsidiaries is the euro. The primary transactional currency of Altice Dominicana is DOP. The primary transactional currency of Teads is the local currency of the relevant jurisdiction. As a result, our reported results of operations can be significantly different compared to the results of our businesses, particularly in Israel and the Dominican Republic on a local currency basis. We conduct, and will continue to conduct, transactions in currencies other than such primary transactional currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar. Our existing debt is primarily denominated in U.S. dollar, euro and NIS although the amounts incurred in euros and NIS do not necessarily match the cash flows generated from operations in such currencies. The exchange rate between U.S. dollars and NIS, the U.S dollars and euro and U.S. dollars and DOP, which affect our operations, and the euro and NIS and euro and DOP, which affect the translation risk relating to the consolidation of our financial statements, has been volatile in the past and may continue to be so in the future. Moreover, the government of the Dominican Republic has imposed exchange controls and currency restrictions in the past and may do so in the future. This is beyond our control and may result in the DOP ceasing to be freely convertible or transferable abroad to service our then outstanding indebtedness or otherwise, or the DOP being significantly depreciated relative to other currencies, including the U.S. dollar, which may impede our ability to service our outstanding obligations and affect our earnings and cash flow. We have historically covered a portion of our U.S. dollar and euro cash outflows arising on anticipated and committed obligations through the use of foreign exchange derivative instruments. Further, while we manage the risk of certain currency fluctuations in respect of a portion of our existing debt and to hedge some of our exposure to interest rate changes in respect of indebtedness linked to interest rates, these arrangements may be costly and may not insulate us completely from such exposure. There can be no guarantee that our hedging strategies will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuation or changes in interest rates, or that these hedges will not limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in exchange rates or interest rates.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile,13.1.8,Negative changes in our credit rating and future ratings downgrades of sovereign debt may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.,"One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of such Notes. A downgrade in our credit rating may negatively affect our ability to obtain future financing to fund our operations and capital needs, which may affect our liquidity. It may also increase our financing costs by increasing the interest rates of our outstanding debt or the interest rates at which we are able to refinance existing debt or incur additional ----- debt. In December 2018, the corporate family ratings of Altice International were downgraded by Moody’s from B1 to B2. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the corporate family ratings of Altice International remain at B2 with Moody’s and B with Standard & Poor. There can be no assurance that the Group’s corporate rating, or the instrument rating with respect to the Notes, will be maintained at existing levels. See “Risks Relating to the _Notes and the Structure—Credit ratings may not reflect all risks”._ Our credit rating may be impacted by a number of factors, including the effects of the economic conditions in the countries in which we operate and any future rating downgrades of the sovereign debt of these countries. For example, against the backdrop of the Eurozone crisis, Portuguese sovereign debt was consecutively downgraded by the rating agencies. Because the financial condition, revenues and profitability of our operating subsidiaries are closely linked to the economies of their countries of operations, we expect that the Group as a whole will also be impacted by any downgrading in the sovereign debt rating of such countries. Any deterioration in the economic condition of the other countries in which we operate or any ratings downgrade of sovereign debt of these countries may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,"Risks Relating to Our Business, Technology and Competition",13.2.1,We face significant competition in each of the industries in which we operate and competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business.,"We face significant competition from market incumbents and new competitors in each of our operating segments and operational activities. The nature and level of the competition that we face varies in each operating segment and for each of the products and services that we offer. For our fixed-based services, our competitors include, but are not limited to, providers of television, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and business services using DSL or fiber connections, providers of television services using technologies such as IPTV and satellite, DTT providers, mobile network operators, providers of emerging digital entertainment technologies and other providers of wholesale carrier, infrastructure and white label services. For our mobile services we face competition from other mobile operators who own and operate a mobile network as well as from providers of VoIP and MVNOs. For our wholesale services our key competitors include, but are not limited to, wholesale providers of voice, data and fiber services. In some instances, our competitors may have easier access to financing, more comprehensive product ranges, lower financial leverage, greater financial, technical, marketing and personnel resources, larger subscriber bases, wider geographical coverage for their fixed or mobile networks, greater brand name recognition and experience or longer established relationships with regulatory authorities, suppliers and customers. Some of our competitors may have fewer regulatory burdens with which they are required to comply because, among other reasons, they use different technologies to provide their services, do not own their own fixed-line network, or are not subject to obligations applicable to operators with significant market power. There has been a trend of consolidation of telecommunications operations in certain of the countries in which we operate. Mergers, joint ventures and alliances among franchised, wireless or private cable operators, satellite providers, local exchange carriers and other telecommunication service providers in the jurisdictions in which we operate may provide additional benefits to some of our competitors, for example via access to financing, resources, efficiencies of scale or the ability to provide multiple services in direct competition with us. Public-private joint ventures may also increase competition. In relation to the Teads segment, some advertisers and agencies have their own relationships with publishers or are seeking to establish such relationships, and may choose to buy advertising inventory directly from them rather than leverage all the capabilities of our platform. As a consequence of the telecommunications and mobile markets reaching saturation in certain geographies where we operate, there are a limited number of new subscribers entering the market and therefore in order to increase our subscriber base and market share, we are dependent on attracting our competitors’ existing subscribers, which intensifies the competitive pressures that we are subject to. Moreover, the competitive landscape in our operating segments is generally characterized by increasing competition, tiered offerings that include lower priced entrylevel products and a focus on multi-play offerings, including special promotions and discounts for customers who subscribe for multi-play services. We expect additional competitive pressure from media and telecommunications industries that seek to offer packages of fixed-based and mobile voice, internet and video broadcast services. In addition, we expect competition to increase as a result of changes to the regulatory regimes in the markets in ----- which we operate, such as those attempting to increase competition by allowing third party access to cable networks on a wholesale basis. The telecommunications services industry has undergone significant technological development over time and these changes continue to affect our business. Such changes have had, and will continue to have, a profound impact on consumer expectations and behavior. Our products and services are also subject to increasing competition from alternative new technologies or improvements in existing technologies. For example, our pay TV services in certain jurisdictions compete with IPTV service providers in our network areas utilizing DSL or VDSL broadband internet connections. In the broadband internet market, we face competition from mobile operators that are increasingly utilizing a combination of progressively powerful handsets and high bandwidth technologies, such as universal mobile telecommunications system (“UMTS”) and LTE technology. Mobile services providers, including those offering advanced, high speed, high bandwidth technologies and MVNOs also contribute to the competitive pressures that we face in our fixed-based telephony business. In the past, mobile operators have engaged in ‘cord-cutting’ campaigns and have used attractive mobile calling tariffs to encourage customers with both fixed-line and mobile services to retain only their mobile services. This substitution, in addition to the increasing use of alternative communications technologies, negatively affects our fixed-line call usage volumes and subscriber growth. At the same time, incumbent fixed-line operators have also applied resources to ‘win back’ activities that can entice our existing telephony customers, as well as prospective telephony customers, to return or remain with the incumbent by offering certain economic incentives. The Group’s products and services are also subject to increasing competition from alternative new technologies or improvements in existing technologies. New players from sectors that are either unregulated or subject to different regulations (including internet players such as Yahoo!, Google, Disney+, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, YouTube, Netflix and other audiovisual players, media players and “over the top” (“OTT”) (of an existing broadband internet network) players) have also emerged as competitors to our video content offering. These players are taking advantage of improved connectivity and platform agnostic technologies to offer OTT and cloudbased services. Telecommunications operators are expected to maintain traditional access services and billing relationships over which users access services from adjacent players such as well-known companies offering music, video, photos, apps and retail. The rapid success of audio-visual content streamed through the telecommunications network and insufficient innovation could lead to the emergence of other content or service providers as well as the saturation of the market, which would put pressure on the revenues and margins of operators like us, while simultaneously requiring us to increase capital expenditures to remain competitive, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we are also facing competition from non-traditional mobile voice and data services based on new mobile internet technologies, in particular OTT applications, such as Skype, Google Talk, FaceTime, Viber and WhatsApp. These OTT applications are often free of charge, accessible via smartphones and allow their users to have access to potentially unlimited messaging and voice services over the internet, thus bypassing more expensive traditional voice and messaging services, such as SMS and MMS, provided by mobile network operators who are only able to charge the internet data usage for such services. All telecommunications operators are currently competing with OTT service providers who leverage existing infrastructures and operate capitallight business models, enhancing their ability to compete with businesses, such as ours, which operate capitalintensive business models. OTT service providers have over the past years become more sophisticated and technological developments have led to a significant improvement in the quality of service, particularly in speech quality. In addition, players with strong brand capability and financial strength, such as Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, have turned their attention to the provision of OTT audio and data services. In the long term, if non-traditional mobile voice and data services or similar services continue to increase in popularity and if we, or more generally all of the telecommunications operators, are not able to address this competition, this could cause declines in subscriber base and profitability across all of our products and services, among other material adverse effects. In addition, we may face increasing competition from the large-scale roll-out of public WiFi networks by local governments and utilities and transportation service providers, new and existing WiFi telecommunications operators and others, which particularly benefits OTT service providers. Due to their ability to leverage the existing infrastructure and to roll out public WiFi in a cost-efficient way, our competitors may be better positioned to offer their customers public WiFi access at attractive terms and conditions or as part of their current mobile and landline offerings, which may affect our ability to retain or acquire customers. Furthermore, our competitors may realize cost savings by off-loading mobile data traffic onto their own WiFi networks or those of their partners in order to reduce costs and increase bandwidth more quickly or efficiently than we can. An increase in public WiFi networks could also cause declines in profitability as demand for our network and services decreases. ----- The following is an overview of the competitive landscape in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic: _Portugal_ In Portugal, we have experienced pressure from our competitors to reduce monthly subscription fees. The competitive landscape has changed significantly as a result of the merger in 2013 of ZON Multimédia—Serviços de Telecomunicações e Multimédia, SGPS, S.A. (“ZON”), the largest cable operator at that time, and Optimus SGPS, S.A. (“Optimus”), the third largest mobile operator at that time, to create NOS SGPS, S.A. (“NOS”), an integrated telecommunications operator in Portugal. We also face competition from Cabovisão (now Nowo), which we disposed of in January 2016, under its new ownership. In the broadband and mobile market, we face competition from Vodafone, NOS and Nowo, the latter operating through a MVNO with MEO. In the fixed telephony market, PT Portugal has experienced, and may continue to experience, erosion of market share of both access lines and of outgoing domestic and international traffic as result of the trend toward the use of mobile services instead of fixed telephone services. Additionally, all mobile players have launched fixed telephony services based on their mobile networks, which are directly competing for the same customers. Competition is intensified by mobile operators NOS and Vodafone with large mobile operations, particularly in light of their partnership relating to the reciprocal sharing of fiber and mobile towers across Portugal. The new network sharing agreement between NOS and Vodafone took effect from the beginning of 2018 and contemplates the development and sharing of dark fiber in fixed infrastructure at a national level. This agreement was subsequently extended to the mobile infrastructure, covering mobile networks. These and such similar other developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Mobile operators can bypass PT Portugal’s international wireline network by interconnecting directly with fixed-line and mobile networks either in its domestic network or abroad. Through FastFiber, the Portuguese operation continues expanding its proprietary fixed fiber infrastructure and rollout of FTTH, competing with Vodafone and NOS. In the business services market, competitors such as Vodafone and NOS are taking market share from MEO in traditional connectivity services, partly offset by MEO introducing new ICT services to its business customers. Competition is also forcing down the prices of fixed-line voice services for long distance and international calls, as operators have been offering unlimited voice communications for all national and several international fixed destinations. Lowering international call prices has caused a decline in PT Portugal’s revenues from international fixed-line voice services. We expect competition from operators with services based on VoIP to also place increasing price pressure on voice tariffs. In addition, ANACOM (The Autoridade Nacional de Comunicações, the Portuguese telecommunications regulator) has in recent years approved significant reductions in fixed and mobile termination fees, as well as the prices charged by PT Portugal for leasing out its Continent-Azores-Madeira (“CAM”) lines and ethernet circuits. These factors have significantly affected PT Portugal’s overall revenues, and we expect these factors to continue to negatively affect revenues in the future. _Israel_ In Israel, in the multi-channel television market, our main competitor is D.B.S. Satellite Services (1998) Ltd, a subsidiary of Bezeq, which provides satellite technology based multi-channel television services under the brand “YES”. Cellcom Israel Ltd. (“Cellcom”) and Partner Communications Company Ltd. (“Partner”) also provide broadcasting offers to subscribers over the internet (OTT). Other factors that have a material impact on competition in the market include the availability of free-to-air DTT channels and the increasing availability of video content and services that may be offered via the internet. In addition, we believe that the implementation of certain regulatory changes may have an impact on competition in the market, including the expansion in the number of free-to-air DTT channels, the ‘narrow’ television package and the increased scope of special broadcasting licenses pursuant to which we are required to broadcast television channels owned by special broadcasting license holders on our network under certain terms. In the broadband market, we compete primarily with Bezeq, which provides high speed broadband Internet access over DSL, holds the highest market share in broadband Internet infrastructure access in Israel, and offers a range of products with different download speeds, data transfer limits and other value added services. Continued upgrades to the quality of Bezeq’s DSL based broadband internet infrastructure access service to VDSL and potentially even faster DSL variants and the possibility of widespread FTTX installations which it launched in March 2021, could have a negative impact on our competitive position in the broadband internet infrastructure market and may also require us to revise our marketing strategy and make potentially significant capital expenditures. The regulatory changes since 2015, requiring Bezeq and HOT to provide certain wholesale services to service providers with a view to create a market for broadband infrastructure access and fixed telephony services, has also resulted in increased competition from other service providers such as ISPs and IPTV providers who ----- utilize our cable networks to provide internet services. These and such similar other regulatory changes may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition had also increased following the creation of a public-private joint venture in June 2013 between the government owned Israeli Electric Company (“IEC”) and private owners which established IBC Israel, which use IEC’s passive physical infrastructure in Israel to provide wholesale products to telecommunication services providers via an optical fiber network, and thus competed with HOT and Bezeq in the wholesale market as well as providing such services directly to large business customers. In June 2019, the Israeli Ministry of Communications approved a merger between IBC Israel, and Cellcom and Israel Infrastructure Fund, further to approving a significant decrease in IBC Israel’s deployment obligations. In February 2021, HOT acquired an indirect stake of approximately 23.3% in IBC Israel, through its holdings in the partnership, similar to Cellcom and Israel Infrastructure Fund’s share holding in IBC Israel. IEC continues to hold 30% of IBC Israel’s shares. As an integral part of the transaction, HOT entered into an agreement for the purchase of indefeasible rights of use (IRU) in infrastructure lines in IBC Israel, according to certain committed gradual increases in the percentage of the customers’ houses connected to IBC Israel’s network. As of April 2021, HOT offers fiber-based internet services over IBC Israel’s fiber optic network in certain areas where the network had already been deployed. In addition to Cellcom and IBC Israel, Partner is also deploying an optical fiber based network in several areas. In December 2018, the Israeli Ministry of Communications published a public hearing regarding the proposed regulatory principles for the policy regarding the deployment of ultra broadband infrastructure in Israel in order to create a competitive environment and establish rules that will promote the deployment of fiber optic networks in Israel. Pursuant to the hearings and recommendations of a public committee appointed for this purpose, the Israeli government approved the policy regarding fiber optic deployment in Israel in September 2020, followed by an amendment to the Israeli Communication Law in December 2020. According to such policy, Bezeq is required to notify to the Israeli Ministry of Communications of the areas in which it plans to deploy fiber and is under an obligation to complete the deployment according to a timeline provided in its license. In order to also promote the deployment of advanced network in peripheral areas, a national fund will be established to conduct bid procedures for the deployment in such areas. The fund will be financed by all the telecommunication operators (including Bezeq) which will be obligated to pay 0.5% of their respective annual income to the fund, with the deduction of interconnect fees. Bezeq will not be entitled to participate in the bids. Competition in providing fixed-line telephony service is intense and is expected to increase as a result of the creation of the wholesale market with providers having introduced substantial price reductions over the past few years. Bezeq, our principal competitor in the Israeli market and the largest provider of fixed-line telephony services, has an extensive fixed-line telephone network throughout Israel, strong market knowledge, high brand recognition and substantial capital resources. Other competitors provide fixed-line telephony services over broadband (“VoB”), among them Cellcom and Partner. In Israel, our mobile service, HOT Mobile, competes with several mobile network operators, including Cellcom, Partner, Golan Telecom and Bezeq, who between them are estimated to directly represent approximately 95% of the total market for mobile services in Israel as of March 31, 2021 by number of mobile customers. The telecom market in Israel has changed significantly in recent years to become more fragmented, including nine players in the mobile market, underlying an increase of competition. The principal mobile operators in Israel benefit from strong brand recognition. In July 2019, the Israeli Ministry of Communications published a national bid for the allocation of 5G frequencies. HOT Mobile and Partner submitted a joint proposal. Following the bid, each leading mobile operator won certain frequency bands which allow them to provide 5G mobile cellular services. After the completion of the allocation in September 2020, HOT launched 5G services in the first quarter of 2021 in certain areas in Israel. Competition in the provision of internet, data and voice products to business customers is intense, with Bezeq, several local telephony operators through VoB and several international telephony operators among our competitors. In addition to competitive activity, we continue to see challenges in this segment of the market as a result of price erosion in existing products and the need to invest in new product development to satisfy the evolving preferences of prospective customers. _Dominican Republic_ We face significant competition from market incumbents, including Claro which has the largest market share in each of the residential mobile, residential fixed and business services segments, and other small competitors. For our fixed-based services, our competitors include local players such as Viva and Aster and also include, but are not limited to, providers of television, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and business services using xDSL ----- or fiber connections, providers of TV services using technologies such as IPTV and satellite, DTT providers, mobile network operators providing fixed wireless broadband access services, providers of emerging digital entertainment technologies, mobile voice and other providers of wholesale services. In the mobile market, Altice Dominicana mainly competes with Claro (with which it shares a comparable spectrum range and 4G-LTE population coverage), and with Viva in the low-end segment. We also face competition from other mobile operators who own and operate a mobile network as well as from providers of VoIP. Altice Dominicana also competes with niche players Wind and Sky. In the pay-TV segment, the market is still deeply fragmented with several regional cable operators. For our wholesale services our key competitors include, but are not limited to, wholesale providers of voice, data and fiber services. The competitive landscape in the Dominican Republic is generally characterized by increasing competition, tiered offerings that include lower priced entry-level products and in the fixed-line segment, a focus on multi-play offerings, including special promotions and discounts for customers who subscribe for multi-play services. We expect additional competitive pressure from media and telecommunications industries that seek to offer packages of fixed-based and mobile voice, internet and video broadcast services. In addition, we expect competition to increase as a result of changes to the regulatory regimes in the Dominican Republic, such as those attempting to increase competition by allowing third party access to fixed networks that are considered an essential facility and the obligation to share access to passive elements of mobile networks with other operators. With respect to the Teads segment, we face competition from various market participants, including the Walled Gardens such as Google and Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, Snap, Verizon, Iron Source, Xandr, Taboola, TripleLift, supply side platforms and demand side platforms. As we grow larger, we may face increased competition from the Walled Gardens should they choose to target our market share in the open internet as a growth opportunity. If the Walled Gardens begin to compete more directly with us in this manner, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows. We also face competitive risks in our relationship with publishers. Although we currently have exclusivity for outstream video with over 80% of approximately 3,100 of our publishers, header bidding opportunities (whereby a publisher may offer ad space to numerous outlets at once) may lead publishers to exit their exclusive arrangements with us. We also face competition from alternative service providers who are able to compete directly with us on placements and who can offer revenue guarantees that are competitive with ours. If our partnerships with publishers decline or become non-exclusive, customers may choose to work with our competitors. Further, we may in the future face competition from powerful publishers or alliances of publishers that compete directly with us by building their own technology or using a competitive technology to sell outstream videos on their own or in combination with one of our competitors. Our inability to compete successfully against companies that offer services similar to ours could result in increased customer churn, revenue loss, pressures on recruitment and retention of team members, service price reductions and increased research and development, marketing and promotional expenses or reduced operating margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows. Introduction of competent, competitive products, pricing strategies or other technologies by other competitors that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services could adversely affect our business.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,"Risks Relating to Our Business, Technology and Competition",13.2.2,The deployment of fiber optic networks and/or VDSL2 by our competitors could reduce and ultimately eliminate the gap between the speed and the power of our fiber optic/cable network compared to the DSL networks of our main competitors.,"We believe that one of our major competitive advantages is the power and speed of our fiber optic/cable network. However, certain of our competitors are deploying and expanding their fiber and/or VDSL2 networks enabling download speeds and bandwidths that could rival those reached by our network, and thus strongly reducing our competitive advantage. Furthermore, other operators may obtain access to the infrastructure deployed by an operator including certain of our fiber/cable networks, through joint projects or wholesale arrangements. For instance, in Israel, IBC Israel operates on a wholesale model and several suppliers were already engaged with it, including Cellcom, to provide fiber-based services using IBC Israel’s fiber optic network. In general, Portugal is a mature market with respect to fiber deployment. As of March 31, 2021, the total number of marketable homes in Portugal is approximately 7.2 million, with MEO’s proprietary homes passed at 4.7 million and Vodafone’s self-built homes at 3.4 million. NOS does not have significant proprietary fiber built, however, it is expanding its footprint and its fiber cable passes 4.9 million homes. The fiber market in Israel is not as mature and only Bezeq, IBC Israel and Partner are currently deploying fiber. With the total addressable homes ----- being 2.5 million as of March 31, 2021, the homes passed for Bezeq is 1.5 million, for IBC Israel is 0.5 million and for Partner is 0.75 million. Through IBC Israel, HOT is targeting to expand its fiber footprint to approximately 1.7 million households in Israel in the next five years and Bezeq has indicated that 250,000 homes (10% of the total addressable homes in Israel) are ready to be connected, with the objective of reaching 1 million homes by the end of 2021 (40% of total addressable homes). This pace of deployment is significantly higher than the previous guidance consisting of reaching 50% of homes within four to five years. On March 14, 2021, Bezeq launched its fiber commercial offering, following several years of negotiations with the regulators. This fiber launch will potentially upsell a sizable chunk of its existing DSL subscribers thereby providing revenue tailwinds. Bezeq faces competition from Cellcom and Partner, which jointly have approximately 10% market share for their fiber offerings, with a large and growing addressable market. Further, in the Dominican Republic, Empresa de Transmision Electrica Dominicana (“ETED Dominicana”) has launched the National Fiber Optic Network Backbone, a project pursuant to which its transmission facilities connecting multiple electrical nodes creates a reliable optic transport. ETED Dominicana has also installed a cabinet where local operators can perform a local loop connection to serve their customers or branches. Currently the coverage is in certain provinces, including the Gran Santo Domingo area, Santiago, San Pedro de Macoris and San Cristobal. ETED Dominicana provides connectivity for certain governmental agencies (including the police and national electricity companies). Pursuant to a permit concession granted by Indotel, ETED Dominicana may sell its services to local operators only, such as Claro, Altice Dominicana, Wind or local cable operators, and may no longer offer its services to end customers. This could result in increasing price pressure on our operations in the Dominican Republic. If our competitors continue to deploy or significantly increase their access to fiber optic networks they could compete with us in terms of the offering of high-speed internet and television services of a quality and speed greater than or equal to ours, thus potentially eliminating our current competitive advantage, increasing the pressure upon prices and margins and leading us to make significant investments in order to match the services they offer.

These cookies are used to track a user for targeting purposes and measure performance of digital advertising campaigns without collecting nor processing personally identifiable information. This shift by internet browsers stems from pressure from consumers and regulators to ensure the industry is respecting user privacy as some consumers and regulators deemed cookies to be impacting consumer privacy. This decline in the use of thirdparty cookies limits advertising technology companies’ ability to track and target users, potentially resulting in advertising campaigns being less effective. Though we have developed our own cookie-less alternatives, there is no guarantee that advertisers will find our alternative solutions to be effective, and the perception that our or other solutions are not effective may cause advertisers to shift more spend away from the open internet and towards Walled Gardens such as Facebook and Google, which do not rely as much on cookies and are able to use loggedin user data for targeting and tracking purposes. Further, with respect to the Teads segment, the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including price competition, our ability to accurately estimate revenues from customer engagements, our ability to estimate resources and other costs for long-term pricing and cash flows for long-term contracts, our customers’ perceptions of our ability to add value through our services, introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors and general economic and political conditions. In addition, privacy regulations may further restrict customers’ ability to run targeted advertising campaigns, which will lead to pricing decline since customers will want to pay less for less targeted advertising. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video, sports and other content. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the content market. The ability of customers to obtain high quality content may lead to a decline in our pay television business. Traditional providers of content, including broadcasters, as well as internet based e-commerce or content providers are increasing their internet-based offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market, or existing providers may adjust their services, with unique offerings or approaches to providing content. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition of virtually all content being offered for free to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth.

If competitors introduce lower cost or differentiated offerings that compete with or are perceived to compete with Teads’, our ability to grow the Teads business with new or existing customers could be impaired. It is possible that we may reach a point of saturation from which we cannot continue to grow our revenue because of internal limits that advertisers may place on the allocation of their advertising budgets for digital media to a particular provider or otherwise. Teads customers typically have relationships with different providers and there is limited cost to moving budgets to Teads’ competitors. As a result, we may have limited visibility as to our future revenue streams. We cannot assure you that Teads customers will continue to use our platform or that we will be able to replace, in a timely or effective manner, departing customers with new customers and publishers that generate comparable revenue. On the supply side, Teads is subject to the economic health and evolving business strategies of its publisher partners. Teads depends upon publishers to provide advertising space which it can offer to existing and prospective advertisers and agencies. While Teads has established exclusivity for outstream video with 80% of approximately 3,100 of our publisher partners, and has experienced a Publisher Retention Rate (defined as the number of our top 500 publishers retained from the prior period end) of approximately 99% in the year ended December 31, 2020, a decline in exclusivity levels or retention rates could have a material adverse effect on its ability to grow its revenues and execute its strategy. If Teads fails to provide sufficient advertising demand and expected levels of monetization, its publisher partners may consider renegotiating the terms of their contractual exclusivity or establishing relationships with our competitors. Furthermore, independent publishers struggle to compete with the Walled Gardens, which has driven some publishers out of business. When independent publishers go out of business, Teads experiences a decrease in access to premium advertising inventory, which may make its services less attractive to agencies and advertisers. Publishers may also opt to transition to a subscription model as an alternative method of providing their content, which would not include advertisements, which would also contribute to a decrease in our access to premium inventory. A decline in the market for programmatic advertising or the failure of that market to grow as expected could also adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of Teads.

The current macroeconomic environment is highly volatile, and continuing instability in global markets, including instability related to the COVID-19 pandemic, international trade, tariffs, sovereign debt issues, the risk of inflation and deflation and the stability of the euro, has contributed to a challenging global economic environment. High levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and certain European countries combined with weak growth and high unemployment could lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), sovereign debt restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and, potentially, disruptions in the credit and equity markets as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our business and financial operations. In Europe, future developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the EU Commission to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe and the overall stability of the Eurozone. As the countries in which we operate seek to recover from any natural disasters and pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or their governments seek new sources of revenue due to high fiscal deficit, such governments may impose new or increased taxes and levies. Accordingly, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain or declines further or the government increases taxes or levies as a result of fiscal deficits, pandemics or natural disasters. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects. Furthermore, we rely on third-party vendors for the equipment (including customer premises equipment, telecommunications equipment, network infrastructure and mobile handsets), software and services that we require in order to provide services to our customers. Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, international regulations or sanctions, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems or power supplies, terrorism, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and labor issues. With regard to currency instability issues, concerns exist in the Eurozone with respect to individual macro fundamentals on a country-by-country basis, as well as with respect to the overall stability of the European monetary union and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual Eurozone countries. Following the U.K.’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), the U.K. entered into a transition period which terminated on December 31, 2020, before which on December 24, 2020, the U.K. and the EU agreed to a trade deal (the “Trade and",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The severity and timing of the impact will depend on a number of factors, including the level and rapidity of infection, the speed and efficacy of national and global vaccination programs, duration of the pandemic and related containment measures, changes in consumer spending patterns, measures imposed or taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, macroeconomic conditions in our markets, and negative effects on the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and vendors. Under difficult economic conditions, including prolonged unemployment and employment furloughs, demand for our products and services could decline and some customers may be unable or unwilling to pay for our products and services. Additionally, in order to prioritize the demands of the business and/or depending on any restrictions that may be imposed by the governments in various jurisdictions on deployment of new infrastructure, we may, or may be required to, delay certain capital investments, such as fibre deployment or in other new initiatives, products or services, which may adversely affect our business in the future. If these events occur and were to continue, our revenue may be reduced materially which could result in reduced operating margins and a reduction in cash flows. While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a limited impact on our financial results for the year ended ----- December 31, 2020 and for the three months ended March 31, 2021, we have been impacted by a decline in handset sales in the context of the closure of shops and a decrease in roaming revenue due to decreased travel. Governmental and non-governmental initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of restrictions on work and public gatherings and the promotion of social distancing, along with certain temporary regulations concerning collections, or changes in consumer behaviour, have impacted and could continue to impact our operations and financial results. Even though the strict lockdown conditions are being lifted in certain jurisdictions, significant restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall world economy and, in turn, our operations. If a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work effectively due to prolonged illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions, facility closures or other reasons in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations could be further materially impacted. Our suppliers and vendors also may be affected by such measures in their ability to provide products and services to us and these measures could also make it more difficult for us to serve our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and there is a significant risk of recurring outbreaks in affected countries and possible future mutations in the virus may prove difficult to contain. For example, many countries in Europe have re-introduced full or partial lockdowns in late 2020 and 2021 in order to stem subsequent waves of higher infection rates. It is unclear whether measures being taken by governments across various jurisdictions to contain the COVID-19 pandemic are adequate and will be effective in achieving their goals. It is unclear when, if at all, the COVID-19 pandemic will be contained. We have implemented enhanced health and safety measures in our operations in line with public health rules and guidelines and industry practices to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the increase in costs associated with the implementation of such measures, we are also exposed to the risk of an increase in the number of workplace and third-party claims arising from actual or alleged failures to implement such measures adequately, or at all, and a potential increase in legal, advisory and other costs as a result of any COVID-19 pandemic related claims from workers or third party customers and suppliers that may come into contact with our operations. During the course of the pandemic, financial markets have been experiencing extreme fluctuations. Any similar fluctuations may cause a contraction in available liquidity globally as important segments of the markets react to the development. The pandemic may lead to a decline in business and consumer confidence and presents the risk of an economic recession around the globe, which could adversely impact our results. Further, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by the EU institutions, other countries in the EU and other geographies where we operate could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the future, including a destabilization of the EU or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of European integration.

These estimates and ----- assumptions form the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Areas requiring more complex judgments may shift over time based on changes in the business mix and industry practice which could affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. In addition, management’s judgments, estimates and assumptions and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses may be affected by changes in accounting policy. For instance, in January 2016, the International Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard (IFRS 16 (Leases)) which came into effect on January 1, 2019, superseding the previous standard (IAS 17) and its interpretations. The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method, with the date of initial application of January 1, 2019. IFRS 16 had a significant impact on our consolidated statement of financial position from periods beginning on January 1, 2019, due to the recognition of right-of-use (“ROU”) related to leased assets and corresponding lease liabilities. Moreover, our consolidated statement of profit or loss is impacted as operating lease fees corresponding to such ROU assets no longer comprise a part of operating expenses, but instead are recognized under depreciation and interest expenses. Our consolidated statement of cash flows is also impacted given that payment for lease liabilities is now presented within financing activities. See “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Group—Basis of Presentation”_ for more information.

As a result, we may face increases in taxes payable if tax rates increase, or if tax laws and regulations are modified by the competent authorities in an adverse manner. In addition, the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate periodically examine our activities. Any change in local or international tax rules, for example prompted by the implementation of the OECD’s recommendations on Base Erosion and Profits Shifting (a global initiative to improve the fairness and integrity of tax systems), or new challenges by tax authorities, may have an adverse effect on our tax status and our financial results. Any changes may also affect the return on an investors’ investment in the Group and result in changes in personal tax rates and tax relief. We have structured our commercial and financial activities in compliance with various regulatory obligations to which we are subject, as well as in line with our commercial and financial objectives. Significant judgment is required in determining the Group’s tax positions, including, amongst others, corporate income tax and value added tax (VAT). In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. To the extent that the laws and regulations of the various countries in which our companies are located or operate do not establish clear or definitive positions, the tax treatment applied to our activities or our intragroup reorganizations is sometimes based on interpretations of the applicable tax regulations.

At the core of the Group’s strategy is customer, revenue, profitability and cash flow growth by efficiently running telecom assets, creating underlying organic growth, and as a result, achieving a leverage profile consistent with the stated target leverage range. Key elements of this strategy include: (i) building operational and financial turnaround in Portugal; (ii) optimizing the performance in each market with a particular focus on customer services; (iii) continuing to invest in best-in-class infrastructure commensurate with our market position; (iv) growing advertising revenue; and (v) the potential monetization of part of the Group companies’ infrastructure and assets at attractive valuations. However, the Group is evolving in a market affected by economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainty and it must regularly adapt its business model to take into account market changes such as changes in consumer behavior, introduction of new technology, products or services, competition and the development of specific pricing policies, the adaptation of its structural costs, the streamlining of its operational organization, and the adaptation of its sales strategy. If the measures taken by the Group do not meet the demands, expectations, or habits of the consumer, it will have an adverse effect on the return on investments, financial targets, market share, and revenues generated. Consequently, any development of the Group’s business strategy that proves not to be sufficiently adapted to the actual trends and demands, expectations, or habits of the consumer in the telecommunications market may not achieve its desired goals and/or have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position and results of operations. Moreover, the transformation of the Group following the execution of certain strategic transactions, including non-core asset disposals, strategic acquisitions and investments or entry into joint venture arrangements, could create operational difficulties and unforeseen expenses and could give rise to significant administrative, financial, and managerial challenges involving the activity of the Group. Such strategic transactions may also disrupt our ongoing business, cause management’s attention to be diverted and result in legal, regulatory, contractual, labor, or other difficulties that have not been foreseen or disclosed. Historically, our business has grown, in part, through a significant number of acquisitions. We may continue to grow our business through selective acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses that we believe will present opportunities to create value by generating strong cash flows and operational synergies. The success of this strategy of pursuing strategic opportunities through selective acquisitions or other combinations depends on our ability to identify the appropriate targets, audit such targets appropriately, negotiate favorable terms, and carry out these transactions and integrate the new acquisitions. We may experience difficulties in integrating acquired operations into our business, incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies of these acquisitions, if any. Such transactions may also disrupt our relationships with current and new employees, customers and suppliers. In addition, our management may be distracted by such acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses. Such transactions may also be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions or require the approval of governmental authorities (either domestically or, in the case of the EU, at the EU level), which can block, impose conditions on, or delay the process. The failure to satisfy such conditions or obtain such approvals could result in a failure on our part to proceed with announced transactions on a timely basis or at all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In addition, future consolidations in the sectors where we operate will reduce opportunities for acquisitions or combinations. We believe that some of our competitors are implementing similar acquisition strategies and these competitors may have greater financial resources to make investments or may be able to accept less favorable terms than us, thus depriving us of opportunities and reducing the number of potential acquisition targets. The implementation of our acquisition strategy could increase the level of indebtedness of the Group, which could create new or intensify existing risks faced by the Group. See “—Risks Relating to our Financial Profile”. Furthermore, our ability to make acquisitions is limited by our financing agreements. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”. ----- We periodically evaluate, and have engaged in, strategic transactions, such as the sale of international wholesale assets, the Towers Transactions and the Altice Portugal FTTH Transaction. Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management’s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. Any divestiture undertaken by us could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In certain cases, the Group has entered into joint venture arrangements with a majority or minority interest in such joint ventures. Even in cases where the Group retained a majority interest, our joint venture partner may have significant influence over policies, including dividend policy and consent rights with respect to certain specified matters. The Group has a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which it has made minority investments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Hostilities involving Israel, any interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners and political instability within Israel or its neighboring countries are likely to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, in recent conflicts, missile attacks have occurred on civilian areas, which could cause substantial damage to our networks, affecting our overall network capacity and reducing our ability to continue serving our customers. In addition, in the event that recent political unrest and instability in the Middle East, including changes in some of the governments in the region, cause investor concern resulting in a reduction in the value of NIS, our expenses in non-Shekel currencies may increase, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During an emergency, including a major communications crisis in Israel’s national communications network, a natural disaster, or a special security situation in Israel, control of our networks may be assumed by a lawfully authorized person in order to protect the security of the State of Israel or to ensure the provision of necessary services to the public. During such circumstances, the government also has the right to temporarily withdraw some of the mobile spectrum granted to us. Under the Equipment Registration and Mobilization to the Israel Defense Forces Law, 1987, the Israel Defense Forces may mobilize our engineering equipment for their use, compensating us for such use and any consequent damage. This may materially harm our ability to provide services to our subscribers in such emergency circumstances and have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations. Moreover, the Prime Minister of Israel may, under powers which the Communications Law (Telecommunication and Broadcasting), 5742—1982 (the “Communications Law”) grants him for reasons of state security or public welfare, order us to provide services to the security forces to perform telecommunications activities and to set up telecommunications facilities required by the security forces to carry out their duties. Some of our officers and employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty. All reservists are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances. In addition, some of our employees may be forced to stay at home during emergency circumstances in their area. We cannot assess the full impact of these requirements on our workforce and business if such circumstances arise. More generally, any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability in the region would likely negatively affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations, including following the cessation of such conflicts, due to a potential decrease in the number of tourists visiting Israel. Several countries in the region, in particular Syria, have been experiencing increased political instability and armed conflict, which have led to changes in the governments of some of these countries, the effects of which are currently difficult to assess. Further, tensions have increased recently as a result of the nuclear deal between Iran and the United States and following Russia’s involvement in the Syrian war. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The Trade and Cooperation",13.3.12,Our business is capital-intensive and our capital expenditures may not generate a positive return or we may be unable or unwilling to make additional capital expenditures.,"Our business demands significant capital expenditures to add customers to our networks, including expenditures relating to equipment and labor. In particular, we incur and expect to continue to incur significant capital expenses for the deployment of new technologies such as 4G and 5G (for the purchase of frequencies and the deployment of network infrastructures) for our mobile operations and fiber optics (for the deployment of the fiber infrastructure) for our fixed operations. Moreover, as spectrum auctions are infrequent and we may need additional spectrum in the future, we will likely participate in future spectrum auctions even though we might not, at the time of auction, require additional spectrum capacity. Such participation would require significant capital expenditures in the near term as acquiring spectrum is expensive, due in part to the fact that spectrum availability is limited. For example, in Portugal, ANACOM recently approved regulation for rights of use of frequencies to be allocated in the 700 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2.1 GHz bands, 2.6 GHz and 3.6 GHz, in which context only a limited number of rights of use shall be attributed. Furthermore, in July 2019, the Israeli Ministry of Communications published a tender for 5G frequencies, and HOT submitted a joint proposal with Partner and each service provider won the following frequency bids: 10 MHz in the 700 MHz frequency range, 20 MHz in the 2,600 MHz frequency range and 50 MHz in the 3,500 MHz frequency range. Following the completion of the allocation in September 2020, HOT started offering 5G services in the first quarter of 2021 in certain areas in Israel. Further, in Portugal, the 5G spectrum auction started on December 22, 2020 and the allocation of rights of use for frequencies is expected in the third quarter of 2021. In the Dominican Republic, the 5G spectrum auction started on February 9, 2021 and the expected allocation of rights of use for frequencies is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect to participate in both of these auctions. Furthermore, new technologies and the use of multiple applications increasing customers’ bandwidth requirements could lead to saturation of the networks and require telecommunications operators to make additional investments to increase their infrastructure capacity. Moreover, we regularly invest in the content that we offer in order to provide our subscribers with a flexible and diverse range of programming and other content options, including high-quality local content and exclusive premium content, in order to reduce churn. We intend to continue to selectively invest in local and value-added premium content as well as sports broadcasting and distribution rights in the future in order to enrich our differentiated and convergent communication services from those of our competitors. Such investments are capital-intensive and no assurance can be given that our recent or future capital expenditures will decrease churn, increase ARPU, generate a positive return or that we will have adequate capital available to finance future upgrades or acquire additional content, programming or licenses. If we are unable to, or elect not to, pay for costs associated with adding new customers, expanding or upgrading our networks, or making our other planned or unplanned capital expenditures, our growth and competitive position may be materially adversely affected. We are also bound by certain obligations of access and/or coverage for our fiber/cable and/or mobile network, such as obligations to allow roaming or sharing of networks in certain deployment zones. This requires us to make significant and frequent investments and the conditions for the implementation of these obligations, including ----- some prices (such as roaming rates), may be regulated. Given such constraints, we may not be able to operate our network under economically favorable conditions, which could affect the profitability of our investments. We may be subject to similar obligations in the future, which could have a material effect on the manner in which we operate its business and, accordingly, on our outlook, financial position or results of operations. It cannot be guaranteed that we will continue to have sufficient resources to maintain the quality of our network and of our other products and services, and to expand our network coverage, which are key elements for our growth of over the long term.

Environmental and health concerns are expressed in numerous countries and particularly arise in the context of the deployment of mobile technology regarding exposure to electromagnetic fields through telecommunications equipment, relay antennas and WiFi. A number of studies have been conducted to examine the health effects of mobile phone use and network sites, and some of these studies have been construed as indicating that radiation from mobile phone use causes adverse health effects. The World Health Organization has classified the radiofrequency of electromagnetic fields, linked particularly with the use of cordless phones, as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”, but, to date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use. Several lawsuits have been filed against mobile operators and other participants in the mobile industry alleging adverse health effects and other claims relating to radio frequency transmissions to and from sites, handsets and other mobile telecommunications devices, including lawsuits against HOT, which were settled during 2012 with no material expenses incurred in such settlements. The Israeli government has contemplated, and in Portugal the government has adopted, measures to regulate matters related to exposure to electromagnetic waves. These have not, thus far, had a material impact on our business but there can be no guarantee that any future measures adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate will not have a material adverse impact on our business. The perception of increased health risks related to mobile network sites may also cause us increased difficulty in obtaining leases for new mobile network site locations or renewing leases for existing locations or otherwise in installing mobile telecommunication devices. The fears generated by the potential health risks connected with electromagnetic waves could also lead third parties to act against us by, for example, bringing actions demanding the withdrawal of antennas or towers, which could affect our conduct of operations and the deployment of our network, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. If it is ever determined that health risks existed or that there was a deviation from radiation standards which would result in a health risk from sites, other mobile devices or handsets, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including through exposure to potential liability, a reduction in subscribers and reduced usage per subscriber. Furthermore, we do not expect to be able to obtain insurance with respect to such liability.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The Trade and Cooperation",13.3.18,"If we are unable to obtain attractive content on satisfactory terms for our services, the demand for these services could be reduced, thereby lowering revenue and profitability.","The success of pay TV services depends on access to an attractive selection of television programming. For example, the ability to provide movies, sports and other popular programming, including video-on-demand (“VoD”) content, is a major factor that attracts subscribers to pay TV services, especially premium services. We rely on digital programming suppliers for a significant portion of our programming content and VoD services. We may not be able to obtain sufficient high quality programming and other content from third party producers for our digital cable television and other services on satisfactory terms or at all in order to offer compelling digital cable television services. We also rely on certain of our competitors for the provision of certain content offerings. In addition, to the extent that we are unable to reach agreements with certain content providers on terms that we believe are reasonable, we may be forced, or we determine for strategic or business reasons, to remove such content from our line-up and may decide to replace them with other programming, which may not be available on acceptable terms or be as attractive to customers. There can be no assurance that our expiring programming and ----- other content contracts will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms or at all, or that the rights we negotiate will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy. Further, with respect to our operations in Israel, we cannot assure you that the local content we are required to develop in conjunction with our partner studios will continue to be successful. The inability to obtain high quality content, may also limit our ability to migrate customers from lower tier programming to higher tier programming, thereby inhibiting our ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, we are currently subject to “must carry” requirements in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate that may consume channel capacity otherwise available for other services. Any or all of these factors could result in reduced demand for, and lower revenue and profitability from, our digital cable television and other content services. Programming and content-related costs are one of our largest categories of expenses. In recent years, the cost of programming in the cable and satellite video industries has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase, particularly with respect to costs for sports programming and broadcast networks. We may not be able to pass these increased programming costs on to our subscribers due to the increasingly competitive environment that we operate in. If we are unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our subscribers, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, programming costs typically include a minimum guaranteed amount and a variable amount related directly to the number of subscribers to whom the programming is provided, which may affect our ability to negotiate lower per-subscriber programming costs and which could impact our operating margins. The expiration dates of our various programming contracts are staggered, which results in the expiration of a portion of our programming contracts throughout each year. We may not be able to renegotiate these agreements on terms as favorable as those of the current agreements, or at all, which could result in a decline in the revenue generated or an increase in our costs deriving from broadcaster licences. We also face the risk of not being able to obtain new broadcast rights for content (including premium sports content) or unexpected cancellations of the existing agreements as a result of factors beyond our control, including due to termination of the rights or licenses held by third party content suppliers. We attempt to control our programming costs and, therefore, the cost of our video services we charge to our customers, by negotiating favorable terms for the renewal of our affiliation agreements with programmers. To the extent we are unable to reach agreements with certain programmers on terms we believe are reasonable, we may be forced to, or determine for strategic reasons to, remove certain programming from our line-up and may decide to replace such programming with alternatives which may not be as attractive to consumers or available on acceptable terms. Such negotiations have in the past and may in the future affect our carriage of particular programming services. Some of our programming contracts require us to pay prices for the programming based on a guaranteed minimum number of subscribers, even if that number is larger than the number of actual subscribers, whereas some of our programming contracts are based on a flat fee irrespective of the popularity of the content purchased under such contract. As a result, if we misjudge anticipated demand for the programming or if the programming we acquire does not attract the number of viewers we anticipated, the profitability of our television services may be impaired. Furthermore, as we purchase a significant portion of our content from various content providers under relatively short term contracts, the prices we pay to purchase such content are subject to change and may increase significantly in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, program providers and broadcasters may elect to distribute their programming through other distribution platforms, such as satellite platforms, digital terrestrial broadcasting or IPTV, or may enter into exclusive arrangements with other distributors. Such actions may inconvenience some of our subscribers and can lead to customer dissatisfaction and, in certain cases, the loss of customers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, as long as we continue to develop our VoD and other interactive services, our ability to acquire programs for our free VoD offerings (replay), VoD by subscription, and one-time VoD will become more and more crucial and will depend on our ability to maintain a relationship and cooperation with content providers and broadcasters, for both standard-definition as well as HD content. If we cannot obtain and keep competitive programs at attractive prices on our networks, demand for our services could decline, thus limiting our ability to maintain or increase the revenue. A loss of programs or an inability to ensure the availability of premium content under favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business activities, our financial position and results of operations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

In certain cases, we have made substantial investments in the equipment or software of a particular supplier, making it difficult for us to quickly change supply and maintenance relationships in the event that our initial supplier refuses to offer us favorable prices or ceases to produce equipment or provide the support that we require. For example, while we continue to promote a rapid take up of our premium multi-play services in several geographies where we operate using a single set-top box, we face potential risks in securing the required customer set-top box equipment to maintain this roll out as we currently rely on a single provider. Currently, we have a sufficient supply of these boxes available, but any future shortages may involve significant delays in seeking alternative supplies, may constrain our ability to meet customer demand and may result in increased customer churn. There was an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in some categories of the supply chain in the Dominican Republic, Israel and Portugal due to an increase of lead times (specifically for chipsets), increase in transportation costs and delays in some shipments (mostly by sea). There has also been a shortage of chips globally. Further, in the event that hardware or software products or related services are defective, it may be difficult or impossible to enforce recourse claims against suppliers, especially if warranties included in contracts with suppliers have expired or are exceeded by those in our contracts with our subscribers, in individual cases, or if the suppliers are insolvent, in whole or in part. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain the hardware, software and services we need for the operation of our business in a timely manner, at competitive terms and in adequate amounts. In particular, in the case of an industry wide cyclical upturn or high demand for a particular product, our suppliers of software, hardware and other services may receive customer orders beyond the capacity of their operations, which could result in delivery delays, particularly where suppliers elect to prioritize other customer accounts. We have, from time to time, experienced extensions of lead times or limited supplies due to capacity constraints and other supply-related factors as well as quality control problems with service providers. We may also not be able to recover monies paid to such suppliers or obtain contractual damages to which we may be entitled (if any) in the event our suppliers fail to comply with their obligations in a timely manner. We also outsource some of our support services, including parts of our subscriber services, information technology support, technical services, and maintenance operations. Should any of these arrangements be terminated by either contract party, this could result in delays or disruptions to our operations and could result in us incurring additional costs, including if the outsourcing counterparty increases pricing or if we are required to locate alternative service providers or in-source previously outsourced services. Further, we are dependent on certain suppliers with respect to our mobile services in Israel who we may not be able to replace without incurring significant costs. With respect to our 3G/4G mobile operations, we have engaged Nokia Solutions and Networks (“NSN”) as a turnkey contractor to plan and build the UMTS/LTE network core. A cessation or interruption in the supply of the products and/or services by NSN may harm our ability to provide our mobile services to our subscribers. We are dependent on various third parties in order to provide commercially viable services in the jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, among other agreements, we rely on the Partner Network Sharing Agreement to hold, develop and operate an advanced shared mobile network in Israel and a Fiber Sharing Agreement with Vodafone Portugal to deploy, share and manage fiber capacity in Portugal. We are generally dependent on access to sites and network infrastructure owned by third parties, including duct space and antennas used for our networks and facility space (colocation). In addition, our telephony services are reliant on our ability to interconnect with the telecommunications networks of other fixed-line, mobile and international operators globally. We have limited or no control over the quality and consistency of the services that are supplied to us by third parties. Any deterioration in the provision of such services may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to renew our existing contracts with suppliers of products or services or enter into new contractual relationships with these or other suppliers upon the expiration of existing agreements, either on commercially attractive terms, or at all, depends on a range of commercial and operational factors and events which may be beyond our control. The occurrence of any of these risks or a significant disruption in our supply of equipment and services from key sourcing partners could create technical problems, damage our reputation, result in the loss ----- of customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Since 2010, we have acquired HOT in Israel, PT Portugal in Portugal, Teads, a video advertising marketplace and Altice Dominicana in the Dominican Republic. We may continue to grow our business through acquisitions of broadband and mobile communications businesses, content companies and ancillary services that we believe will present opportunities to create value by generating strong cash flows and operational synergies. In addition, we have in the past few years entered into certain strategic transactions, such as the Towers Transactions, the sale of our voice carrier business, to monetize the value of certain of our noncore assets in Portugal and the Dominican Republic, the OMTEL Sale Transaction and the Altice Portugal FTTH Transaction. In the future, we may enter into similar transactions in one or more countries in which we operate. Any acquisition, disposal or other strategic transaction we may undertake in the future could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expenses, amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets or in the use by us of available cash on hand to finance any such acquisitions. We may experience difficulties in integrating acquired operations into our business, incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies of these acquisitions, if any. Such transactions may also disrupt our relationships with current and new employees, customers and suppliers. In addition, our management may be distracted by such acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses. Thus, if we consummate any further acquisitions or fail to integrate any previous acquisitions, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing business acquisitions or integrating previously acquired companies. In addition, our debt burden may increase if we borrow funds to finance any future transactions, which could have a negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to finance our overall operations. Acquisitions or disposals of additional telecommunications companies may require the approval of governmental authorities (either domestically or, in the case of the EU, at the EU level), which can block, impose conditions on, or delay the process which could result in a failure on our part to proceed with announced transactions on a timely basis or at all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to meet them in a timely manner, the relevant governmental authority may impose fines and, in connection with a merger transaction, may require restorative measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of operations. For example, in connection with the PT Portugal Acquisition, we entered into a commitment with the European Commission (“EC”) to dispose of Cabovisão and ONI which was completed on January 20, 2016. Additionally, in connection with the PT Portugal Acquisition, the EC is conducting an ongoing investigation relating to Altice Europe’s alleged infringement of the obligation of prior notification of concentrations under Article 4(1) of the EU Merger Regulation and/or of the standstill obligation laid down in Article 7(1) of the Merger Regulation. The EC issued a statement of objections on May 18, 2017 alleging that Altice Europe breached the Merger Regulation by implementing the PT Portugal Acquisition before notification or approval by the EC as required under applicable law. On August 18, 2017, Altice Europe submitted a full response to the statement of objections in which it contested all of the objections and requested that a hearing take place. A hearing took place in Brussels on September 21, 2017. On April 24, 2018, the EC notified the Group of its decision to impose upon it a fine of approximately €125 million on the basis of a finding that the Group infringed the prior notification obligations of a concentration under Article 4(1) of the EU Merger Regulation as well as the stand-still obligation under Article 7(1) of the Merger Regulation. The Group disputed the EC’s decision and on July 5, 2018, the Group filed an appeal against the decision before the General Court of the European Union (“GCEU”) seeking an annulment of the decision or, at the very least, a significant reduction in the fine imposed. On November 6, 2018, the Council of the EU filed an application to intervene in the case. On July 25, 2018, the Group issued a bank guarantee to the EC. On November 30, 2018, the EC lodged a defense, to which the Group replied on February 25, 2019, in line with the submissions set forth in its appeal. These proceedings do not affect the approval granted by the EC for the PT Portugal Acquisition. See “Description of our Business—Legal Proceedings—Portugal— _Regulatory and Civil Proceedings—European Commission Investigation into PT Portugal Acquisition” and_ “Description of Other Indebtedness—2018 Altice Financing Guarantee Facility”. ----- Although we analyze and conduct due diligence on acquisition targets, our assessments are subject to a number of assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations and our inquiries may fail to uncover relevant information. There can be no assurance that our assessments or due diligence of and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. Moreover, our plans to acquire additional businesses in the future are subject to the availability of suitable opportunities. Our competitors may also follow similar acquisition strategies and may have greater financial resources available for investments or may be willing to accept less favorable terms than we can accept, which may prevent us from acquiring businesses that we target to the benefit of our competitors. The operating complexity of our business and the responsibilities of management have increased significantly as a result of the growth of our business through acquisitions, which may place significant strain on our managerial and operational resources. We may be unable to allocate sufficient managerial and operational resources to meet our needs as our business grows, and our current operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures may become inadequate. Although we consider the operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures that we currently have in place to be adequate for our purposes, we recognize that the effectiveness of these systems, controls and procedures needs to be kept under regular review as our business grows. We will have to maintain close coordination among our logistical, technical, accounting, finance, marketing and sales personnel.

The introduction of new product offerings can initially place significant pressure on our customer service personnel. Increased pressure on such functions is generally associated with decreased satisfaction of customers. In the business services market, customers require service to be extremely reliable and to be re-established within short timeframes if there is any disruption. Penalties are often payable in the case of failure to meet expected service quality. In addition, product installation can be complex, requiring specialized knowledge and expensive equipment. Delays and service problems may result in both penalties and the potential loss of customers. In these segments, we rely on our experienced customer relations personnel to handle any customer issues or requests, and the loss of such personnel can result in the loss of customers. We have in the past experienced significant levels of customer dissatisfaction as a result of operational difficulties. Improvements to customer service functions may be necessary to achieve desired growth levels and if we fail to manage such improvements effectively and achieve such growth, we may in the future experience customer service problems and damage to our reputation, contributing to increased churn and/or limiting or slowing our future growth.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

We have developed the brands we use through extensive marketing campaigns, website promotions, customer referrals, and the use of a dedicated sales force and dealer networks. For a description of our brands and offers, see “Description of Our Business— _Significant Contracts”._ Our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance the image and reputation of our existing products and services and to develop a favorable image and reputation for new products and services. The image and reputation of our products and services may be adversely affected by several factors, including if concerns arise about (i) the quality, reliability and benefit/cost balance of our products and services, (ii) the quality of our support centers or (iii) our ability to deliver the level of service advertised. An event or series of events that threatens the reputation ----- of one or more of our brands, or one or more of our products could have an adverse effect on the value of that brand or product and subsequent revenues therefrom. Restoring the image and reputation of our products and services may be costly and not always possible. We rely upon copyright, trademark and patent laws to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, but no assurance can be given that the actions they have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent violation of our intellectual property rights.

The Trade and Cooperation",13.3.23,We are subject to requirements in terms of protection of personal data and data security.,"Within the context of our business activities, we must collect and process personal data, including that of current, past and prospective employees, customers and the third parties with whom we work. We accumulate, store and use data in the ordinary course of our operations that is protected by data protection laws. Regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate our businesses have the right to audit us as well as the right to impose fines if they find we have not complied with applicable laws or adequately protected customer data. Some jurisdictions allow individuals affected by our non-compliance to claim compensation or damages in certain circumstances. In the EU, the European Parliament and the European Council adopted the regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, the “GDPR”) on April 27, 2016. The GDPR has been directly applicable in all EU Member States since May 25, 2018, replacing Directive 95/46/EC and current national data protection legislation in EU Member States, and was implemented in the EEA countries with effect from the same date. The purpose of the GDPR is to provide for the protection of the individual’s right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data. The GDPR is directly applicable in all EEA Member States, creating a single legal framework that results in a more uniform application of data privacy laws across the EU. The GDPR significantly changes the EU/EEA data protection landscape, including strengthening of individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines of up to 4% of our annual turnover. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to let a privacy organization litigate on their behalf, including collecting the potential damages. After an initial transition period, data protection authorities across the EU have now begun using their new sanctioning powers (in 2019, Google was fined €50 million by the French authority (CNIL), and in 2020 British Airways and Marriott were fined £20 million and £18 million, Telecom Italia was fined €28 million by the Italian Authority (GRANTA), and H&M €35 million by the regulator in Hamburg, Germany (HmbBfDl). Many other and many cases are currently under investigation). Following Brexit, the GDPR has been imposed in UK law pursuant to the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”). The UK’s data protection regime primarily consists of the UK GDPR and the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 (the “UK DP Laws”). The relationship between the UK and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is also unclear how the UK DP Laws will develop in the medium to longer term. However, the UK government recently announced its intention to adopt a more flexible approach to the regulation of data, and as a result there remains a risk of future divergence between the EU and UK data protection regimes. The GDPR creates two main roles in data processing that of data controller and that of data processor. We will be the data controller with respect to personal data that we collect and determine the use for, _i.e., processing employment related data of our employees, and a data processor where we act on behalf of clients, i.e., hosting data or providing data-related services. In each role will be required to comply with the provisions of the GDPR and where applicable the UK DP Laws, which are extensive and require consistent and thorough application. The GDPR and UK DP Laws implement more stringent operational requirements and onerous accountability obligations for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, requiring expanded disclosures ----- about how personal data is to be used, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification requirements, and higher standards for controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities. Data controllers must put in place the necessary mechanisms to allow relevant individuals to exercise their data subject rights, such as the right to access and rectify their personal data, the right to impose restrictions on processing, and in certain circumstances the right to request the deletion of personal data, to request the transfer of such data to another controller and to object to the processing of their personal data. The GDPR and the UK GDPR provide that the Member States and the UK respectively may make their own additional laws and regulations in relation to certain data processing activities, and may impose stricter governance requirements, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could require localized changes to our operating models (if applicable). Through our operations in Portugal, we do business in the hosting of data relating to the health of individuals, which subjects us to the specific obligations provided for by the Public Health Code such as obtaining and maintaining authorization or certification for the hosting of such data. If we breach our obligations or fail to adhere to the requirements applicable to sensitive data processing, we may be subjected to criminal and financial penalties likely to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. To the extent applicable, we are also subject to certain rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the EEA and the UK. Recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA and the United Kingdom to the U.S. Most recently, on July 16, 2020, the CJEU invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (“Privacy Shield”) under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to US entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. Use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals and additional measures and/or contractual provisions may need to be put in place, however, the nature of these additional measures is currently uncertain. The CJEU went on to state that if a competent supervisory authority believes that the standard contractual clauses cannot be complied with in the destination country and the required level of protection cannot be secured by other means, such supervisory authority is under an obligation to suspend or prohibit that transfer. These recent developments are likely to require us to review and amend the legal mechanisms by which we make and/or receive personal data transfers to/in the U.S. and other countries outside the EEA and the UK. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used, and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations. On January 1, 2021, following Brexit the UK became a third country for the purposes of EU law, such that transfers of personal data from the EU to the UK are permitted only where there is a lawful mechanism under the GDPR. In February 2021, the European Commission issued a draft finding of data protection adequacy for the UK, which is currently being assessed by the European Data Protection Board and will thereafter require approval from representatives of the EU Member States. If the draft finding is not finalised within six months of January 31, 2020, or the UK otherwise does not receive an adequacy finding, the business will no later than June 30, 2021 be required to safeguard transfers of personal data sent from the EU to the UK through the use of standard contractual clauses or other approved mechanisms. This could create additional legal and compliance costs for the business and could result in additional legal and regulatory risks where such transfers are not conducted in accordance with the GDPR, the UK DP Laws and the requirements set out in the CJEU’s judgment. Mirroring the scope of the GDPR local legislation is increasingly in favour of protecting personal data on an extraterritorial basis. Brazil has recently implemented the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (the “LGPD”), enforcement of which began in May 2021 with penalties and sanctions for non-compliance provided therein being enforced from August 1, 2021. The LGPD applies to organizations in Brazil as well as organizations that process personal data for the purpose of offering or supplying goods and services to individuals in Brazil. In the United ----- States, state consumer protection laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which became effective on January 1, 2020, also establish privacy and security standards for use and protection of data. The CCPA provides California residents with certain rights regarding the collection or processing of their personal data, against any organization processing their data irrespective of location. Additionally, a recent California ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), imposes additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and optouts for certain uses of sensitive data and sharing of personal data starting in January 2023. As voted into law by California residents in November 2020, the CPRA could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot yet fully predict the impact of the CCPA and CPRA, or subsequent related regulations or guidance, on business or operations of Teads, but it may require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Local data protection laws may have an impact on the business requiring changes to business models or processes and create significant costs associated with litigation, settlements, regulatory action, judgments, liabilities or penalties. In 2016, the CJEU further clarified what safeguards are required for data retention to be lawful. In the case of _Tele2 Sverige and Home Secretary v. Watson, the court concluded that the EU Member States cannot impose a_ general obligation on providers of electronic telecommunications services to retain data, but did not ban data retention altogether. Such retention is compatible with EU law if deployed against specific targets to fight serious crime. Retention measures must be necessary and proportionate regarding the categories of data to be retained, the means of communication affected, the persons concerned and the chosen duration of retention. Furthermore, national authorities’ access to the retained data must be conditional and meet certain data protection safeguards. New data retention rules are currently being discussed at an EU level in response to this decision. In the case of Breyer, the CJEU concluded that IP addresses may constitute personal data where the individual concerned can be identified, even where a third party must obtain additional data for the identification to take place. This is now reflected in the drafting of the GDPR. The CJEU also held that website operators may rely on a legitimate interest as a legal basis when retaining and using their visitors’ personal data. This is of major importance for data retention rules; it follows that online media service providers can lawfully store their visitors’ personal data to pursue a legitimate interest, rather than just for the purposes previously outlined in the invalidated Data Retention Directive. Thus, the grounds justifying data retention have become broader. The EU e-Privacy Regulation which will replace the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002/58/EC is currently in unagreed draft form. The EU e-Privacy Regulation covers not only personal data but all access of a user’s equipment, which is usually made in relation to the placement of cookies, as well as issues relating to the use of email for commercial marketing and for commercial marketing and telecommunications. The current draft of the EU e-Privacy Regulation aligns issues such as consent with the GDPR. It also aligns the potential fines for non-compliance with the 4% of turnover as set out in the GDPR. The EU e-Privacy Regulation was first drafted to be implemented in May 2018 along with the GDPR, but as the text remains unapproved it is unlikely that the EU e-Privacy Regulation will be implemented before 2021. Regardless of the measures we adopt to protect the confidentiality, security of data and respect the rights of the people whose data we process, there remains the risk of possible attacks or breaches of data processing systems, which could give rise to penalties and damage our reputation. We could be compelled to incur additional costs in order to protect against these risks or to mitigate the consequences thereof, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations or outlook. Furthermore, any loss of confidence on the part of our customers as a result of such events could lead to a significant decline in sales and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

If any new or enhanced technologies, products or services that we introduce fail to achieve broad market acceptance or experience technical difficulties, our revenue growth, margins and cash flows may be adversely affected. As a result, we may not recover investments that we make in order to deploy these technologies and services. Enhanced fixed service infrastructure access and mobile services provided by competing operators may be more appealing to customers, and new technologies may enable our competitors to offer not only new services, but to also offer existing standard services at lower prices. We may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments. It is possible that alternative technologies that are more advanced than those we currently provide may be developed. We may not obtain the expected benefits of our investments if more advanced technology is adopted by the market. While we attempt to stay ahead of the market, closely following technological developments and making investments implementing such developments, it is difficult to forecast the effect that technical innovations will have on our business. We may also be unable to adapt to new or existing technologies to meet customer needs within an appropriate time frame, or a competitor may do so before us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we adopt new technologies in a timely manner as they are developed, the cost of such technology may exceed their benefits. Our inability to obtain the funding or other resources necessary to expand or further upgrade our systems and provide advanced services in a timely manner, or successfully anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and generate revenue. Furthermore, given the pace at which we launch new offers into the market and the multitude of our bundled service offerings, we may experience vulnerability to revenue leakage as a result of the dynamic changes in networks and IT systems. Our revenue chain consists of a complex set of inter-related technologies and processes providing a seamless set of services to the end customer. Although we closely monitor the risks related to revenue loss and continuously improve controls in our revenue assurance processes in order to prevent and/or detect cases of revenue leakage, as the set of technologies and business processes grows bigger and more complex, the chance of failure increases in each connection of the revenue chain. Revenue leakage may have an impact on the Group’s ability to bill customers correctly for a given service or to receive the correct payment, which may adversely affect our margins and profitability. We anticipate that, over time, new products and services we may introduce will require upgraded or new customer premises equipment, which may constrain our ability to market and distribute such new products and services. For example, we do not expect that previously installed internet modems or set-top boxes will be able to support all the enhancements we may introduce to our broadband internet or pay TV services over time. A portion of our subscribers will therefore require some form of upgrade or potentially a replacement of their customer premises equipment. Implementing such upgrades may entail additional costs to us and could delay the introduction of enhanced services and therefore reduce our cash flow and profitability, particularly where customers rent such customer premise equipment from us. In addition, we will need to expend significant capital expenditure to fulfill universal service obligations and to upgrade the parts of our networks that are xDSL. In particular, we must also continue to increase and improve the functionality, availability, and characteristics of our network, particularly by improving its bandwidth capacity and its 4G coverage, as well as introduction of 5G technology, to meet the growing demand for the services that require very-high-speed telephony and internet services as the telecommunications industry in each of the markets we operate is facing challenges relating to: (i) rapid, significant technological evolution; (ii) frequent improvement of existing products or services resulting from the emergence of new technologies; and (iii) the establishment of new industry practices and standards that make current systems and technologies obsolete.

We have no control over the quality and timing of the investment and maintenance activities that are necessary for these entities to provide us with interconnection to their respective telecommunications networks. In Israel, for instance, the implementation of number portability requires us to rely on other providers to a greater extent since our ability to implement number portability and to port numbers between operators is dependent on the manner of number portability implementation by interconnecting local operators. The failure of these or other telecommunications providers to provide reliable interconnections to us on a consistent basis and under terms that are favorable to us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations. In addition, interconnection agreements and interconnection rates are normally subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Reduced interconnection rates and other decisions by regulators may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

We are exposed to various risks related to these agreements and arrangements. For instance, under the network sharing agreements, we are dependent upon other players for a part of their networks. In particular, we may not have any direct operational control of and may have no control over a portion of the networks that are managed by the counterparties to the network sharing agreements. Therefore, we will not be able to control the quality of the network through which we provide services to our customers or to implement corrective measures necessary in the event of defect and will be exposed to the risk of failure on the part of its counterparties. Additionally, our arrangements may fail to generate the expected synergies, especially in terms of geographic coverage or quality of service. Delays in implementation may affect our ability to achieve the objectives of geographic coverage and quality of service. Implementation of arrangements will also require significant capital expenditures and there can be no assurance that we will be able to make a return on such investment or recoup such investments. Further, in the event of partial or total cessation and/or failure of such arrangements, we may have to redeploy networks and/or incur significant capital expenditure on build-up or maintenance of networks in the zones covered by such agreements so as to maintain our geographic coverage and the quality of services. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that we will be able, in such a scenarios, to implement coverage equivalent to that enjoyed by customers under our joint agreements. The competent authorities may, in the future, make decisions jeopardizing the overall economics and/or validity of such arrangements with other players in the market. Third parties may also seek to gain access to shared networks and take action against us and our partners. ----- We have entered into roaming contracts, which provide our customers with international 3G and 4G roaming services, across all geographies where we operate. These contracts are generally subject to rights of termination upon sufficient notice, in the event of a material breach or upon the commencement of liquidation or insolvency proceedings. In the event that we are unable to reach agreements with third parties or favorably renegotiate or renew our existing roaming, network sharing agreements or other agreements on terms we believe are reasonable, our fixed-based and mobile services may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that our agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms.

In this respect, we have generally obtained leases, rights and licenses from network operators, including incumbent operators, governmental authorities and individuals. For example, in July 2014, we signed the Vodafone Network Sharing Agreement with Vodafone Portugal to deploy, swap capacity and share fiber networks beginning in December 2014, for an initial term of 25 years. See “Description of our Business— _Significant Contracts—Portugal—Fiber Sharing Agreement with Vodafone Portugal”. In addition, in November_ 2013 we entered into a Network Sharing Agreement with Partner pursuant to which HOT Mobile and Partner own equal shares and have joint control of Phi Networks (2015) Limited Partnership (“PHI”), which holds, develops and operates an advanced shared mobile network for both companies in Israel. Regulatory approval for the network sharing agreement was obtained on April 20, 2015 and such agreement remains valid until December 31, 2028. Our ability to offer our services to customers depends on the performance of these third parties of their obligations under such leases, licenses and rights. If we are not able to renew our current lease agreements for these sites and/or enter into new lease agreements for suitable alternate sites, this could have a negative impact on the coverage of our network. If third parties refuse to or only partially fulfill their obligations under or terminate the licenses granted to us or prevent the required access to certain or all of such sites, it could prevent or delay the connection to sites or customers, limit the growth of our offerings and influence our ability to supply high quality services to our customers in a timely and cost effective manner. In addition, the costs of providing services is dependent on the pricing and technical terms under which we are given such access and any change in such terms may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Trade and Cooperation",13.3.35,"The continuity of our services strongly depends on the proper functioning of our IT and network infrastructure and any failure of this infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial position and results of our operations.","The reliability and quality (both in terms of service as well as availability) of our information systems and networks, particularly for our mobile and fixed businesses, are key components of our business activities, the continuity of our services and the confidence of our customers. More specifically, the unavailability or failure of information systems we use, our network, the production of “electronic” communications services and television, our website, and our customer service function, could significantly disrupt our business. A flood, fire, other natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, power failure, cyber-attack, computer virus or other catastrophe affecting a portion of our network could have a material adverse impact on our business and our relations with customers. For example, our business in the Dominican Republic has experienced network disruptions and other adverse effects in the past, and may experience network disruption and other adverse effects in the future, as a result of extreme weather and other environmental conditions. Measures with the aim of remedying such disasters, safety and security measures, or measures for protecting service continuity that we undertake or may undertake in the future, as well as the effects thereof on the performance of our network, could be insufficient to avoid losses. As we are insured against operating losses only up to a capped amount, any disaster or other damage affecting our network could result in significant uninsured losses. Our network may be subjected to disruptions and to significant technological problems, and such difficulties could escalate over time. For example, although our cable networks are generally built in resilient rings to ensure the continuity of network availability in the event of any damage to our underground fibers, if any ring is cut twice in different locations, transmission signals will not be able to pass through, which could cause significant damage to our business. In the event of a power outage or other shortage, we do not have a back-up or alternative supply source for all of our network components. The occurrence of any such event could cause interruptions in service or reduce capacity ----- for customers, either of which could reduce our revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses. In addition, the occurrence of any such event may subject us to penalties and other sanctions imposed by regulators. Further, we may incur costs and revenue losses associated with the unauthorized use of our networks, including administrative and capital costs associated with the unpaid use of our networks as well as with detecting, monitoring and reducing the incidences of fraud. Fraud also impacts interconnection costs, capacity costs, administrative costs and payments to other carriers for unbillable fraudulent roaming charges. Additionally, our business depends on certain crucial systems, particularly our network operations center and our billing and customer service systems. In particular, the support for a large number of systems critical to our network is located at a relatively limited number of sites. While we have extensive backup systems, the risk that these systems may not be sufficient to handle a spike in activity cannot be ruled out, which could lead to a slowdown or unavailability of IT systems for a period of time and, when involving our business services customers, to financial penalties. Moreover, we may incur legal penalties and reputational damages to the extent that any accident or security breach results in a loss of or damage to customers’ data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information. Moreover, our technical projects that are in progress, involving both information systems and networks, and the plans for migrations planned in the short and medium terms for certain pieces of mobile network equipment, may generate an increased risk of failures of networks and information systems. In particular, the quality of the networks could be impacted by the deployment of the 4G and 5G networks as well as by the concurrent work of renovating 2G and 3G networks, requiring, among other things, frequent technical interventions. Such work could also result in breakdowns or interruptions in services for our customers. Furthermore, the development of the resources used by consumers (for example, videoconferencing, telepresence, and cloud computing for business services customers), of the IoT, and of new terminals (smartphones, tablets, etc.) may generate risks of saturating the networks due to the large volumes of data that such resources generate or promote the use of. The end-of-year period is an extremely sensitive sales period. A major failure of the information systems or of any component of the chain of production and logistics during that period would have negative consequences on revenues. To reduce the likelihood of this type of risk occurring, we avoid changes to our network and information systems during this period of the year (starting in mid-November until the end of the year), however, there can be no assurance that there will be no failure of our network and information systems during the end-of-year period.

Customer churn is a measure of the number of customers who stop subscribing for one or more of our products or services. Churn arises mainly as a result of the contractual subscription period (generally 12 months in the residential segment and between one and three years in the business services segment), competitive influences, the relocation of clients outside of the Group’s network areas, introduction of new products and technologies, deterioration of personal financial circumstances, price increases and regulatory developments. Customer churn may also increase if we are unable to deliver satisfactory services over our network, or if we modify the types of services we make available in a certain region. In addition, customer churn also arises upon the cancellation of services to customers who are delinquent in their payments to the Group. In addition, we outsource many of our customer service functions to third party contractors over which we have less control than if we were performing those tasks ourselves. We have experienced significant churn in mobile and fixed customers in recent years due to intense competition. For example, in Israel, the regulatory framework prohibits, among other things, fixed-based service providers and mobile operators from charging exit fees, except in limited circumstances, to subscribers who wish to terminate their services and mobile operators are prohibited from selling locked handsets or linking the terms of sale of handsets to the terms of mobile services, including discounts and other benefits, which has increased churn rates for many fixed-based service providers and mobile operators. If we fail to effectively communicate the benefits of our networks through our marketing and advertising efforts, we may not be able to attract new customers and our efforts to attract and retain customers may prove unsuccessful. In addition, any interruption of our services or the removal or unavailability of programming, which may not be under our control, could contribute to increased customer churn. Further our competitors may improve their ability to attract new customers, for example by offering new product bundles or product offerings at lower prices than us, which would make it difficult for us to retain our current subscribers, and the cost of retaining and acquiring new subscribers could increase. In addition, our business services operations are also subject to tariff churn (i.e. an existing customer negotiating tariff decreases). Large corporate customers in particular are highly sophisticated and often aggressive in seeking to renegotiate the pricing of their contracts, which tends to result in margin pressure. Increased customer or tariff churn may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Salaries payable to pre-retired and suspended employees are obligations under individual agreements with employees to pay employees a significant portion of their previous existing salary to refrain from working until retirement. In Portugal, we launched voluntary employee reduction programs in January 2019 and March 2021, aimed at employees aged 50 years or more, in accordance with which their employment agreements shall be terminated, and those employees will be entitled to receive a monthly fixed compensation up to retirement age corresponding to a significant percentage of their previous remuneration that varies based on the age of the employees. The January 2019 scheme covered approximately 850 employees (mainly in support functions). Under the March 2021 scheme, as of March 31, 2021, we have reached agreements with approximately 750 employees and recognized a liability of €241 million, corresponding primarily to the present value of salaries payable up to retirement age to the employees that agreed to terminate their employment agreements under pre-retirement schemes. Based on information up to date, we expect to record an additional liability in the second quarter of 2021 relating to approximately 200 employees. Further, in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Portugal, there is no legislation on the establishment of funds to cover the healthcare obligations and the salaries for pre-retired and suspended employees, and PT Portugal is required to pay for these benefits only when the salaries are paid to pre-retired and suspended employees, or when healthcare expenses are incurred. Accordingly, there is no requirement in Portugal to fund these benefits obligations at present. However, PT Portugal has nevertheless set up a fund managed by a subsidiary, PT Prestações—Mandatária de Aquisições e Gestão de Bens, S.A., to finance the such healthcare-related postretirement liabilities. No similar fund has been established to pay salaries owed to pre-retired and suspended employees. The value of the obligations referred to above may also fluctuate, depending on demographic, financial, ----- legal or regulatory factors that are beyond our control. For example, the legal retirement age in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Portugal, has been raised in the past and may be raised further in the future which could increase our obligations to pay salaries to suspended and pre-retired employees.

Risks associated with operating in the Dominican Republic include, but are not limited to: ----- - high interest rates; - devaluation or depreciation of the currency; - inflation; - changes in governmental economic, tax or other policies; - the potential introduction of exchange controls; - the imposition of trade barriers; - dependence on remittances and tourism; - the scarcity of available foreign exchange; - significant oil price increases and commodity price volatility (especially with regards to gold); - economic and political instability; and - expropriation and political violence or disturbance. Our operations could be affected by changes in the economic or other policies of the Dominican Republic government or other political, regulatory or economic authorities in the country. Historically, past governments have intervened in the nation’s economy. Among other things, past governments have imposed import and export controls. There can be no assurance that controls, such as exchange controls, will not be introduced in the future. Future developments in the Dominican Republic politics, such as changes in economic, political or regulatory policies including government induced effects on inflation, devaluation and economic growth, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations. Historically, the Dominican Republic has experienced high rates of inflation. Inflation, as well as government efforts to combat inflation or stabilize DOP, has in the past had significant negative effects on the Dominican Republic economy, most recently in 2003 and 2004, when inflation rates, as measured by the Dominican Consumer Price Index (Indice de Precios al Consumidor, or the Dominican CPI) were 42.7% and 28.7%, respectively, resulting from an acute economic crisis precipitated by the collapse of Baninter, the country’s second largest commercial bank in terms of deposits, that required the government to finance a bailout. Inflation rates in the last five years, as measured by this index, were 1.7% in 2016, 4.2% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018, 3.7% in 2019 and 5.6% in 2020. DOP has also been subject to volatility in the past and could be subject to significant fluctuations in the future given the prevalence of a free float exchange regime. The main drivers of exchange rate volatility in recent years have been significant fluctuations in commodity prices as well as general uncertainty and trade imbalances in regional and global markets. The value of DOP against the U.S. dollar may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, which may negatively impact the strength of the Dominican Republic’s economy and therefore adversely affect demand for our products and services. The Dominican Republic also has significant external public debt and in the past has been required to restructure such debt, including in 1991 and 2005. In addition, the Dominican Republic is facing an on-going crisis in the electricity sector. Electricity generators and distributors have been beset by financial problems that have resulted in frequent blackouts, widespread public protests and several temporary and permanent shutdowns of generating plants. As a consequence, the government has nationalized the three distribution companies and is regularly required to partially finance the current deficit of the electricity distributors. This crisis could have a material adverse impact on the Dominican Republic’s economic growth, the penetration rate for telecommunication services and the non-availability or higher prices of electricity could directly impact our business and the businesses of our customers. In addition, we have been in the past, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory customer compensation obligations as a result of network shutdowns due to electricity blackouts that are beyond our control. ----- Each of these factors could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Altice Dominicana’s business, reputation, financial conditions or result of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The Trade and Cooperation",13.3.44,,"Agreement had been applied provisionally since January 1, 2021 subject to formal approval by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The European Parliament approved it on April 28, 2021 and the Trade and Cooperation Agreement is now effective. While it is difficult to predict the effect of Brexit on the European and global economy, uncertainty regarding new or modified arrangements between the U.K. and the EU could result in additional volatility in the markets, increased costs and a material adverse effect on the buying behavior of commercial and individual customers. Brexit has created substantial political uncertainty within the EU, uncertainty in international financial markets and reduced economic growth in certain jurisdictions. It is possible that members of the European monetary union could hold similar referendums regarding their membership within the Eurozone in the future. The realization of these concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the European monetary union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely, which could result in the redenomination of a portion or, in the extreme case, all of the Group’s euro-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows to the new currency of the country in which they originated. This could result in a mismatch in the currencies of the Group’s assets, liabilities and cash flows. Any such mismatch, together with the capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such redenomination event, could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination event would likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the Eurozone countries, which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our products and, accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows. Further, since we rely on access to the financial markets in order to refinance our debt liabilities and gain access to new financing, ongoing political uncertainty and any worsening of the economic environment may reduce our ability to refinance our existing and future liabilities or gain access to new financing, in each case on favorable ----- terms or at all. Furthermore, our counterparties may not be able to fulfil their obligations under their respective agreements due to a lack of liquidity, operational failure, bankruptcy or other reasons. Moreover, any changes from euro to non-euro currencies in countries in which we operate would require us to modify our billing and other financial systems. No assurance can be given that any required modifications could be made within a timeframe that would allow us to timely bill our customers or prepare and file required financial reports. In light of the significant exposure that we have to the euro through our euro-denominated borrowings, derivative instruments, cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination event could have a material adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, continued hostilities in the Middle East and North Africa could adversely affect the Israeli economy. Additionally, the economy of the Dominican Republic depends to a significant degree on global tourism and the health of the U.S. economy and remains vulnerable to external shocks (e.g. economic declines in other emerging market countries). Any decrease in visitors, downturns in the U.S. economy or other similar external shocks could have a material adverse effect on economic growth in the Dominican Republic. Environmental factors, such as disruptions due to natural disasters, have in the past and may in the future have an adverse effect on the economies of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the Dominican Republic. Negative macroeconomic and political conditions could also adversely affect access to capital and increase the cost of capital. As a result of disruptions in the credit markets, many lenders may increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, require more restrictive terms (including higher collateral ratios for advances, shorter maturities and smaller loan amounts) or refuse to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to pre-crisis conditions. Changes in interest rates and exchange rates may also adversely affect the fair value of our assets and liabilities. If there is a negative impact on the fair values of our assets and liabilities, we could be required to record impairment charges. Negative macroeconomic developments in the markets in which we operate, in particular increasing levels of unemployment, may have a direct negative impact on the spending patterns of retail consumers, both in terms of the products they subscribe for and usage levels. Because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from residential subscribers who may be impacted by these conditions, it may be more difficult to attract new subscribers and more likely that certain of our subscribers will downgrade or disconnect their services. In addition, we can provide no assurances that a deterioration of any of these economies will not lead to a higher number of non-paying customers or generally result in service disconnections. Similarly, a deterioration in economic conditions would be likely to adversely affect the demand for, and pricing of, our business services as a result of businesses and governments reducing spending. Therefore, a weak economy and negative economic development in the markets in which we operate may jeopardize our growth targets and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, adverse economic conditions (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) may lead to a rise in the number of our customers who are not able to pay for our services.

Such regulation and supervision, as well as future changes in laws or regulations or in their interpretation or enforcement that affect us, our competitors or our industry, strongly influence how we operate our business. Complying with existing and future law and regulations may increase our operational and administrative expenses, restrict our ----- ability or make it more difficult to implement price increases, affect our ability to introduce new services, force us to change our marketing and other business practices, and/or otherwise limit our revenues. In particular, our business could be materially and adversely affected by any changes in relevant laws or regulations (or in their interpretation) regarding, for example, licensing requirements, access and price regulation, interconnection arrangements or the imposition of universal service obligations, or any change in policy allowing more favorable conditions for other operators or increasing competition. There can be no assurance to you that the provision of our services will not be subject to greater regulation in the future. Furthermore, a failure to comply with the applicable rules and regulations could result in penalties, restrictions on our business or loss of required licenses or other adverse consequences. Although the regulations applicable to our businesses vary depending on jurisdiction, such regulations may include, amongst other things: - in certain jurisdictions, price regulation for certain of the services we offer, exit fees and cancellation charges; - rules governing the interconnection between different telephone networks and the interconnection rates that we can charge and that we pay; - requirements that, under specified circumstances, a cable system carry certain broadcast stations or obtain consent to carry a broadcast station; - rules for authorizations, licensing, acquisitions, renewals and transfers of licenses and franchises; - requirements that we provide or contribute to the provision of certain universal services; - rules and regulations relating to subscriber privacy and data protection; - rules and regulations relating to our networks, including universal access obligations imposed on us, coinstallation and co-location obligations (including our submarine cable landing stations), right of way and ownership considerations; - rules governing the copyright royalties; - requirements on portability; and - other requirements covering a variety of operational areas such as equal employment opportunity, emergency alert systems, disability access, technical standards, environmental standards, city planning rules and customer service and consumer protection requirements. The regulations applicable to our operations within the EU often derive from EU Directives. The various Directives require EU Member States to harmonize their laws on communications and cover such issues as access, user rights, privacy and competition. These Directives are reviewed by the EU from time to time and any changes to them could lead to substantial changes in the way in which our businesses in the relevant jurisdictions are regulated and to which we would have to adapt. In Israel, we are also subject to, among other things, regulations requiring us to maintain structural separation between our cable television, broadband internet infrastructure access and fixed-line telephony, and between our ISP and mobile subsidiaries, regulations restricting the number of channels we can own and specifying the minimum investment we are required to make in local content productions and requirements that we extend our cable television, broadband internet infrastructure access and fixed-line telephony services to areas of Israel even where it is not economically profitable to do so. In July 2019, the Ministry of Communications decided to enable us to provide our services in areas without cable infrastructure using technological alternatives, on a technological neutrality basis. The Israeli Ministry of Communications has taken active steps to increase competition in the fixed-line and mobile telecommunications industries, including providing licenses to MVNOs and eliminating termination fees that operators can charge, except in limited circumstances, and prohibiting the linkage of the price and terms of handsets to the services or benefits of the mobile contract. The Israeli Ministry of Communications has also introduced a policy for the establishment of a wholesale market for broadband internet infrastructure access pursuant to which certain limitations on structural separation and bundling of products may be reduced, but we would also be required to provide access to our network infrastructure to other service providers on a wholesale basis. In June 2020, the Israeli Ministry of Communications allowed HOT to offer ----- packages including our triple-play services together with HOT Net’s ISP services, subject to certain conditions. In February 2021, the Israeli Ministry of Communications published a decision allowing us to offer HOT Mobile’s mobile services in our multi-play service packages as well, subject to the prior approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications. On May 30, 2021, the Ministry of Communications approved the marketing of quad-play packages including triple-play services with HOT Net’s ISP services and HOT Mobile’s mobile cellular services. Further, in November 2014 the Israeli Ministry of Communications issued regulatory instructions, including the method of setting wholesale service rates and, in the case of Bezeq, the maximum rates that can be collected by Bezeq from other license holders who make use of its infrastructure for the years 2014 to 2018, in an attempt to create a wholesale market for broadband internet infrastructure access and fixed-line telephony services which would allow service providers (such as ISPs, VOB providers and IPTV providers) to provide services to their customers by using our cable network. In June 2017, following a hearing, the Ministry of Communications published the maximum tariffs for supplying wholesale services over HOT Telecom Limited Partmership (“Hot",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Moreover, the regulation introduced measures relating to “net neutrality”. Furthermore, the roaming regulation was completed by other pieces of legislation: - implementing Regulation EU 2016/2286 of December 15, 2016 laying down detailed rules on the application of fair use policy and on the methodology for assessing the sustainability of the abolition of retail roaming surcharges and on the application to be submitted by a roaming provider for the purposes of that assessment; and - Regulation EU 2017/920 of May 17, 2017 amending Regulation (EU) no. 531/2012 with respect to rules for wholesale roaming markets. The EC’s proposals on telecommunications markets presented in September 2016 were intended to fix rules to support the creation of Gigabit Society. The electronic communications code proposal aimed to make investment in very high capacity networks a binding objective and it also aimed to promote sustainable long term competition. It was adopted through Directive 2018/1972 of December 11, 2018 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (the “EECC”), which entered into force on December 20, 2018. This legislation is expected to have an impact on our operations. However, the EECC has not yet been enacted into its national laws by Portugal, but in case the Portuguese law is on the same lines as the EECC, the Group could be impacted by, among other things, reduction of the loyalty periods, introduction of automatic compensation rules when the entity does not meet minimum quality levels related to the reparation of services, new portability rules for the internet service and new information requirements to be provided to customers. _Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 11, 2018 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code._ The EECC was adopted on December 11, 2018 and came into force on December 20, 2018. The EECC brings together the rules on electronic communications networks and services and aligns them with the latest technological developments. The EECC regulates (i) electronic communications networks and electronic communications services (“ECN” and “ECS”), (ii) associated facilities and services, (iii) the authorization of networks and services, (iv) radio spectrum use and numbering resources, (v) access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities and (vi) the protection of end-users. It aims to: - promote connectivity, access to and take-up of very high capacity networks by all citizens and businesses of the EU; - promote competition in the provision of electronic communication networks and services; - contribute to the development of the internal market in the field of electronic communications networks and services, radio spectrum and connectivity; and - promote the interests of European citizens. The EECC has singled out citizen connectivity as a key objective for the EU, since it is instrumental in guaranteeing freedom of expression, pluralism, democracy, culture, social cohesion and even safety. The EECC also adopts a broader definition of ECS to regulate services delivered via internet (known as “overthe-top” or OTT services). ECS now includes internet access services, interpersonal communications services and service consisting wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals. ----- The EECC also provides for strategic planning and coordination of a radio spectrum policy as well as for effective management of radio spectrum by the EU Member States. Finally, national regulation authorities are responsible for ensuring access, interconnection, and the interoperability of services. Consequently, and under certain circumstances, they can impose on undertakings obligations such as interconnecting networks, ensuring the inter-operability of their services and granting physical access to their infrastructure. EU Member States were required to enact the EECC into their national laws by December 21, 2020. As of the date hereof, Portugal has not enacted the EECC into its national laws.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Should the wholesale market develop, certain requirements",13.5.2,The legal status of the Group’s network is complex and in certain cases subject to challenges or renewals.,"The legal status of the Group’s network is complex and the network is mainly governed by public law, which could affect the predictability of the Group’s rights over its network. For a description of the legal status of the Group’s cable network. See “Regulation”. The Group’s telecommunications network is essentially composed of the physical infrastructure (conduits, network head-ends, switches and radio frequency stations) in which telecommunications (mainly cable) equipment is installed. These components of the Group’s network are subject to different legal regimes. As the Group does not own certain land where such physical infrastructures are located and infrastructure is established on public or private property, it has entered into concessions, rights-of-way, leases or even IRUs with the owners of the land. In order to establish a substantial part of its telecommunications network and of its wireless network, the Group has thus entered into public and private property occupancy agreements with public and private entities or holds public property occupancy permits. Under these agreements or permits, the Group may install its network equipment along roads, highways, railways or canals, for example. No transfer of ownership takes place within this framework. Such agreements are entered into for terms that vary greatly, from 3 to 25 years. The Group does not have any right to renewal of such agreements, although the agreements with the shortest terms generally provide for tacit renewal. The Group’s occupancy of public property, as is the case for all occupants of public property, is always precarious and subject to considerations beyond the Group’s control. The public entities with which the Group has entered into these agreements or that have issued permits to it can thus at any time terminate these public property occupancy agreements for misconduct or for reasons of public interest and some of the agreements even exclude any compensation in such case. If the Group fails to obtain such renewal, the company involved would be obliged, upon expiration of these agreements, (i) to return the site to its original condition upon the demand of the manager or owner of the public property involved and/or (ii) to transfer to the latter, in certain cases for the payment of compensation and in certain cases free of charge, ownership of the facilities established on the property involved. If the Group loses all or part of the rights relating to its network, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position, results of operations or outlook of the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

However, many regulatory restrictions and obligations are still imposed on PT OpCo. On October 9, 2014, the EC adopted a new European Relevant Markets Recommendation that replaced the 2007 Recommendation and further reduced the number of relevant markets subject to ex-ante regulation. ANACOM has reanalyzed the retail and wholesale markets identifying which markets are still relevant for regulatory intervention and which electronic communications operators and service providers have significant market power in those markets. The decisions relating to the conclusions of the analysis of markets 3a-3b/2014 (wholesale local and central access at a fixed location) and 4/2014 (wholesale high-quality access at a fixed location) were issued in March 2017 and June 2016, respectively. ANACOM decided not to impose regulatory obligations on PT OpCo’s fiber network, concluding that they would not be proportional. ANACOM’s latest decisions regarding the revision of markets 1/2014 (FTR), 2/2014 (MTR) and 2/2007 (for fixed call origination under the previous recommendation) were issued in October 2018, June 2018 and October 2018, respectively. ANACOM has reanalyzed the markets defined under the European Relevant Market Recommendation and issued findings that PT OpCo had significant market power in these markets, namely the wholesale market for call ----- termination on individual public telephone networks provided at a fixed location, the market for call termination on individual mobile networks, the markets for wholesale local and central access at a fixed location and the market for wholesale high-quality access at a fixed location, in which ANACOM included leased lines trunk segments. In certain cases, such as in markets 3 and 4, ANACOM has segmented the markets into “C” (competitive) and “NC” (non-competitive) segments and issued a finding that PT OpCo had significant market power in the noncompetitive segments, imposing remedies to increase competition in those markets. With respect to market 3, the obligations in ANACOM’s March 2017 decision extended only to the granting of unbundled access to copper loops, ducts and poles at the national level. However, ANACOM required that the duct and poles offers be made on an equivalence of inputs (EoI) basis. ANACOM’s latest decisions in respect of markets 1/2014 (FTR) and 2/2014 (MTR) imposed ex-ante regulatory obligations on PT OpCo; conversely, in its latest decision on market 2/2007, ANACOM decided to end ex-ante regulatory obligations in this market, apart from the maintenance of price control obligations, which ended in March 2020. Recently, the EC adopted a new European Relevant Markets Recommendation that replaced the 2014 Recommendation (EC’s Recommendation of December 18, 2020 (SWD(2020) 337 final)). ANACOM has not yet performed any market analysis in the context of the new European Relevant Markets Recommendation. We receive correspondence from ANACOM from time to time regarding compliance with such and other regulations. If we are found to be in breach of such regulations, the regulators may impose penalties, fines or additional obligations on us to rectify such breaches which may have an adverse effect on our business operations. Remedies imposed by ANACOM may also require PT OpCo to provide services in certain markets or geographic regions or to make investments that it would otherwise not choose to make. In addition, PT OpCo incurred, and may still have to incur, expenses to adapt its operations to changing regulatory requirements and to ensure regulatory compliance. The resources that may be required to fulfill our regulatory obligations in Portugal could adversely affect our ability to compete.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

These authorizations generally require that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, meet certain solvency requirements and maintain minimum levels of service. Should we fail to comply with these, we may be subject to financial penalties from the relevant authorities and there may also be a risk that licenses could be partially or totally withdrawn. The imposition of fines and/or the withdrawal of licenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and prevent us from conducting our business. In addition, such authorizations are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. The procedure for obtaining or renewing these licenses can be long and costly and authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition for renewal. In addition, these licenses may not be obtainable or renewable in a timely manner or at all. In some instances, such authorizations have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without an authorization while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities. Should we not be able to obtain or renew the licenses needed to operate or develop our business in a timely fashion, our ability to realize our strategic objectives may be compromised. In certain cases our mobile licenses require us to comply with certain obligations (population coverage, sharing in certain areas, national roaming) and we may suffer adverse consequences if we are not able to comply with these obligations. In certain countries, we have provided significant bank guarantees to guarantee our performance under our licenses. If we are found to be in material breach of our licenses, the guarantees may be forfeited and our licenses may be revoked. In the Dominican Republic, Altice Dominicana was awarded a concession and is licensed to provide telecommunications services. Altice Dominicana’s concession was originally granted under a concession agreement with the Dominican State in 1996 and was due to expire on August 1, 2015. Altice Dominicana presented a formal renewal request to Indotel on April 27, 2015. This concession was de facto renewed, as all of the criteria for renewal were met by Altice Dominicana. In addition, Altice Dominicana currently holds a number of frequency license certificates issued by Indotel. These licenses have also been de facto renewed, as all of the criteria for renewal were met by Altice Dominicana. Indotel called for a renegotiation of our concession agreement ----- in the first quarter of 2021 and negotiations are ongoing. As per the concession agreement, concessions can be terminated by Altice Dominicana, or an agreement between Altice Dominicana and Indotel in the event of bankruptcy, or upon Altice Dominicana being found guilty of committing multiple grave faults (as defined in the agreement). We make no assurances that our concession or licenses will continue to be renewed in the future. Furthermore, certain regulatory approvals, such as new build permits, may be required for Altice Dominicana to operate antenna sites with other frequencies/frequency bands, in particular where the shift is made from a higher frequency band (e.g. 1800 MHz) to a lower frequency band (e.g. 900 MHz). To the extent that Altice Dominicana seeks to operate antenna sites with other frequencies/frequency bands in the future, failure to obtain such regulatory approvals could have a negative impact on the coverage of its network. If Indotel does not continue to renew Altice Dominicana’s concession or frequency licenses or if Altice Dominicana fails to obtain any regulatory approvals that are required, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The acquisition of licenses also represents a high cost, the timing of which varies depending on when the frequencies involved are auctioned. Furthermore, this cost could rise due to strong competitive pressure in the telecommunications field. If we fail to obtain or retain, in a timely manner, the licenses necessary for performing, continuing or developing our activities, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives could be subjected to alteration. In addition, we may fail to be awarded the desired licenses, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or outlook.

Since 2010, the Executive Power issued Decree 520-11 and Indotel has issued a series of resolutions in order to implement the National Frequency Allocation Plan (“PNAF”), the objective of which is to reorganize the radio spectrum in the Dominican Republic and make more bands available for operators to provide mobile services. As a result of the PNAF, Altice Dominicana has in the past migrated, and may in the future be required to migrate from one frequency to another allocated to it by Indotel, which may result in disputes among the various telecom operators as to spectrum entitlement rights relating to the migrated bands. On January 23, 2019, Indotel ordered the beginning of a public consultation process to amend the PNAF. On March 6, 2019, Indotel issued a Resolution (No. 013-19) ordering the reorganization of frequency allocations allocating 3460-3490 MHz to Altice Dominicana.

The cost of complying with TAMA 36 can be substantial and there is currently a regulatory process underway to amend TAMA 36 which would place substantial limitations and further increase the cost of erecting our UMTS/LTE network. In addition, the local loop of our networks is generally located aboveground. Local municipal governments generally have the authority to require us to move these network lines underground. Usually, we are able to coordinate with other utility suppliers to share the costs associated with moving lines underground but no assurance can be given that we will always be able to do so.

These difficulties could have an adverse effect on the coverage, quality and capacity of our mobile network.","Our ability to maintain and improve the extent, quality and capacity of our mobile network coverage in Israel depends in part on our ability to obtain appropriate sites and approvals to install our mobile network infrastructure, including mobile network sites. The erection and operation of most of these mobile network sites require building permits from local or regional planning and building authorities, as well as a number of additional permits from other governmental and regulatory authorities. In addition, as part of our UMTS/LTE network build-out, we are erecting additional mobile network sites and making modifications to our existing mobile network sites for which we may be required to obtain new consents and approvals. For the reasons described in further detail below, we have had difficulties obtaining some of the building permits required for the erection and operation of our mobile network sites. In addition, as we seek to improve the range and quality of our mobile telephony services, we need to further expand our mobile network, and difficulties in obtaining required permits may delay, increase costs or prevent us from achieving these goals in full. Our inability to resolve these issues in a timely manner could also prevent us from achieving or maintaining the mobile network coverage and quality requirements contained in our license. Since June 2002, following the approval of TAMA 36, which regulates network site construction and operation, building permits for our mobile network sites (where required) have been issued in reliance on TAMA 36. We have set up several hundred small communications devices, called wireless access devices, pursuant to a provision in the Planning and Construction Law, which exempts such devices from the need to obtain a building permit. A claim was raised that the exemption does not apply to mobile communications devices and the matter reached first instance courts a number of times, resulting in conflicting decisions. In May 2008, a district court ruling adopted the position that the exemption does not apply to wireless access devices. The mobile telephone operators filed a request to appeal this ruling to the Supreme Court. In May 2008, the Israeli Attorney General filed an opinion regarding this matter stating that the exemption applies to wireless radio access devices under certain conditions. Subsequently, two petitions were filed with the High Court of Justice in opposition to the Israeli Attorney General’s opinion. In September 2010, adopting the position of the Israeli Attorney General, the Israeli Supreme Court issued an interim order prohibiting further construction of radio access devices for mobile networks in reliance on the exemption mentioned above. In September 2011, the Supreme Court permitted HOT Mobile and Golan Telecom to use the exemption in order to erect their new UMTS networks until December 31, 2013, provided, however, that no more than 40% of the facilities that the operator erects are within the jurisdiction of any municipality, an affidavit is submitted in advance to the municipality’s engineer and the safety zone does not exceed four meters and does not deviate from the boundaries of the lot. On August 28, 2013, we submitted a formal request with the Israeli Supreme Court, requesting a renewal of the exemption. On September 30, 2013, we received a response from the Supreme Court stating that they had requested a formal reply from the state on this subject matter. On October 1, 2013, the Israeli Supreme Court passed a decree nisi in relation to the petition to which the State filed a response on December 17, 2013, requesting a perpetual injunction to prevent the erecting of access network devices until legislation was put in place by the Israeli Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Communication to regulate this matter. In its response, the State further claimed that the exemption relating to the erecting of access network devices for HOT Mobile and Golan Telecom should only be valid until June 30, 2014. The Supreme Court has not passed judgment on this, however, and until a final decision has been passed by the Supreme Court, HOT Mobile will be allowed to continue the deployment of its UMTS/LTE network. In March 2016, the Supreme Court permitted HOT Mobile and Partner to make several adjustments to their existing access devices in order to enable the companies to operate their joint network. On December 23, 2018, the Supreme Court gave a verdict rejecting the appeal, due to new bylaws issued by the Minister of Interior Affairs, regulating the conditions for exemptions granted for construction of radio access devices for mobile networks. Further, the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection notified us of a new condition for all of our 3G/4G mobile network site operation permits, according to which we must install systems software (provided by the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection) that continuously monitors and reports the level of power created in real time from the operation of our 3G/4G mobile network sites (the “Monitoring System”). Since May 2012, we started erecting our new UMTS/LTE cell sites according to construction permits received in November 2011. We have also made practical examinations to all our new UMTS/LTE cell sites. All of the examinations showed ----- that our new UMTS/LTE cell sites comply with the safety standard determined by the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection. As of August 2012, we began to apply requests for operation permits to our sites to the Commissioner. We also applied to the Commissioner for extended time to connect to the monitoring system. As of November 2012, we started receiving operation permits, which are subject to the demand to connect to the monitoring system no later than February 5, 2013. On February 4, 2013, we were notified by the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection that we have complied with all of its requirements for connecting to the monitoring system. Our mobile network has since been transferred to, and is currently the responsibility of, PHI. See “Description of Our Business—Significant Contracts—Israel—Mobile Network Sharing Agreement with Partner _in Israel” for more information._ We believe that all of the antennas that we operate comply with the conditions of the safety permits that we were granted by the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection. However, if our antennas are found to not meet the conditions of the permits granted to us and the maximum permitted power, the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection may revoke existing permits, which would require us to dismantle existing mobile network sites. As a result, our network capacity and coverage would be negatively impacted, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Under the Non-Ionizing Radiation Law, 2006, the National Council for Planning and Building requires indemnification undertakings from mobile companies as a precondition for obtaining a building permit for new or existing mobile network sites. The National Council has decided that until the Plan is amended to reflect a different indemnification amount, mobile companies will be required to undertake to indemnify the committees in full against all losses resulting from claims against a committee for reductions in property values as a result of granting a permit to the mobile network site. On June 1, 2010, the National Council for Planning and Building approved the National Building Plan No. 36/A/1 version that incorporates all of the amendments to the Plan (the “Amended Plan”). The Amended Plan is subject to government approval in accordance with the Planning and Building Law. We have several indemnification letters outstanding to local planning and building committees, although no claims have been filed against us under such letters. Calls upon our indemnification letters may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In 2007, the Israeli Ministry of Interior Affairs extended the limitation period within which depreciation claims may be brought under the Planning and Building Law from three years from approval of the building plan to the later of (i) one year from receiving a building permit for a mobile network site under the Plan and (ii) six months from the construction of a mobile network site. The Israeli Ministry retains the general authority to extend such period further.

In September 2019, the Ministry of Communications relaxed the requirements for structural separation within the HOT group relating to the business sector, which enables HOT to provide certain customers in the business sector with broadband internet infrastructure access and mobile telephony services. In addition, following a hearing published in 2014, the Ministry of Communications gave notice in August 2017 of a further hearing regarding the mechanism to examine retail offers made by HOT and Bezeq to new or existing subscribers, to avoid ‘margin squeeze’ practices but no decision was made in this respect. In October 2015, the Minister of Communications appointed an advisory committee to advise on the regulation of the broadcast market. In February 2016, the advisory committee published a report setting out its recommendations in relation to regulations that will apply to new and existing operators in the broadcasting area, regulations that will apply with respect to the commercial channels, the investments rates in local productions and other issues. On June 30, 2016, the Ministry of Communications published the committee’s final report. In addition, in March 2016, the Cable & Satellite Broadcasting Council published a decision with respect to a new policy regarding setting tariffs and offerings of HOT. This policy may limit our ability to increase prices in existing plans. Furthermore, in December 2019, the Ministry of Communications published for review and hearing, updated regulations governing maximum tariffs for wholesale BSA services on HOT’s network in 2019-2022. According to the hearing, the Ministry is considering a change in the method for determining the maximum tariffs, from a cost-reflected model to a “retail minus” model, due to the Ministry’s claim that HOT used “margin squeeze” practices in its retail pricing. In June 2020, within the scope of the Israeli Ministry of Communications’ decision to enable HOT to offer service bundles including HOT Net’s ISP services, the Israeli Ministry of Communications approved HOT’s proposal regarding new wholesale tariffs in its network as an alternative for the hearing. Further, on July 10, 2018, the Ministry of Communications proposed certain amendments to the current regulations governing the multichannel TV market, in order to adapt to recent technological changes in the market. Such proposed regulations will apply to audio-visual content providers that attain a certain market share, with the goal of encouraging competition and reducing the regulatory burden. In October 2020, a committee appointed by the Minister of Communications published a public hearing regarding the future macro-regulation of the broadcasting market in Israel, including with respect to reduction of regulation, local productions, regulators’ structure, economic models in the market, regulating sports broadcasting and ratings measurement. HOT submitted its position, according to which, the regulation should be equal and technologically neutral. In addition, we are subject to antitrust rules and regulations and are, from time to time, subject to review by authorities concerning whether we exhibit monopoly power in any of the market in which we operate. To the extent that we are deemed by relevant authorities to exhibit significant market power, we can be subject to various regulatory obligations adversely affecting our results of operations and profitability. Regulatory authorities may also require us to grant third parties access to our bandwidth, frequency capacity, facilities or services to distribute their own services or resell our services to end customers. Currently, we are considered to have significant market power with respect to certain services in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic. No assurance can be given that we will not be identified as having significant market power in any relevant markets in the future and that we will not be subject to additional regulatory requirements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Such broad rights (such as in the GNU General Public License) are usually subject to the requirement that users not place any additional restrictions on access to the source code in any onward distribution of the software, and that such onward licensing be on the original license terms. OSS is commonly viewed as having two major risks. First, the OSS license usually also covers onward distributions of derivative works (based on the original OSS), with the result that proprietary software integrated with the OSS becomes “infected” and the entire integrated software program (OSS and proprietary software components) is covered by the OSS license. One notable result of this is that the publisher or distributor of the derivative work would have to make available the source code of the entire work, including the proprietary software portions. The second commonly viewed risk is that OSS software is usually licensed “as is” without any contractual warranties. As a result, the Group would bear the risks in the event of defects with any OSS that it utilizes in its products and services without necessarily having any contractual recourse. Further, if the Group integrates OSS into any of the software that it publishes or distributes, then our use of OSS could have an impact on the ownership of the intellectual property in such software, particularly in terms of exclusivity, as the refusal to disclose any modifications made could be characterized as an infringement of the OSS license.

Next Private may allocate certain of its risks to the Issuer or the Group and the Issuer cannot assure you that Next Private will permit the Group to pursue certain business opportunities. As a result of its controlling position, Next Private has, directly or indirectly, the power, among other things, to affect the Group’s legal and capital structure and day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change the Group’s management and to approve any other changes to the Group’s strategy, structure and operations.

In addition, Next Private has, directly or indirectly, the power to control the Group’s abilities to enter into any corporate transaction and prevent any transaction that requires the approval of the shareholders, regardless of whether the holders of the Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. Next Private could exercise such power to cause us to incur additional indebtedness or sell certain material assets, in each case, so long as the Group’s debt instruments and the Intercreditor Agreement permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the Group’s debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce our ability to generate revenues, each of which could adversely affect the holders of the Notes.

In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation, administration, reorganization or other insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding of any non-Guarantor subsidiary, holders of their debt (including any intercompany loans to such subsidiaries) and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity.

The value of the Senior Secured Collateral and the amounts to be received upon a sale of such Senior Secured Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell any or all of Altice International’s subsidiaries’ shares in an ordinary sale and the availability of buyers. Although the Notes will indirectly benefit from collateral securing certain intercompany debt (including collateral security the HOT Proceeds Notes) through the assignment of such intercompany debt, the Notes will not have a direct benefit of such collateral and the Security Agent will be unable to enforce over such collateral except if an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the relevant intercompany debt. See “—The guarantees of, and the collateral securing, certain _intercompany debt that is pledged to secure our Senior Secured Debt, including the Notes and Guarantees thereof, will not directly secure the Notes”._ Certain Senior Secured Collateral and Guarantees will be limited to an agreed maximum amount. Under the Aggregate Portuguese Security and Guarantee Limit, the maximum aggregate amount of obligations (i) guaranteed by Altice Portugal and (ii) secured by the pledge over the shares in PT Portugal, which limitation applies to all indebtedness so guaranteed and/or secured by Altice Portugal on an aggregate basis, is €95 million. The maximum amount of obligations secured or guaranteed by PT Portugal will be €4,634 million and PT OpCo €968 million.

No appraisal of the fair market value of the Senior Secured Collateral has been made in connection with this offering of Notes. The book value of the Senior Secured Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. The value of the Senior Secured Collateral could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic and market conditions, our failure to successfully implement our business strategy, competition and other factors. The Senior Secured Collateral may include intangible or other illiquid assets that by their nature may not have a readily ascertainable market value, whose value to other parties may be less than its value to us, or may not be readily saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in their liquidation. In addition, the value of the Senior Secured Collateral may decrease because of obsolescence, impairment or certain casualty events. ----- In the event of a liquidation, insolvency, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, the proceeds from the sale of the Senior Secured Collateral that secures the Notes and the guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees. The value of the Senior Secured Collateral and the amount that may be received upon a sale of Senior Secured Collateral will depend upon many factors including, among others, the condition of the Senior Secured Collateral and our industry, the ability to sell the Senior Secured Collateral in an orderly sale, market and economic conditions, whether the business is sold as a going concern, the availability of buyers and other factors. In addition, the Senior Secured Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market. With respect to any shares of Altice International’s subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, winding up or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, courts could limit recoverability with respect to the Senior Secured Collateral if they deem a portion of the interest claim usurious in violation of applicable public policy. As a result, liquidating the Senior Secured Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Notes. We cannot assure you of the value of the Senior Secured Collateral or that the net proceeds received upon a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding would be sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes. If the proceeds of Senior Secured Collateral were not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the Notes, then holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Senior Secured Collateral) would only have an unsecured claim against our remaining assets. See “—It may be difficult to realize _the value of the Senior Secured Collateral securing the Notes”._ The Senior Secured Collateral also secures the other Senior Secured Debt. The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the relevant Senior Secured Collateral securing the Notes, including in respect of certain future indebtedness. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy such liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the security documents governing the Senior Secured Collateral, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Secured Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes, to the extent such Notes are secured by such Senior Secured Collateral. Moreover, if the Issuer issues additional Notes under the Indenture or the Altice Financing Indentures, holders of such additional Notes would benefit from the same Senior Secured Collateral as the holders of the Notes, thereby diluting the holders’ ability to benefit from the liens on the Senior Secured Collateral securing the Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of an enforcement of the Senior Secured Collateral securing the Notes, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Senior Secured Collateral only after the lenders under the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging agreements have been repaid in full.

As a consequence, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests (other than Senior Secured Collateral governed by Portuguese Law deemed to have been granted directly in favor of the secured creditors) and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Senior Secured Collateral, except through the Security Agent, who ----- will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Senior Secured Collateral. The appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law, (i) to the extent that the designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions, depending on the type of the security interests. Generally, according to article 2(4) of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the “Collateral Act 2005”), a security (financial collateral) may be provided in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral taker, a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of third party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis à vis third party beneficiaries of the security, persons acting on behalf of beneficiaries of the security, the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of the security aimed at by such law. The security documents governing the granting of the Senior Secured Collateral will be governed by the laws of a number of jurisdictions. Bankruptcy laws could prevent the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes from repossessing and disposing of the Senior Secured Collateral upon the occurrence of an event of default if a bankruptcy proceeding is commenced by or against the relevant grantor of such Senior Secured Collateral before the Security Agent repossesses and disposes of the Senior Secured Collateral.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the lenders under the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging agreements will have priority over the holders of the Notes with respect to the proceeds from the enforcement of the Senior Secured Collateral. In addition, the creditors under the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging agreements will have priority over any amounts received from the sale of any assets of the Issuer or the Guarantors pursuant to an insolvency event or certain other distressed disposals of the Senior Secured Collateral pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. As such, you may not be able to recover on the Senior Secured Collateral if the claims of the lenders under the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging agreements are greater than the proceeds realized from any enforcement of the security interests over the Senior Secured Collateral. In addition, the Senior Secured Collateral may also secure certain future indebtedness that is permitted to be incurred under the Indenture and our other existing debt agreements, and certain of that indebtedness may have similar priority to the proceeds of the enforcement of, or certain distressed disposals of, the Senior Secured Collateral as described above with respect to the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Senior Secured Collateral by any creditor will, after all obligations under the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations have been paid from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and other senior indebtedness secured on such Senior Secured Collateral, including the Altice Financing Notes, the Altice Financing Term Loans and the Altice Financing Guarantee Facilities.

The Senior Secured Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture, the Altice Financing Indentures and/or the Intercreditor Agreement. The Initial Purchasers have neither analyzed the effect of, nor participated in any negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Senior Secured Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Senior Secured Collateral. Furthermore, the first-ranking ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, before the pledge over the shares and other material assets of Altice Dominicana will secure the Notes, Indotel will need to approve both the granting of the security as well as the enforceability of such security. We cannot assure you that such approval will be granted. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Senior Secured Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party, including that of competent regulatory authorities or courts, to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Senior Secured Collateral may significantly decrease. Furthermore, enforcement procedures and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in Portugal, Luxembourg, Israel, the Dominican Republic and the United Kingdom may be materially more complex and time consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. See “—Enforcing your rights as a _holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or security across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult or provide less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law”. In particular, the enforcement and realization of any security interest_ under the Senior Secured Collateral which is governed by Israeli law will be subject to the supervision of the Israeli courts or the Israeli Office of Execution of Judgments and their practices. Enforcement and realization of security interests in Israel is subject to certain mandatory principles. The general rule under Israeli law is that any enforcement or realization of a fixed pledge or charge or a floating charge is required to be made in accordance with and subject to a court order, with certain exceptions for collateral deposited with the creditor, collateral with respect to which the law specifies another manner of realization and collateral which consists of rights. See “— _Rights of holders of Notes to enforce, secure and realize their rights under the Senior Secured Collateral may be adversely affected in Israeli insolvency proceedings”. Furthermore, enforcement or realization of rights with_ respect to the pledges of the shares of Cool Holding and Hadaros is subject to the prior approval of and supervision by the Israeli Ministry of Communications and enforcement or realization of rights with respect to the pledges of the shares of Altice Dominicana is subject to the prior approval of Indotel, in each case which may be time consuming and cumbersome.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The liens on the Senior Secured Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees, as the case may be, if the Security Agent is not able to or does not take the actions necessary to perfect or maintain the perfection of any such liens. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Senior Secured Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, as applicable, or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of such debt against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Senior Secured Collateral. In addition, applicable law may require that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will monitor, or that we will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Senior Secured Collateral, and that all necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after acquired collateral. The Security Agent does not have any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional ----- property or rights that should constitute Senior Secured Collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps to perfect, any security interest therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the Senior Secured Collateral or adversely affect the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes and the Guarantees against third parties including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who may claim a secured interest in any part of the Senior Secured Collateral.

Only the security agent or lender thereunder (as applicable) will be able to enforce the security interests in the collateral securing the HOT Proceeds Notes in accordance with its terms, including in certain cases upon the occurrence of an event of default that is continuing under such intercompany indebtedness. As a result, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Notes, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes may not have the right to enforce such security interests in the collateral securing such intercompany indebtedness (including the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral) and will only have the right to enforce the first-ranking pledge over such intercompany indebtedness. The holders of the Notes must then rely on the ability of the Issuer to enforce its rights under the HOT Proceeds Notes upon an event of default thereunder (as applicable) in order to access such collateral. An event of default under the Notes may not result in an event of default under the HOT Proceeds Notes. Moreover, the borrowers and guarantors under such intercompany indebtedness will not have any liability to the holders of the Notes in an event of default under the Indenture, ----- except to the extent they are Guarantors. However, if an event of default occurs and is continuing under the HOT Proceeds Notes, holders of the Notes will indirectly benefit to the extent the Issuer or a Guarantor is a lender under or purchaser of the HOT Proceeds Notes. This indirect claim over the collateral securing the HOT Proceeds Notes could delay or make more costly any realization of such collateral.

The dual nationality of Cool Holding may impact the ability to enforce the pledges over the share capital of Cool Holding depending on whether enforcement will be sought under the Luxembourg law pledges or under the Israeli law pledges, as enforcement formalities and requirements under these laws may differ. Likewise, there may be limited recognition by a Luxembourg court or an Israeli court of an enforcement of the pledges of the share capital of Cool Holding when performed in the respective other jurisdiction, because each court will consider that, in accordance with its own international private law rules, the pledges should have been enforced in its own jurisdiction and in accordance with its own governing laws, rather than those of the other jurisdiction.

See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the _Security Interests”._ Enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Guarantor, or of the security interests in respect thereof, will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) void or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the security interests in respect thereof, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the relevant Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee; - the relevant Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee and such Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed financial assistance rules or the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or ----- - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to the holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or - it cannot pay its debts as they become due. The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee that has not been declared void.

The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control triggering event itself does not. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control triggering event may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control triggering event occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from repurchasing Notes, we may be required to seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Altice International and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer may proceed under, and be governed by, Luxembourg insolvency laws. The rights of the holders of the Notes and the responsibilities of the Issuer to the holders of the Notes under Luxembourg law may be materially different from those with regard to equivalent instruments under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Notes are offered. Additionally, the insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to the holders of the Notes as insolvency laws of jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency laws in Luxembourg. Under Luxembourg insolvency laws, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be opened against the Issuer to the extent that the Issuer has its registered office or center of main interest in Luxembourg: - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the Issuer, by any of its creditors or by the Luxembourg public prosecutor. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings, if the Issuer (a) is in default of payment (cessation de paiements) and (b) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a court considers that these conditions are met, it may open bankruptcy proceedings, absent a request made by the Issuer or a creditor. The main effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the Issuer except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for secured creditors, and the payment of creditors in accordance with their rank upon the realization of assets; - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested by the Issuer and not by its creditors; and - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), the opening of which may only be requested by the Issuer (having received prior consent of a majority of its creditors) and not by its creditors. The court’s decision to admit a company to the composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by unsecured creditors. In addition to these proceedings, the ability of the holders of the Notes to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of a court to grant a reprieve from payments (sursis de paiements) or to put the Issuer into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious violation of the commercial code or of the Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to bankruptcy proceedings. The Issuer’s liabilities in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the Issuer following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those of the Issuer’s debts that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law for instance include, among others: - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue; - value added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise; - social security contributions; and - remuneration owed to employees. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized). During insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. The ability of secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited in the event of controlled management proceedings automatically causing the rights of secured creditors to be frozen until a final decision has been taken ----- by the court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the Issuer’s liabilities in order to take effect. The Collateral Act 2005 expressly provides that all financial collateral arrangements (including pledges) including enforcement measures are valid and enforceable even if entered into during the pre-bankruptcy period, against all third parties including supervisors, receivers, liquidators and any other similar persons or bodies irrespective of any bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation, national or foreign, of composition with creditors or reorganization affecting anyone of the parties, save in the case of fraud. Generally, Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer during the pre-bankruptcy hardening period (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months and the 10 days preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date. In particular: - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, some specific transactions (in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts, save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Collateral Act 2005; the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt’s cessation of payments; - pursuant to article 21 (2) of the Collateral Act 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, notwithstanding the suspect period as referred to in articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered into on the date of the commencement of a reorganization measure or winding up proceedings, but after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, that agreement is enforceable and binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar organs if the collateral taker proves that it ignored the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it; and - pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the civil code (action _paulienne) the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent_ payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit. In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of contracts except for _intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the insolvency receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts. However, as of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis á vis the bankruptcy estate. The bankruptcy order provides for a period of time during which creditors must file their claims with the clerk’s office of the Luxembourg district court sitting in commercial matters. After having converted all available assets of the company into cash and after having determined all the company’s liabilities, the insolvency receiver will distribute the proceeds of the sale, on a pro rata basis, to the creditors after deduction of the receiver fees and the bankruptcy administration costs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.9,"45-20”), which entered into effect on December 21, 2020, the Dominican Republic adopted new legislation",13.9.7,"Rights of holders of Notes to enforce, secure and realize their rights under the Senior Secured Collateral may be adversely affected in Israeli insolvency proceedings.","The ability of the holders of Notes to enforce, secure and realize their rights under the Senior Secured Collateral may be delayed, restricted, subordinated, completely terminated or otherwise adversely affected in any insolvency proceedings conducted under Israeli jurisdiction or subject to Israeli law. Israeli insolvency law generally favors the continuation of a business over immediate payment of creditors. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect rights of secured creditors generally and in insolvency proceedings particularly: ----- - Fraudulent conveyance principles and other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights and remedies generally and by application by a competent court of equitable principles. Under Israeli law, any transfer of asset or creation of a security interest by a debtor may be declared not enforceable in liquidation, reorganization or composition proceedings of the debtor if, generally, the following conditions are met: (a) the debtor is deemed insolvent (as defined in and construed under Israeli law principles) at the time of the conveyance; (b) the conveyance is effected in the three months prior to the commencement of the liquidation or reorganization proceedings; and (c) the conveyance is made by the debtor with the intention of fraudulently preferring a certain creditor or as a result of illegal coercion or persuasion by the creditor. A specific fraudulent conveyance rule applies to security interests created under a floating charge. Under Israeli law, a floating charge created during the six months prior to the start of the liquidation, reorganization or composition proceedings may be construed as invalid as to the indebtedness secured thereunder and not advanced by the creditor holding the floating charge at the creation of the pledge or immediately thereafter (together with interest at the rate set by law), unless sufficient proof exists to support the fact that the debtor was solvent immediately following the creation of the floating charge. - The issuance of a liquidation order by a court of competent authority in respect of a company results in a stay of proceedings. Upon the issuance of the liquidation order, creditors of a company are prohibited from taking any action against the company or its assets to secure or realize their rights, and any such proceedings not completed are stayed. However, the liquidation order does not prevent creditors holding a secured interest from enforcing and realizing their collateral or to otherwise use it in a different manner (although the enforcement process may be procedurally limited in a certain manner). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a court of competent authority may order a moratorium on proceedings against a company for a period of up to nine months (and may extend that period for additional three month periods (without limitation as to the aggregate time frame), for special reasons) if the court is convinced that the moratorium may contribute to the formation of a compromise or arrangement between the company, its shareholders and its creditors. Secured creditors are restricted from enforcing their collateral during the moratorium period, unless the court is convinced that either (i) no adequate protection exists to safeguard the secured creditors’ rights or (ii) enforcement of the secured creditor’s rights will not jeopardize the ability of the company to duly form and approve the arrangement or compromise so contemplated. - Claims and rights of creditors of a company in insolvency proceedings may abate in whole or in part due to insufficient funds and assets of the company in insolvency. Generally, the distribution of assets in insolvency proceedings is governed by two core principles: the principle of absolute superiority, according to which creditors of a certain class, who rank higher in priority to other creditors, will be permitted to satisfy their interests in full prior to creditors of a different class, who rank lower in priority, and the principle of absolute equality, according to which creditors of the same class will have a pro rata right to secure and satisfy their interest with other creditors of the same class. Generally, subject to certain exceptions, creditors holding a fixed pledge or charge rank higher in priority to shareholders and other unsecured creditors of a company and may, subject to the limitations described above, proceed in enforcing their security interest without interference. Such creditors are entitled to use the proceeds received in connection with the realization of their security interest to satisfy their entire claim but will be treated as unsecured creditors with respect to any portion of their claim not entirely satisfied by the proceeds so received if such proceeds are insufficient to repay their entire interest. Creditors holding a fixed pledge or charge may, however, be subordinated to (i) certain creditors statutorily preferred under Israeli law (e.g. tax authorities holding a tax lien in respect of taxes owed and not paid on real estate property of the company); (ii) certain creditors holding a statutory lien; and (iii) creditors holding a fixed pledge or charge over specific assets which were acquired or received by the company using debt advanced by such creditors. The powers of the court under Israeli insolvency laws have been exercised broadly to protect a restructuring entity from actions taken by creditors and other parties and to approve various payments to be made by the restructuring entity and various arrangements with specific creditors or classes of creditors. Accordingly, following commencement of or during such proceeding, we cannot predict if payments under the Notes would be made, whether or when the holders of Notes, the Trustee or the Security Agent could exercise their respective rights under the Indenture and the documents governing the Senior Secured Collateral or whether and to what extent holders of Notes would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and cost, including the fees and disbursements of the Trustee. Furthermore, based on an amendment to the Israeli Companies Law which became effective in January 2013, the following additional factors may adversely affect rights of secured creditors: ----- - without approval of creditors, a company will be permitted to use an asset which is subject to a charge, including selling the asset free of liens (in the ordinary course of business with either the agreement of the creditor or court approval, and not in the ordinary course of business if approved by the court) if necessary for the reorganization of the company. The secured creditor must have “adequate protection”, either from the proceeds of the sale or an asset acquired to replace the asset subject to the disposition. If the asset which is subject to a security interest is sold, the proceeds of sale or any replacement asset which can be identified or traced will be subject to a corresponding security interest in favor of the secured creditor. - without approval of creditors, the company will be able to raise new financing for the continued operations of the company subject to a stay order issued by a court. This new financing is treated as an expense of the reorganization, and is therefore given priority over other liabilities of the company. In such a financing, the company may create a charge in favor of the lenders that would have priority to the existing security interests if the court believes it necessary for the company to raise the funds. The court would need to be satisfied that there is “adequate protection” for the existing secured creditors notwithstanding the creation of the new security interest. See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security _Interests—Israel”._ Similarly, in the event that rehabilitation or restructuring is not sought or does not succeed, the rights of the holders of the Notes and the Trustee to enforce remedies are likely to be sufficiently impaired by bankruptcy, receivership or other liquidation proceedings under applicable Israeli laws such as the Bankruptcy Ordinance (New Version)— 1980 and the Companies Ordinance (New Version)—1983, if the benefit of such laws is sought.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

As a result, it may not be possible for a noteholder to enforce judgments against Altice Dominicana outside the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic is not party to any treaties providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered in judicial proceedings with respect to civil and commercial matters. For a foreign judgment to be effective and enforceable in the Dominican Republic, a request for exequatur (a judgment issued by a Dominican court validating a foreign judicial decision) must be presented before the Court of First Instance (Juzgado de Primera Instancia) of the Dominican Republic. The Court of First Instance will examine the foreign judicial decision to determine whether to ratify or deny its execution under Dominican law. If exequatur is granted, the judgment issued by the foreign court will be enforceable in the Dominican Republic. In a judicial process seeking _exequatur to enforce a foreign judgment the Dominican courts’ examination of the matter should be limited to procedural issues such as jurisdiction, due service of process, the opportunity of the parties to present their respective cases, adherence to public policy rules, enforcement matters and the requirements necessary for authenticity in the Dominican Republic, such as official translations into Spanish. In practice, however, Dominican courts have substantial discretion and may revisit the merits of the case, if deemed necessary. Procedures for obtaining an exequatur could be lengthy. With respect to the recognition and enforcement of decisions rendered in arbitration proceedings, the Dominican Republic is party to the 1958 New York Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the “New York Convention”) since 2002, without reservation. Dominican Law No. 489 08 on Commercial Arbitration (Ley No. 498 08 sobre Arbitraje Comercial) sets forth the process to obtain an exequatur for a foreign arbitral award as an ex parte process in which the petitioner is required to file a motion requesting the exequatur (along with an original, duly legalized and certified counterpart of the award and the arbitration clause or agreement to arbitrate). The Civil and Commercial Court of First Instance of the National District (Cámara Civil _y Comercial del Juzgado de Primera Instancia del Distrito Nacional) has exclusive jurisdiction to grant exequatur_ for foreign arbitral awards. The grounds for a judge to deny an exequatur are the same as the ones provided for in the New York Convention. The decision granting an exequatur to a foreign arbitral award can be challenged through an annulment claim on the grounds specifically provided in the law (which are the same grounds as those established in the New York Convention). There are precedents of exequaturs granted to foreign arbitral awards based on the New York Convention as well as under the Law No. 489 08 on Commercial Arbitration. There are also precedents from the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Justice (Suprema Corte de Justicia) of the Dominican Republic on matters relating to annulment claims filed against decisions granting exequatur to foreign arbitral awards. Although Dominican courts typically validate foreign judicial decisions and arbitral awards that do not conflict with the public policy of the Dominican Republic, there is no assurance that the Civil and ----- Commercial Chamber of the Court of First Instance of the National District will render a decision ratifying any such foreign judgment or arbitral award. On the other hand, as a matter of public policy, the property of the Dominican State cannot be subject to seizure or foreclosure for repayment of obligations incurred during the course of operating or using such property. This policy cannot be waived by the Dominican government. Therefore, even if an arbitral award or legal decision were rendered against the Dominican government and validated in that country, such judgment may not be enforced against the property of the Dominican State. However, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Dominican Republic has stated that, under certain circumstances, the principle of non-seizure of the State’s property (or immunity from seizure) may not be applicable, particularly if the “public entity” to which property has been seized and/or enforcement is being sought, is a concessionaire of the Dominican government, as opposed to the Dominican government itself, and has been incorporated as a commercial entity to perform commercial and industrial activities on its own. The Dominican State is the owner of the radioelectric spectrum. Under the rule of non-seizure of State property such frequencies (or the right to use the same) may not be seized by a creditor. However, General Telecommunications Law No. 153 98 provides that concession and license rights may be pledged as security on the condition that a prior authorization from Indotel is obtained, which shall not be denied without justified cause.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

As a result, it may not be possible for a holder of the Notes to enforce judgements against Portuguese companies or their directors outside of Portugal. However, a judgment given in an EU country will, in principle, be enforceable in Portugal without re-examination of the merits, subject to the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, and shall be directly enforceable in Portugal without the need to request a declaration of enforceability (“exequator”), as per article 39 of the Regulation. Notwithstanding this, judgments of EU countries will not be recognized in Portugal, among other circumstances, if: (i) such recognition is manifestly contrary to Portuguese public policy; (ii) the defendant was not served with the document that instituted the proceedings in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable the defendant to arrange for his/her defense; (iii) it is irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in Portugal; (iv) it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment given in another EU or non-EU country involving the same cause of action and the same parties, provided that the earlier judgment fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in Portugal. Nevertheless, Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters is not applicable to the following matters: (i) the status or legal capacity of natural persons, matrimonial matters, wills and succession; (ii) bankruptcy; (iii) social security; and (iv) arbitration. Foreign judgments duly obtained outside the EU will be enforceable in Portugal after being reviewed and authorized (exequátur) by a Portuguese court in accordance with article 978 of the Portuguese Civil Procedure Code. According to article 979 of the said Code, the Portuguese court competent to review and authorise (exequátur) the judgment is the Tribunal da Relação (court of appeal) of the judicial district where the person against whom the judgment will be enforced is domiciled. Pursuant to articles 703, 980 and others of the Portuguese Civil Procedure Code, in order for the judgment to be authorized: (i) there must be no doubts regarding the authenticity of the document containing the judgment or about the intelligibility of the judgment; (ii) the matter at issue must be res judicata according to the laws of the country that rendered the judgment; (iii) the competence of the court was not claimed fraudulently and that the case submitted did not fall under the exclusive competence of the Portuguese courts; (iv) the exceptions of lis pendens and res judicata cannot be alleged on the grounds that there is a case pending before a Portuguese court unless the foreign court prevented jurisdiction; (v) the defendant must have been duly notified of the legal action in accordance with the laws of the country where the judgment was rendered, and in the proceedings the principles that the parties have a right to equal treatment and to contest claims were complied with; and (vi) the outcome of the judgment rendered cannot be manifestly incompatible with the international public policy of Portugal. ----- With respect to the recognition and enforcement of decisions rendered in arbitration proceedings, Portugal is party to the New York Convention without reservation. Moreover, Portuguese Law No. 63/2011 of December 14, 2011 on Arbitration sets forth the process to obtain an exequatur for a foreign arbitral award, in which the petitioner is required to file a motion requesting the exequatur (along with an original, duly legalized and certified counterpart of the award and the arbitration clause or agreement to arbitrate).

Currently the SEGM has not been established and consequently such system is not yet available for registering Moveable Property Security. In light of such uncertainties, a bill has been introduced in the Dominican Republic Congress which seeks to postpone the entry into force of Law 45-20 until the year 2023, in order to allow local authorities more time to establish the SEGM and address the problems created by the entry into force of Law 45-20 (the “Bill”). As a result, we have entered into amendments to the Dominican Republic Security Documents pursuant to which security interests in the form of Moveable Property Securities have been created under Law 45-20 and alternatively, in case the Bill is enacted, under the previously existing legal regime. Notwithstanding such amendments, if the Bill is not enacted into law ----- and the security interests granted under the Dominican Republic Security Documents are held to be unenforceable due to the enactment of Law 45-20 and/or the unavailability of the SEGM, the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Senior Secured Collateral will be adversely impacted and the secured parties’ rights will be equal to the rights of general unsecured creditors in the event of a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16), have mandatory application for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021, as described in Note 1.3.2 of the 2020 Financial Statements, and had no material impacts on the amounts recognized as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and on the disclosure in the Unaudited Financial Statements. The Group has adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method of adoption with the date of initial application of January 1, 2019. Upon adoption of IFRS 16, the Group applied a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases that it is the lessee. The Group recognized lease liabilities to make lease payments and ROU assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. The standard provides specific transition requirements and practical expedients, which have been applied by the Group. The main effects of the ----- adoption of IFRS 16 on assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2019, were a recognition of ROU assets of €896 million which are recognized and presented separately in the statement of financial position and include the lease assets in the amount of €19 million previously recognized under finance leases and reclassified from the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets line items, and an increase in lease liabilities by €930 million (current and non-current) (including the reclassification of finance lease liabilities already recorded as of December 31, 2018 in the amount of €54 million) of which the current and non-current liabilities increased by €853 million and €77 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, current and non-current lease liabilities increased by €83 million and €840 million, respectively, compared to December 31, 2018 mainly due to the adoption of IFRS 16, which was offset by lease payments for the year ended December 31, 2019. The variance in non-current and current lease liabilities is calculated by taking the difference between the non-current and current lease liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2019 compared to the non-current and current financial leases recorded as of December 31, 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expenses related to lease liabilities amounted to €74 million following the adoption of IFRS 16 compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 1.3.3 to the 2019 Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, for more information. The financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the 2019 Financial Statements has not been restated for the impacts of IFRS 16. See Note 1.3.3 to the 2019 Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, for more information.

Due to the significant nature of certain of these acquisitions and disposals, the comparability of our results of operations based on the Historical Consolidated Financial Information may be affected. See “—Discussion and Analysis of _Our Results of Operations—Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2020—Significant Events Affecting Historical Results”, “—Discussion and Analysis of Our Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2020 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019—Significant Events Affecting Historical Results” and “—Discussion and Analysis of Our Results of Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2019 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018—Significant Events Affecting Historical Results”. In addition, we generally record goodwill relating to acquisitions. As of March 31, 2021, the goodwill_ recorded on our statement of financial position amounted to €3,175 million (compared to €3,139 million as of December 31, 2020 and €3,248 million as of December 31, 2019). Goodwill is subject to impairment reviews in accordance with IFRS and any impairment charge on goodwill would have a negative impact on operating profit. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, we did not identify any changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Therefore, in the first quarter of 2021 no impairment review has been performed and we did not incur any impairment losses. In general, our results of operations in historical periods have been impacted by actions taken and expenditures incurred to improve the operational performance of our businesses. We have aimed to integrate and improve the businesses by focusing on several key areas, including (i) investing in the Group’s fiber network, migrating existing DSL subscribers to the Group’s own network and reducing the need for third party network services, (ii) continuous investments in the Group’s mobile infrastructure, such as 5G, (iii) improving and simplifying operational processes and reducing IT costs by investing in new platforms, (iv) integrating sales organizations, optimizing the Group’s sales channels and simplifying the Group’s brand portfolio, (v) implementing procurement efficiencies by leveraging the Group’s bargaining power and (vi) reducing overhead costs. At the core of the Group’s strategy is customer, revenue, profitability and cash flow growth by efficiently running telecom assets, creating underlying organic growth, and as a result, achieving a leverage profile consistent with the stated target leverage range. The Group benefits from a unique asset base which is fully convergent, fiber rich, active across residential consumers and businesses and holds number one or number two positions in each of its markets with nationwide coverage. The reinforced operational focus offers significant value creation potential. Key elements of the Group’s growth strategy include: - Building operational and financial turnaround in Portugal; - Optimizing the performance in each market with a particular focus on customer services; - Continuing to invest in best-in-class infrastructure commensurate with our market position; - Growing advertising revenue; and - The potential monetization of part of the Group companies’ infrastructure and assets at attractive valuations. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred other expenses and income of €(59) million and €367 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this comprised primarily of a net gain on sale of interest in associates of €101 million from the sale of PT Portugal’s 25% equity stake in Belmont which was partially offset by restructuring costs relating to termination payments in connection with the voluntary employee reduction program in PT Portugal, and for the year ended December 31, 2019, this comprised primarily of ----- restructuring costs relating to the voluntary employee reduction program undertaken in Portugal in 2019 for which a €293 million expense, which will be tax deductible upon payment, was recorded. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred other expenses and income of €245 million and €(90) million, respectively. For three months ended March 31, 2021, this comprised primarily of €241 million costs relating to the preretirement program in Portugal launched in March 2021 and for three months ended March 31, 2020, this comprised primarily of net gain on sale of interest in associates of €98 million from the sale of PT Portugal’s 25% equity stake in Belmont. Other expenses and income primarily include costs with respect to renegotiations or termination of contractual arrangements, employee redundancies, fees paid to external counsel, capital gain or loss on investing activities and other administrative expenses related to reorganization of existing or newly acquired businesses.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

We believe that the enhanced value proposition associated with our bundled services enables us to meet our customers’ communication and entertainment requirements while concurrently both increasing customer loyalty and attracting new customers.

The introduction of new products and services have impacted our result of operations in the periods presented by, among other things, opening new revenue streams and/or increasing the profitability of existing revenue streams (e.g. 4P and our fiber roll-out plan in Portugal through FastFiber, which involved extending our fiber proprietary network to in excess of 600,000 additional homes per year for 2020, and advertising services provided by Teads) and, in certain cases, increasing operating expenses and Total Capital Expenditures (e.g., the fiber-roll out in Portugal and UMTS and LTE network build-out costs and roaming costs in Israel relating to our 3G, 4G and 5G mobile services). In addition, through Altice Labs, S.A. (“Altice Labs”) we continue to invest in and make available technologically-advanced customer equipment in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we have launched new offers with new sports and other content in order to differentiate our product offering and to underline our investment in sports rights and other nonlinear content. We regularly review and invest in the content that we offer to provide our subscribers with a flexible and diverse range of programming options, including high-quality local content and exclusive premium content. In addition, the Group is focused on supplementing its own content offerings with premium content produced by or purchased from third parties. At the end of 2015 and at the beginning of 2016, PT Portugal entered into contracts with several first and second division football clubs in Portugal, including F.C. Porto, Vitoria F.C., Rio Ave F.C. and Boavista F.C., to acquire the exclusive broadcasting rights for the home games of these clubs for up to ten football seasons and in February 2017 we acquired a 25% stake in the capital of the Portuguese sports broadcaster SPORT TV. In June 2017, we announced a multi-year partnership with Netflix which allows customers to watch Netflix’s content with eligible devices in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic. We intend to continue to selectively invest in local and value-added premium content as well as sports broadcasting and distribution rights in the future to enrich our differentiated and convergent communication services from those of our competitors.

The cost of a multi-play subscription package generally depends on market conditions, our competitors’ pricing of similar offerings and the content and add-ons available on each platform. In general, the greater the optionality, content and usage time included in the offering, the higher the price of the multi-play package. Our ability to increase or maintain the prices for our fixed-based and mobile services is also limited by regulatory factors in each of the regions in which we operate. In Portugal, for example, the imposition by ANACOM of price controls on interconnection charges as well as the continuous reduction of mobile termination rates have caused interconnection revenues for fixed-line and mobile telephony to steadily decline, although this has been partially offset by the lower interconnection costs we incur. The prices of B2B ----- contracts are negotiated individually with each customer. The B2B market for voice services is extremely pricesensitive and entails very low margins as voice services are highly commoditized, involving sophisticated customers and relatively short-term contracts. The B2B market for data services is less price-sensitive, as data services require more customization and involve service level agreements. In both markets, price competition is strongest in the large corporate and public-sector segments, whereas customer-adapted solutions are an important competitive focus in the medium and small business segments.

We continuously work towards optimizing our cost base by streamlining processes and service offerings, improving productivity by centralizing our business functions, reorganizing our procurement process, eliminating duplicative management functions and overhead, terminating lower-return projects and non-essential consulting and third-party service agreements, and investing in our employee relations and our culture. We continuously implement common technological platforms across our networks to gain economies of scale, notably with respect to billing systems, network improvements and customer premises equipment and are investing in sales, marketing and innovation, including brand-building, enhancing our sales channels and automating provisioning and installation processes. We have also achieved, and expect to continue to achieve, substantial reductions in our operating expenses as we implement uniform bestpractice operational processes across our organization. We have simplified the services we offer, insourced our historical suppliers around technical services to better control quality and reduced costs through the negotiation of attractive interconnection rates and television content pricing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

In recent years, we have increased our fiber deployment and upgraded a significant part of our cable networks. Our fixed-line services in Portugal are primarily delivered over FTTH, DSL and DTH, in Israel are primarily delivered over HFC cables (and since April 2021, fiber-based internet services are also delivered over IBC Israel’s fiber optic network in certain areas where the network had already been deployed) and in the Dominican Republic are delivered over both HFC cable and FTTH, in each case that are among the most technically advanced in the markets in which we operate. Our cable networks enable us to offer download speeds of at least 200 Mbps to a majority of homes passed in our footprint in Israel and the Dominican Republic. In Portugal and the Dominican Republic, we continue to upsell our fiber/cable based services to our existing DSL subscriber base. In Portugal, we own 50.01% of FastFiber which in turn owns the largest fiber network by penetration that passed 5,699,000 homes as of March 31, 2021. We also implemented our fiber rollout strategy in Portugal and through FastFiber we rolled out 388,000 new fiber homes passed in 2018, 356,000 new fiber homes passed in 2019, 603,000 new fiber homes passed in 2020 and a further 73,000 fiber homes passed in the three months ended March 31, 2021. In the periods under review, the Group has also built-out its 4G network to have advanced mobile networks in place in each of its geographies (4G population coverage as of March 31, 2021 of 99.6% in Portugal, 99.9% in Israel and 97.5% in the Dominican Republic). We have also invested in our 5G network in Israel, and offer 5G services in certain areas since first quarter of 2021. We have undertaken certain strategic transactions in recent years to monetize the value of certain non-core assets, including the Towers Transactions. In Israel, the Partner Network Sharing Agreement enables HOT Mobile and Partner Communications Company Ltd. (“Partner”) to share antennas and frequencies and facilitate optimum utilization of the spectrum thereby resulting in savings related to network and maintenance expenses and optimizing Total Capital Expenditures incurred in relation to the mandatory build-out of our mobile network. We continue to evaluate the need to upgrade our cable networks for the deployment of additional fiber, and our mobile networks for advancements in LTE technology and in Israel, to support the introduction of 5G services, on an ongoing basis. During the periods under review, we have incurred significant Capital Expenditures (Accrued) (20.7%, 19.6%, 19.4% and 20.8% of total consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and the ----- three months ended March 31, 2021, respectively) in order to improve our mobile network and to roll out new fiber/cable homes. Our Capital Expenditures (Accrued) amounted to €211 million and €205 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and €840 million, €802 million and €811 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Certain markets, such as Portugal, are mature markets, with a limited number of new customers entering the market. Moreover, the Group’s products and services are subject to increasing competition from alternative new technologies or improvements in existing technologies. With respect to its residential activities, the Group faces competition from telephone companies and other providers of DSL, VDSL2 and fiber network connections. With respect to pay TV services, the Group is faced with growing competition from alternative methods for broadcasting television services other than through traditional cable networks. For example, online content aggregators which broadcast OTT programs on a broadband network, such as internet competitors Amazon, Apple, Google, Disney+ and Netflix, are expected to grow stronger in the future. Connected or ‘smart’ TVs facilitate the use of these services. With respect to the fixed-line and mobile telephony markets, the Group has experienced a shift from fixed-line telephony to mobile telephony and faces intensive competition from established telephone companies, mobile virtual network operators (“MVNOs”) and providers of new technologies such as VoIP. In the competitive B2B data services market, price pressure has been strong. Conversely, the use of data transmission services has significantly increased. The Group is currently facing competition from software providers and other IT providers of data and network solutions, and the line between them and the suppliers of data infrastructure and solutions, like the Group, has become increasingly blurred. Partnerships between IT providers and infrastructure providers are becoming more and more common and are an additional source of competition but also an opportunity for growth. Being able to face the competition efficiently depends in part on the density of the network, and certain of the Group’s competitors in the markets in which we operate have a broader and denser network. In recent years, the B2B market has experienced a structural change marked by a move from traditional switched voice services to VoIP services.

For example, high levels of sovereign debt in certain European countries and countries in the Middle East, combined with weak growth and high unemployment, could lead to low consumer demand, fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), sovereign debt restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and, potentially, disruptions in the credit and equity markets, as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our financial condition. For example, our results of operations in the periods under review have been affected by adverse economic conditions and austerity measures in Portugal which had a negative effect on consumer confidence. Moreover, in Israel, we are subject to the inherent risks associated with political and military conditions and the potential for armed conflicts with Israel’s neighbors. The current macroeconomic environment is volatile, and continuing instability in global markets, including instability related to international trade, tariffs, sovereign debt issues, Brexit, the risk of inflation and deflation and the stability of the euro, natural disasters and pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), has contributed to a challenging global economic environment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Our inability to make additional investments and acquisitions could also affect our ability to compete with other operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

As a result, our reported results of operations can be significantly different compared to the results of our businesses, particularly in Israel and the Dominican Republic on a local currency basis. In Israel, which accounted for 24.1% of the total revenue of the Group after eliminations in the year ended December 31, 2020, a substantial portion of our revenue is in NIS while a portion of our operational expenses and Total Capital Expenditures are incurred in other currencies, including the U.S. dollar. In the year ended December 31, 2020, 16% of our total operating expenses and 20% of our Total Capital Expenditures in Israel were incurred in currencies other than NIS. In the Dominican Republic, which accounted for 12.0% of the total revenue of the Group after eliminations in the year ended December 31, 2020, a substantial portion of our revenue is in DOP while a portion of our operational expenses and Total Capital Expenditures are incurred in other currencies, including the U.S. dollar. In the year ended December 31, 2020, 15% of our total operating expenses and 54% of our Total Capital Expenditures in the Dominican Republic were incurred in currencies other than the DOP. The exchange rate between U.S. dollars and NIS, the euro and NIS and U.S. dollars and DOP, which affect our operations, and the euro and NIS and euro and DOP, which affect the translation risk relating to the consolidation of our financial statements, has been volatile in the past and may continue to be so in the future. Although we attempt to mitigate currency risk to an extent through hedging, sharp changes in the exchange rate could have a material effect on our results of operations. Our borrowings are denominated primarily in euro, U.S. dollars and NIS but do not necessarily match the cash flows generated from operations in such currencies. In addition, a portion of our borrowings bear a floating rate of interest. While we hedge the risk of certain currency and interest rate fluctuations in respect of a portion of our existing debt, these arrangements may not insulate us completely from such exposure. Please see Note 8.3 of the Unaudited Financial Statements for more information. Moreover, the government of the Dominican Republic has imposed exchange controls and currency restrictions in the past and may do so in the future. This is beyond our control and may result in the DOP ceasing to be freely convertible or transferable abroad to service our outstanding indebtedness, or the DOP being significantly depreciated relative to other currencies, including the U.S. dollar, which may impede our ability to service our outstanding obligations and affect our earnings and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Adjusted EBITDA is unaudited and is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards. We believe that this measure is useful to readers of the Historical Consolidated Financial Information as it provides them with a measure of the operating results which excludes certain items we consider outside of our recurring operating activities or that are non-cash, making trends more easily observable and providing information regarding our operating results that allows investors to better identify trends in our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute measure for net income or loss, operating profit, cash flow or other combined income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating profit as the effects of depreciation, amortization and impairment excluded from this measure do ultimately affect the operating results, which is also presented within the annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 1 (Presentation of Financial Statements).

Post-closing, HOT became an equal partner in the IBC Partnership (that holds 70% of IBC Israel’s share capital), together with Cellcom and Israel Infrastructure Fund (“IIF”), and HOT indirectly holds 23.3% of IBC Israel’s share capital, through an investment of €45 million, substantially equal to the investment made by each of Cellcom and IIF. There is an agreement between IBC Israel and HOT, under which HOT undertakes to purchase an indefeasible right, or IRU, to use IBC Israel’s fiber-optic network. There is also a service agreement between IBC Israel and HOT, under which IBC Israel undertakes to purchase certain services from HOT. The transaction was closed on February 11, 2021 following the regulatory and third-party approvals. Following the closing of the transaction, HOT exercises a significant influence over IBC Israel, that is accounted for under the equity method based on the provisions of IAS 28 (Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures). _Portugal pre-retirement program_ In connection with an ongoing transformation process of the Group in Portugal, in a severe context resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the Group companies in Portugal have launched a voluntary employee reduction program in March 2021. This program is aimed at employees aged 50 years or more that decide to enroll in the program, subject to the relevant company’s acceptance, who will have their employment agreements terminated and will be entitled to receive a monthly fixed compensation up to retirement age corresponding to a percentage of their previous remuneration. The deadline for employees to enroll in the program has finished in the second quarter of 2021, but the selection process of the employees that will be allowed to terminate their employment agreements under this pre-retirement scheme is still ongoing. As of March 31, 2021, management considered that the conditions for recording a liability were met under IAS 19 Employee benefits and thus a liability was recognized in the caption “provisions” in the statement of financial position and in the caption “other (expense) and income” of the income statement for an amount of €241 million, relating to approximately 750 employees and corresponding primarily to the present value of salaries payable up to retirement age to the ----- employees that agreed to terminate their employment agreements under pre-retirement schemes. Based on information up to date, the Group expects to record an additional liability in the second quarter of 2021 relating to approximately 200 employees. _For the three months ended March 31, 2020: Sale of 25% equity stake in OMTEL_ On January 2, 2020, the Group announced the sale of a 25% equity interest held by PT Portugal in Belmont Infra Holding S.A. (“Belmont”), that owns 100% of the tower company OMTEL, to Cellnex. Total cash proceeds amounted to €201 million. The net gain on sale of interest in associates recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2020 amounted to €98 million. The sale by PT Portugal of its 25% equity interest in Belmont was part of a larger transaction pursuant to which Cellnex acquired 100% of the share capital of OMTEL. In September 2018, at the time of sale of OMTEL to a consortium including Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and Horizon Equity Partners, PT Portugal had reinvested €109 million for a 25% equity interest in OMTEL. _Redemption of notes_ The Group undertook the following redemptions of notes since January 1, 2020: - On January 13, 2020, Altice Finco redeemed in full the then outstanding Altice Finco 2023 Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of €250 million, in accordance with the indenture governing the Altice Finco 2023 Notes; - On February 10, 2020, Altice Finco redeemed in full the then outstanding Altice Finco 2024 Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $400 million, in accordance with the indenture governing the Altice Finco 2024 Notes; and - On February 18, 2020, Altice Financing redeemed in full the then outstanding Altice Financing 2023 Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of €2,400 million equivalent, in accordance with the indenture governing the Altice Financing 2023 Notes. _Issuance of the Altice Financing 2028 Notes and Altice Financing 2025 Notes_ On January 22, 2020, Altice Financing issued (i) $1,200 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% Senior Secured Notes due January 15, 2028, (ii) €1,100 million aggregate principal amount of 3.000% Senior Secured Notes due January 15, 2028 (together, the “Altice Financing 2028 Notes”) and (iii) €600 million aggregate principal amount of 2.250% Senior Secured Notes due January 15, 2025 (the “Altice Financing 2025 Notes”). _Amendment of 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility_ On February 20, 2020, all of the lenders under the 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility Agreement agreed to amend the 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to extend the maturity date to February 20, 2025, reduce the margin and make certain other changes. _Bridge Facility_ On March 3, 2020, Altice Finco entered into a term loan credit agreement providing for, among other things, a euro denominated term loan in an aggregate principal amount of €500 million (the “2020 Altice Finco Bridge",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Following this amendment, the parties have joint control over PHI (compared to significant influence before the amendment); accordingly, PHI is accounted under the provisions of IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements) as a joint operation (recognition of HOT Mobile’s interests in PHI’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses) instead of the equity method. ----- _Sale of SIRESP by PT Portugal_ At the end of June 2019, PT Portugal entered into an agreement with the Portuguese State to transfer the ownership of its shares in SIRESP’s share capital in December 2019. The transfer of ownership was completed on December 1, 2019. The net gain on sale of interest in associates recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to €1 million.

This increase in revenue was mainly the consequence of positive performances in residential equipment, business services and media, which was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from residential fixed and residential mobile. Revenue was also negatively impacted by the unfavorable development of the foreign currency rate for NIS and DOP. NIS average exchange rate decreased by 2.2% compared to the euro and DOP average exchange rate decreased by 18.2% compared to the euro.

Revenue from Portugal’s fixed residential service increased by 6.0% from €155 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €164 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in revenues is explained by market share gains over the recent quarters and the higher contributions from high-value convergent package fees, including migrations from customers being served by our DSL network to fiber. Portugal’s mobile residential service business reported a net revenue decrease of 2.1% from €118 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, to €115 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. This decline is the consequence of lower pre-paid revenues, primarily driven by migrations to both post-paid and convergent packages and lower roaming-out revenues, further impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which was partially offset by the increase in post-paid revenues. Portugal reported a residential equipment revenue increase of 12.0% from €23 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, to €26 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. This increase was largely driven by the increasing commercial momentum after the opening of MEO shops from the end of the first quarter of 2021. ----- Revenue from Portugal’s business services increased by 7.6% from €226 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €243 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. This increase is primarily explained by higher equipment sales from Altice Labs, equipment sales of laptops to schools and handsets to corporates. _Israel: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Israel generated revenue of €247 million, a 0.3% increase_ compared to €247 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2021 was higher compared to the corresponding period in 2020 with two weeks of lockdown in the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to almost two months of lockdown in the three months ended March 31, 2021. The lower reported growth rate in comparison to the local currency growth rate is partially driven by the unfavorable development of the foreign currency rate for NIS during the first quarter of 2021 in comparison to the first quarter of 2020. On a local currency basis, revenue increased by 2.5%. Fixed residential service revenue decreased by 4.6%, which was mainly driven by fierce competition in both fixed and mobile market. Mobile residential service revenue decreased by 2.8% on a local currency basis due a stabilization in the mobile subscriber base and an increasing price competition. Israel’s residential equipment revenue increased by 36.9% largely due to the increase in digital sales channels as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic which was offset by the store closures. Business services revenue increased by 28.2%, mainly due to the increase in B2B equipment sales. _Dominican Republic: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Dominican Republic generated total_ revenue of €118 million, an 11.1% decrease compared to €133 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. On a local currency basis, revenue increased by 5.1%. Therefore, the decrease in reported revenue was mainly driven by the unfavorable development of the foreign currency rate for DOP. On a local currency basis, fixed residential service revenue increased by 5.6% due to a growth in the subscriber base, stabilizing ARPU and decrease in churn. Mobile residential service revenue grew by 2.6% due to an increase in prepaid and postpaid subscriber base as a result of positive net additions. The Dominican Republic’s residential equipment revenue increased by 15.5%, largely due to the reopening of shops and stands in the first three months of 2021. Business services revenue grew by 8.0%, largely due to an increase in revenues from fixed television as a result of the revenue generated pursuant to the contract for transmission of educational content with the Ministry of Education, as well as internet driven by customers increased demand for higher capacity plans. _Teads: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Teads generated revenue of €102 million, compared to €90_ million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in media revenue was mainly driven by a strong first quarter for Teads in 2021, where several geographies contributed positively to the growth.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,295,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE GROUP,295.35,Adjusted EBITDA,295.35.1,,"For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €371 million, a decrease of 1.1% compared to €375 million for the three months ended 31, 2020. This decrease can be attributed to a higher percentage increase in purchasing and subcontracting costs and staff costs and employee benefit expenses compared to total revenue. _Operating segments Portugal: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Adjusted EBITDA in Portugal was €204 million, a_ decrease of 2.8% from €210 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease can be attributed to a higher percentage increase in purchasing and subcontracting costs and staff costs and employee benefit expenses, compared to total revenue. The increase in purchasing and contracting costs is mainly related to higher cost of goods sold and higher raw materials consumption as a consequence the increase in residential equipment and B2B equipment sales from Altice Labs. The increase in staff costs reflects primarily the effect of the consolidation of Intelcia in the financial statements since March 2020. The decrease in other operating expenses is primarily explained by lower sales and marketing costs, reflecting lower commercial activity due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower call center expenses reflecting the internalization of some of these operations in Intelcia, partially offset by higher provisions for bad debt and higher general and administration expenses compared to pre-pandemic levels. _Israel: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Adjusted EBITDA in Israel was €80 million, a decrease_ of 12.7% compared to €91 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Adjusted EBITDA on a local currency basis decreased by 10.7% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in Adjusted ----- EBITDA is largely attributable to an increase in cost of goods sold as a consequence of the increase in mobile equipment related sales. _Dominican Republic: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Adjusted EBITDA in the Dominican_ Republic decreased by 10.6% from €67 million for three months ended March 31, 2020 to €60 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 (an increase of 5.6% on a local currency basis). On a local currency basis, the increase in Adjusted EBITDA is largely attributable to the reactivation of commercial activity and residential customer base increase. _Teads: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Adjusted EBITDA for Teads amounted to €29 million,_ compared to €9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, an increase of 240.7%. The increase is explained by an increase in revenues and a reduction in operating expenses due to the renegotiation of contracts with advertisers, lower marketing costs and lower travel and entertainment expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA was €1,580 million, an increase of 2.0% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 (€1,548 million). This increase can be attributed mainly to lower other operating expenses which offset the impact of lower revenue. _Operating segments Portugal: For the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA in Portugal was €834 million, an increase_ of 0.2% from €832 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA is largely attributable to higher revenues and lower operating expenses but which were largely offset by higher purchasing and contracting costs and staff costs and employee benefit expenses. The increase in purchasing and contracting, mainly related to costs of goods sold, are in line with the decrease in revenue. The increase in other operating expenses was driven by lower sales and marketing costs which reflect lower commercial activity during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lower energy costs as a result of the acquisition of a participation in MEO Energia and lower call center expenses reflecting the internalization of certain call center activities, although this resulted in higher staff costs and employee benefit expenses. _Israel: For the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA in Israel was €354 million, a decrease of 1.5%_ compared to €359 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA on a local currency basis decreased by 3.2% compared to 2019, which is mainly due to a decrease in high-margin revenue which was offset by an increase in purchasing and contracting, in line with the higher revenue. _Dominican Republic: For the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA in the Dominican Republic_ decreased by 13.8% from €278 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €240 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (a decrease of 3.0% on a local currency basis). On a local currency basis, the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA is largely attributable to the decrease in high-margin revenue and an increase in bad debt due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was partially offset by lower cost of sales in line with the lower revenue. _Teads: For the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA for Teads amounted to €156 million, compared_ to €83 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 88.8%. The increase is explained by an increase in revenues and a reduction in operating expenses due to the renegotiation of contracts with advertisers, lower marketing costs and lower travel and entertainment expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA was €1,548 million, a decrease of 4.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (€1,616 million). This decrease can be attributed to lower revenues, which were partially offset by lower operating expenses. To an extent these movements were driven by the sale of Altice TV, which is no longer part of the Group following the sale to an affiliate of the Group on May 15, 2018 and the sale of the FOT Business to Altice France on October 31, 2018. _Operating segments Portugal: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA in Portugal was €832 million,_ a decrease of 4.3% from €870 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA is largely attributable to an increase in expenses due to higher programming costs, mainly as a result of the football-related broadcasting rights which were acquired in 2016 but which started to be broadcasted as from the 2018/2019 football season, higher costs of goods sold related to mobile handsets, which are in line with the higher revenues, and an increase in infrastructure rental expenses due to the sale of the tower business and subsequent lease of towers. The negative impact of these drivers on Adjusted EBITDA was only partially offset by (i) lower international voice traffic costs, in line with the decline in associated business services revenues, (ii) lower customer service expenses related to bad debt and billing expenses due to electronic invoice penetration and callcenter activities and (iii) lower staff costs and employee benefits due to the favorable impact related to employees who terminated their employment agreements in March 2019 under the voluntary employee reduction program. ----- _Israel: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA in Israel was €359 million, a_ decrease of 11.4% compared to €406 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA on a local currency basis decreased by 16.7% compared to 2018, mainly due to a decrease in residential fixed revenues in addition to an increase in purchasing and sub-contracting costs, mainly due to an increase in the cost of sale of mobile handsets associated to an increase in mobile revenues, an increase in sport channel content expense, and an increase in staff costs as a result of a new agreement with the labor unions. _Dominican Republic: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA in the Dominican_ Republic decreased by 5.4% from €294 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €278 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a local currency basis, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 7.5% due to the reduction in business services revenues, mainly explained by the sale of the international wholesale voice carrier business, a transaction which closed on September 6, 2018, and lower international voice traffic. In addition, network operating costs increased due to network growth and due to the sale of the tower business and subsequent lease of towers. Staff costs and employee benefits increased due to the increase in the average number of FTEs due to additional sales and retention staff. These decreases in Adjusted EBITDA were partly offset by lower cost of sales related to the international wholesale voice carrier business and lower international voice traffic. _Teads: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for Teads amounted to €83 million,_ compared to €60 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 37.1%. The increase is explained by higher revenues, as described above, but which were partly offset by higher other operating expenses, staff costs and employee benefits. _Altice TV: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for Altice TV is nil, compared_ to Adjusted EBITDA of €(75) million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change is explained by the sale of Altice TV, which is no longer part of the Group following the sale to an affiliate of the Group on May 15, 2018. _Others: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA in Others was €(4) million,_ compared to a Adjusted EBITDA of €60 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Total cash proceeds amounted to €201 million. The net gain on sale of interest in associates recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to €101 million. The sale by PT Portugal of its 25% equity interest in Belmont was part of a larger transaction pursuant to which Cellnex acquired 100% of the share capital of OMTEL. In September 2018, at the time of sale of OMTEL to a consortium, including Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and Horizon Equity Partners, PT Portugal had reinvested €109 million for a 25% equity interest in OMTEL. _Closing of the partnership with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and the sale of 49.99% interest in FastFiber (formerly Altice Portugal FTTH)_ On December 12, 2019, PT Portugal entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners regarding the sale of a 49.99% interest in the Portuguese fiber business to be carved-out into a dedicated wholesale vehicle, FastFiber (formerly Altice Portugal FTTH), comprising of the fiber passive infrastructure assets and rights, related contracts and underlying agreements, thereby creating a nationwide fiber wholesaler in Portugal. On April 17, 2020, the transaction was closed and the Group received a cash consideration of €1,576 million for the sale of 49.99% of the share capital of FastFiber (€773 million) and for the sale of 49.99% of the existing intercompany loan (€800 million), which was simultaneously converted into mandatory convertible notes. The proceeds from the transaction were partly used to further deleverage the Group’s debt. Furthermore, the Group recorded a receivable representing the net present value of an earn-out of €375 million due in December 2021. A second earn-out is due in December 2026 subject to some performance conditions and the Group did not take into consideration the second earn-out in the valuation of the purchase price and thus the capital gain recognized at closing of the transaction. Following the closing of the transaction, PT Portugal continues to control and fully consolidate FastFiber. The transaction resulted in the recognition of a non-controlling interest of €4 million and a gain of €1,112 million in equity in the year ended December 31, 2020. FastFiber sells wholesale services to all ----- operators at the same financial terms. MEO sells technical services to FastFiber for the construction, the subscriber connection and the maintenance of its fiber network. _Redemption of notes_ The Group undertook the following redemptions of notes since January 1, 2020: - On January 13, 2020, Altice Finco redeemed in full the then outstanding Altice Finco 2023 Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of €250 million, in accordance with the indenture governing the Altice Finco 2023 Notes; - On February 10, 2020, Altice Finco redeemed in full the then outstanding Altice Finco 2024 Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $400 million, in accordance with the indenture governing the Altice Finco 2024 Notes; - On February 18, 2020, Altice Financing redeemed in full the then outstanding Altice Financing 2023 Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of €2,400 million equivalent, in accordance with the indenture governing the Altice Financing 2023 Notes; - Between June 4, 2020 and September 25, 2020, Altice Financing repurchased and cancelled the Altice Financing 2026 Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to $279 million; and - On July 22, 2020, Altice Finco redeemed in full the then outstanding Altice Finco 2025 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $385 million (€333 million equivalent). _Issuance of the Altice Financing 2028 Notes and Altice Financing 2025 Notes_ On January 22, 2020, Altice Financing issued the Altice Financing 2028 Notes and the Altice Financing 2025 Notes. _Amendment of 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility_ On February 20, 2020, all of the lenders under the 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility Agreement agreed to amend the 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to extend the maturity date to February 20, 2025, reduce the margin and make certain other changes. _Bridge Facility_ On March 3, 2020, Altice Finco entered into a term loan credit agreement providing for, among other things, a euro denominated term loan in an aggregate principal amount of €500 million (the “2020 Altice Finco Bridge",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

This increase was driven primarily by Portugal and Israel, as the residential fixed service revenue displayed a steady growth, reflecting the sustained contribution of positive net adds. This increase, however, was partially offset by a decrease in the Dominican Republic, which was largely driven by the adverse development of the average exchange rate of DOP. The Group’s revenue from residential mobile business decreased to €952 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a 2.4% decrease compared to €975 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in prepaid revenue in the Dominican Republic, which was partially offset by an increase in postpaid revenues due to a higher subscriber base and negatively impacted by the adverse development of the average exchange rate of DOP. Residential mobile revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was also negatively impacted by a decrease in roaming revenue year over year, as a result of a decrease in international travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ----- The Group’s residential equipment revenue decreased by 7.0% to €211 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to €227 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly driven by the closure of shops in the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Group’s business services revenue decreased to €1,141 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a 1.1% decrease compared to €1,154 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly driven by the Dominican Republic due to a decrease in roaming revenue year over year, as a result of a decrease in international travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the adverse development of the average exchange rate of DOP. Revenue from the Group’s media activities totaled €477 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a 5.2% increase compared to €453 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in media revenue was mainly driven by a strong fourth quarter of Teads, after the second quarter and to a lesser extent the third quarter, were impacted due to the severe slowdown of the global advertising market as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. _Operating segments Portugal: For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group generated revenues in Portugal of €2,118 million, a_ 0.5% increase compared to €2,107 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenues from Portugal’s residential fixed business increased by 1.5%, from €613 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €622 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is explained by the sustained contribution of positive net adds and higher contributions from bundles, including migrations from DSL to fiber, leading to higher revenues from internet and TV. This effect was partially offset by lower revenues from sports premium channels because of their billing suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Portugal’s residential mobile business posted a net revenue decrease of 0.6%, from €469 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to €466 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Postpaid revenue increased in line with a continued increase in the customer base. However, this increase was offset by lower prepaid service revenue, which was largely driven by the stay-at-home restrictions and lower roaming revenue as a result of decreased international travel, both driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenues from Portugal’s residential equipment business decreased by 1.1%, from €109 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €108 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was largely driven by the closing of the MEO shops from the end of March 2020 until the beginning of May 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenues from Portugal’s business services increased by 0.6%, from €919 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €925 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is mainly explained by higher equipment sales, which compensated for a decrease in commercial activity in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. _Israel: For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group generated revenue in Israel of €981 million, a 1.9%_ increase compared to €962 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a local currency basis, revenue increased by 0.2%. On a local currency basis, the fixed residential service revenue increased by 0.1%, which was driven by a growth in the subscriber base, despite strong competition in the fixed market. Residential mobile revenue increased by 4.5% on a local currency basis due to an increase in the mobile subscriber base, supportive ARPU trends and the increased use of telecommunication services due to the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the increasing price competition. Israel’s residential equipment revenue decreased by 9.1% largely due to the closure of shops and booths at shopping malls due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Business revenue decreased by 0.8%, mainly due to loss of B2B roaming revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic and loss of iDEN revenue as the iDEN technology was decommissioned by the end of 2019. The increase in revenue on a reported basis was also partially driven by the favorable development of the foreign currency rate for NIS during the first half of 2020, although NIS depreciated in the second half year of 2020. _Dominican Republic: For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group generated total revenue of €490 million_ in the Dominican Republic, a 12.7% decrease compared to €561 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a local currency basis, revenue decreased by 1.6%. On a local currency basis, fixed residential service revenue increased by 1.6% due to a growth in the subscriber base but which was largely offset by a decrease in reconnection and late payment fees due to government regulations. Residential mobile revenue increased by 0.5%, ----- with a decrease in prepaid consumption largely offset by an increase in the postpaid subscriber revenues resulting from an increased subscriber base. The Dominican Republic’s residential equipment revenue decreased by 9.6%, largely due to the closure of shops due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lower subsidies on equipment sales. Business services decreased by 7.5%, largely in wholesale revenue, mainly due to lower international voice traffic and pricing. The decrease in revenue was also partially driven by the unfavorable development of the foreign currency rate for DOP. _Teads: For the year ended December 31, 2020, Teads generated revenue of €476 million, a 5.3% increase_ compared to €452 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenue was mainly driven by a strong fourth quarter of Teads in 2020, after the second and third quarter were impacted due to the severe slowdown of the global advertising market as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The decrease is mainly explained by lower interest following the refinancing activities in 2019 and in the first quarter of 2020 and reduction of the average financial debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. _Realized and unrealized (losses)/gains on derivative instruments linked to financial debt_ For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group’s realized and unrealized loss on derivative instruments linked to financial debt totaled €230 million compared to a realized and unrealized gain on derivative instruments of €147 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly driven by the variation in the mark to market of the Group’s derivative financial instruments in Altice Financing. ----- _Other financial expenses_ For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group’s other financial expenses totaled €110 million, a 2.7% decrease compared to €113 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. _Finance income_ For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group’s finance income amounted to €338 million, a 61.7% increase compared to €209 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due to the increase in net foreign exchange gains and an increase of interest income on loans and receivables, which increased from €1,598 million as of ended December 31, 2019 to €2,498 million as of December 31, 2020. _Net result on extinguishment and remeasurement of financial liabilities_ For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group’s net gain on extinguishment and remeasurement of financial liabilities amounted to €371 million, compared to a net loss of €10 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The gain on extinguishment of a financial liability for the year ended December 31, 2020 relates to the remeasurement of the net present value of future interest payments for the AI Mandatory Convertible Notes and redemptions of the Group’s notes issued by Altice Financing and Altice Finco.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Altice France acquired a 65% interest in the capital of ACS from Altice International for a total consideration of €30 million. ACS comprises mainly of companies of the Intelcia group, a French language-focused player in the customer relations management outsourcing industry. The capital gain recorded in equity amounted to €3 million, net of tax. Altice France also acquired a 100% interest in ATS France from Altice International for a total consideration of €175 million.

A total amount of €156 million was paid. As a result of the exercise of the call option, the Group’s ownership in ATS prior to the sale to Altice France increased to 100%. _PT Portugal acquisition of the shares of SIRESP_ On October 31, 2018, PT-Móveis-Serviços de Telecomunicações, SGPS, S.A., a subsidiary of PT Portugal, purchased the shares of SIRESP and thus became the majority stakeholder with 52.1% ownership.

This decrease was driven primarily by growing competition and the associated pricing pressure in Israel and the sale of the FOT Business to Altice France on October 31, 2018. The Group’s residential mobile business revenue decreased to €1,191 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a 4.2% decrease compared to €1,244 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven by the sale of the FOT Business to Altice France on October 31, 2018 but partially offset by an increase in mobile residential revenues in Israel due to higher equipment sales and an increase in the mobile subscriber base and a favorable foreign exchange impact, and in Portugal by an increase in post-paid customer base, although this was partly offset by a loss of prepaid customers. The Group’s business services revenue decreased to €1,154 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a 6.6% decrease compared to €1,235 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven by the sale of the FOT Business to Altice France on October 31, 2018, in addition to decreases in Portugal and the Dominican Republic due to the sale of the international wholesale voice carrier business, a transaction which closed on September 6, 2018, and lower international voice traffic. Revenues from the Group’s media activities totaled €453 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a 22.2% increase compared to €371 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was mainly due to increases in Teads resulting from higher sales, which was partially offset by a reduction in revenues due to the sale of Altice TV, which is no longer part of the Group following the sale to an affiliate of the Group on May 15, 2018. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by a favorable development of the foreign currency rates for the Israeli Shekel and the Dominican Peso, which, based on the average exchange rate, increased by 5.9% and 1.7% respectively. _Operating segments Portugal: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group generated revenues in Portugal of €2,107 million, a_ marginal decrease compared to €2,108 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenues from the Group’s residential fixed business increased by 0.5% from €618 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €622 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is explained by the positive net adds reported during 2019, as compared to negative net adds during 2018, which was largely offset by a decline in fixed ARPU due to competitive pressure. The Group’s residential mobile business posted a net revenue increase of 1.3% from €562 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to €569 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by an increase in postpaid customer base, which was partially offset by a higher loss of prepaid subscribers in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. ----- Revenues from the Group’s business services decreased by 1.1% from €929 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €919 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly explained by the sale of the international wholesale voice carrier business, a transaction which closed on September 6, 2018, and lower international voice traffic. _Israel: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group generated revenue in Israel of €962 million, a 2.2%_ increase compared to €941 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is partially explained by the favorable development of the foreign currency rate for the Israeli Shekel, which, based on the average exchange rate, increased by 5.9%. On a local currency basis, revenues decreased by 3.9%, mainly due to a decrease in fixed residential revenues as a result of a strong competition in the fixed market, despite an increase in cable customer base in 2019. The decrease in the fixed market was partly offset by an increase in residential mobile revenues due to higher equipment sales and an increase in the mobile subscriber base while the market is still under price pressure. Business services continued to demonstrate high performance and steady growth in revenues, showing an increase of 3.4% in 2019 compared to 2018 and an increase of 12.7% excluding iDEN revenues, which commenced decommissioning by the end of 2018. _Dominican Republic: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group generated total revenue of €561 million,_ a 4.9% decrease compared to €589 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was partially mitigated by the favorable development of the foreign currency rate for the Dominican Peso, which, based on the average exchange rate, increased by 1.7%. On a local currency basis, revenues decreased by 0.5%, which was largely driven by a decrease in mobile residential revenues as a result of voice erosion, and a decrease in wholesale revenues, mainly due to the sale of the international wholesale voice carrier business, a transaction which closed on September 6, 2018, and lower international voice traffic. _Teads: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group generated revenue in Teads of €452 million, compared_ to €341 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in revenues is explained by the commercial success of newly introduced services and product formats, as well as the continued growth in the United States and Asia-Pacific regions. _Altice TV: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group generated total revenue in Altice TV of nil, compared_ to €25 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is explained by the sale of Altice TV, which is no longer part of the Group following the sale to an affiliate of the Group on May 15, 2018. _Others: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group generated total revenue in Others (which comprises of_ the Group’s corporate entities) of €2 million, compared to €180 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is mainly explained by the sale of the FOT Business to Altice France on October 31, 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Group has an aggregate of €393.2 million (equivalent) available borrowings under the 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility and the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, of which €110 has been drawn. We expect to use these sources of liquidity to fund operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other liquidity requirements that may arise from time to time. Further, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Group had access to the Altice Financing Guarantee Facilities allowing for requests for guarantees to be issued up to a maximum of €139.5 million. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Altice Financing has made requests for guarantees of up to €131.5 million in aggregate principal amount to be issued under the Altice Financing Guarantee Facilities, which represents a contingent liability of the Group. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Altice Financing Guarantee _Facilities”. The availability of borrowings under the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities and the Altice_ Financing Guarantee Facilities is conditioned upon compliance with specified leverage ratios. Our ability to generate cash from our operations will depend on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, the cash provided from the operations of our operating subsidiaries and any available borrowings under the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements during the next 12 months, although no assurance can be given that this will be the case. However, as our debt matures in later years, we anticipate that we will seek to refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to complete such refinancing transactions or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it is not possible to anticipate how economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns and/or any adverse regulatory developments could impact the credit markets we access and accordingly, our future liquidity and financial position. In addition, sustained or increased competition, particularly in combination with adverse economic or regulatory developments, could have an unfavorable impact on our cash flows and liquidity. The debt issued by the Group is subject to certain restrictive covenants. Other than the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities and the Altice Financing Guarantee Facilities, described below, such debt issued by the Group is subject to incurrence based covenants, which do not require ongoing compliance with financial ratios, but place certain limitations on the relevant restricted group’s ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional debt (including to finance new acquisitions), create liens, pay dividends and other distributions to shareholders or prepay subordinated indebtedness, make investments, sell assets, engage in affiliate transactions or engage in mergers or consolidations. These covenants are subject to several important exceptions and qualifications. To be able to incur additional debt under an applicable debt instrument, the relevant restricted group must either meet the ratio test described below (on a pro forma basis for any contemplated transaction giving rise to the debt incurrence) or have available capacity under a general debt basket or meet certain other exceptions to the limitation on indebtedness covenant in such debt instrument. Senior secured debt and senior debt of the Group is subject to the following incurrence tests: Senior secured debt of the Group is subject to an incurrence test of 3:1 (L2QA Adjusted EBITDA to net secured debt) and senior debt is subject to an incurrence test of 4:1 (L2QA Adjusted EBITDA to net debt), as each term is defined in the Altice Financing Indentures and Altice Finco Indentures, respectively. Altice International and its relevant subsidiaries are allowed to fully consolidate the EBITDA from any subsidiaries in which they have a controlling interest and that are contained in the restricted group as defined in the relevant debt instruments. The Group has access to the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities and the Altice Financing Guarantee Facilities, which are subject to maintenance covenants. The incurrence covenants terms of the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities are no more restrictive than the incurrence covenants contained in other debt instruments. The Issuer is a holding company with no direct source of operating income. Therefore, the Issuer will be dependent on payments from its operating subsidiaries under certain proceeds loans to meet its liquidity requirements.

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities is largely explained by an increase of the operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 and a decrease in the income tax paid compared to income tax paid during the year ended December 31, 2019.

The increase in cash used by investing activities is largely explained by the increase of the advances paid to affiliated companies during the year ended December 31, 2020.

In addition it includes the proceeds for the sales of ATS France, ACS and FOT Business to Altice France for €178 million, €66 million and €481 million, respectively.

This has enabled us to (1) develop strong positions in multiple play segments as selling various services as part of bundles has become a growing trend in the markets in which we operate and (2) grow our market share in mobile telephony across our markets (Portugal, Israel, Dominican Republic and other geographies). _Pay Television_ Cable is the leading platform to distribute pay television in Western Europe and the United States, with a few exceptions, for example in Italy where cable has not been introduced. Technologies that compete with cable include satellite, Internet Protocol television (“IPTV”), OTT television and digital terrestrial television (“DTT”). We believe that cable has certain advantages over these technologies, notably in terms of availability of interactive features, image quality and number of channels. Cable is only matched in quality by IPTV and OTT television when these technologies are delivered over fiber-to-the-home (“FTTH”) networks. FTTH networks benefit from substantial bandwidth capabilities that are able to cope with the simultaneous provision of high-speed broadband and high-definition television services. Satellite operators distribute digital signals nationally via satellite directly to television viewers. To receive programming distributed via satellite, viewers require a satellite dish, a satellite receiver and a set top box. Pay television services provided via satellite typically require the viewers to use a conditional access smart card. Satellite distribution has certain competitive advantages over cable television services, including a broader range of programs available to a wider geographic area. However, given the lack of an integrated return path, satellite struggles to deliver easy to handle interactive television services, including VoD services, to subscribers who do not have a broadband internet connection. We believe that satellite has the following additional competitive disadvantages compared to cable: (i) higher up front cost of procuring and installing a satellite dish needed to receive programming, as compared to the “plug and play” convenience of cable television; (ii) absence of an ongoing maintenance service, which cable network operators can offer to their subscribers; (iii) satellite providers of “free to air” satellite services typically do not have strong relationships with the viewers using their service as they do not receive subscription or other fees from them; and (iv) vulnerability of satellite reception to external interference, such as adverse weather conditions. DTT based pay television packages benefit from the wide coverage of the terrestrial platform but suffer from the structurally limited number of channels available on DTT and the lack of interactive features that can be provided through cable services. Consequently, the success of pay DTT has been limited, even in geographies where free DTT is the primary television platform. IPTV and OTT television are highly attractive ways of providing television content except when they rely on digital subscriber line (“DSL”) networks. IPTV and OTT television that rely on DSL networks present a number of disadvantages compared to cable. For example, adding television services over a DSL network strains the network and decreases the amount of capacity available for other service offerings, particularly bandwidth intensive broadband internet. Under currently available technology, we believe that DSL based triple-play providers will have difficulty providing the same level of services that can be provided over fiber networks (in particular, for HDTV, viewing of TV and VoD on multiple screens or TV and VoD simultaneous viewing and recording) without having to make significant investments in extending fiber closer to the subscriber’s home. When such investments in fiber are made, notably through FTTH networks, IPTV and OTT television are able to offer high quality television to viewers. Compared to DTH services provided via cable and FTTH networks are characterized by easy to use technology, the efficient installation of customer equipment and the reliability of a protected signal delivered directly to the home. Given the trend towards offering bundled media and telecommunications services, the market share of pay television distribution is expected to benefit from cable and fiber’s ability to deliver triple-play services with high bandwidth, high-speed and bi-directional capacity. Compared to standalone DTH, namely without a broadband ----- internet connection, the number of advantages of bi-directional capabilities of digital cable television are substantial for both the users and the cable operator. Digital cable subscribers can order VoD products and use interactive television while the cable operator is able to track usage patterns and enable their customers, the television channels, to target advertising to customers more efficiently. _Broadband Internet_ The main broadband internet access technologies are DSL and cable, with DSL being the leading platform in a number of countries for historical reasons, since internet access was initially provided on telephony copper lines; however is now increasingly provided on FTTH networks. We believe that the increasing demand for very-highspeed broadband internet to cope with advanced applications, such as multi-screen and multimedia, that require higher bandwidth and greater download speeds offer a sizable growth opportunity for cable- and fiber-based technologies in the near term. Furthermore, we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the expected continued growth of the demand for very high speed internet, given that cable networks enable us to offer download speeds of at least 100 Mbps to a majority of homes passed in our footprint outside of the Dominican Republic and our cable and fiber-based networks will be able to handle the increased demand with limited additional upgrades. In contrast, many DSL based operators in some of the geographies where we operate would need to make substantial investments in fiber to meet customer needs; however it is possible, in some coverage areas, to upgrade DSL networks to fiber for a limited cost. The existing DSL infrastructure offers consumers significantly lower speeds compared to cable maximum speeds of up to approximately 300 Mbps on US DOCSIS 3.0, 360 Mbps on Euro DOCSIS 3.0 and up to 1 Gbps on FTTH networks. For most users, the actual speed provided by DSL is lower than the advertised maximum speed as the speed is dependent on the distance between end-users’ premises and DSL hubs. Furthermore, the maximum download speed of DSL networks has to be shared between broadband internet and competing simultaneous users of the line, such as IPTV. According to the “Quality of Broadband Services in the EU” report by the EC (published in October 2014 and updated as of 9 March 2021), cable and FTTx services achieved 86.5% and 83% of advertised download speeds, respectively, while DSL based services achieved only 63.3% of advertised download speed. A substantial challenge facing the expansion of FTTH or Fiber-to-the-Building (FTTB) is that introducing such technology is capital and time intensive and requires significant digging and rewiring, with the exception of certain areas and buildings where upgrades can be performed at a limited cost. Unlike DSL, cable networks are able to deliver consistent speeds irrespective of the distance to the customer. We are currently able to offer download speeds of at least 100 Mbps to a majority of homes passed in our footprint outside of the Dominican Republic. The DOCSIS 3.1 standard, which is being developed by CableLabs, is a new DOCSIS specification enabling higher spectral efficiency support of up to 10 Gbps downstream and 1 Gbps upstream speeds. DOCSIS 3.1 is expected to work on existing HFC plant and be backwardly compatible with previous DOCSIS standards. This double backward compatibility will allow a smooth migration strategy and no plant changes required to deploy DOCSIS 3.1 equipment. Furthermore, limited investment will be needed to further maximize the capacity in the future. Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line 2 (“VDSL2”) is the latest and most advanced technology for DSL broadband internet wireline communications. It was originally designed to support the wide deployment of tripleplay services such as voice, video, data, HDTV and interactive gaming and was intended to enable operators and carriers to gradually, flexibly, and cost efficiently upgrade existing xDSL infrastructure. VDSL2 allows the transmission of asymmetric and symmetric aggregate data rates of up to 200 Mbps downstream and upstream on twisted pairs using a bandwidth up to 30 MHz and further, allows for significantly lower signal deterioration caused by the distance between the cabinet and the customer’s premises when compared to older DSL technologies. VDSL2 enabled networks could theoretically allow for up to 100 Mbps at 0.4 kilometers, 40 to 50 Mbps at 0.7 kilometer and approximately 30 Mbps at 1 kilometer. On 9 March 2021, the European Commission presented a vision for Europe’s digital transformation by 2030: “The Digital Compass”. This vision for the EU's digital decade revolves around four main areas with specific targets for 2030: (i) Secure and sustainable digital infrastructures, (ii) Skills, (iii) Digital transformation of businesses and (iv) Digitalisation of public services. ----- Excellent and secure connectivity for everybody and everywhere in Europe is a prerequisite for a society in which every business and citizen can fully participate. The ambition for the Secure and sustainable digital infrastructures area is that by 2030: (i) all European households are covered by a Gigabit network, and (ii) all populated areas are covered by 5G. This vision relies on three main strategic objectives for 2025: (i) Gigabit connectivity for all of the main socioeconomic drivers, (ii) uninterrupted 5G coverage for all urban areas and major terrestrial transport paths, and (iii) access to connectivity offering at least 100 Mbps for all European households. _Fixed-line Telephony_ Traditional switched voice lines have been declining steadily in recent years as they are replaced by Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) lines. More generally, fixed-line telephony has become a commodity product that is now bundled into multiple play packages. Accordingly, fixed-line services have become dependent on the quality of the broadband internet offering and rate pricing for fixed-line telephony is now the market standard. Despite these changes, the decline in use of fixed-line telephony has been slow as most households still maintain a fixedline at home. _Mobile Telephony and Mobile Broadband Internet_ Consumption of mobile telephony and data services has continued to rise globally, driven by a growing penetration and a wider availability of smart phones. Mobile data traffic is forecasted to grow at an average rate of 46% between 2017 and 2022 according to third party sources, mainly driven by the development of smartphone devices supporting multiple wireless technologies. As mobile internet usage is mainly in the vicinity of home or office, we believe that operators’ success in the mobile telephony services business will largely rely on their ability to access a high capacity backbone with compelling mobile tower backhaul offload solutions and a strong integration of their mobile telephony offers with residential broadband based offload capabilities to cope with increasing data consumption. Despite this general trend, each mobile telephony market has a different structure and dynamic, depending on a variety of factors including, among other factors, the number of mobile network operators versus mobile virtual network operators, penetration of post-paid versus pre-paid subscription, regulation, available spectrum, and commercial strategies of operators such as handset subsidies. The success of mobile operators in the various markets is largely dependent on the overall environment and its competitive advantage. As such, we have decided to implement a versatile mobile strategy that takes advantage of the fixed mobile convergence. As part of this strategy, we operate a mobile network in Israel and we expect to benefit from synergies with our scalable cable networks in Israel. _Fixed-line Enterprise Telecom Services_ We provide business-to-business (“B2B”) telecom services, including voice and data to Enterprise customers, in a number of our geographies. We are increasingly migrating our Enterprise customers from voice-only products to integrated systems involving data connectivity, information and communications technology (“ICT”) applications and cloud-based solutions. We believe our network infrastructure and pooled experience across the Group give us a competitive advantage in this segment. _Media_ The media industry continues to shift to digital formats driven by technological advancements and changes in consumer behavior. Per International Data Corporation (“IDC”), the global advertising market was estimated to be $682 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3.3% from 2020 through 2024. As consumers have spent increasingly more time online with the rise of mobile devices, social media platforms and the proliferation of online content, the global digital advertising market has experienced rapid growth. Digital advertising growth is expected to outpace the overall advertising market as digital continues to take market share from traditional media like print and radio. Of the global advertising market, $319 billion, or 47% was attributed to global digital advertising spend. Digital advertising has increased from 36% of total advertising in 2017 and is expected to grow to 55% of total advertising by 2024. Per IDC, in the U.S., digital advertising was estimated to be $128 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 7.4% CAGR from 2020 through 2024. ----- Within the global digital advertising market, there are several segments that drive growth: - _Programmatic advertising. Programmatic advertising is the automated buying and selling of digital ads, optimizing performance and pricing through real-time signals. According to IDC, global programmatic digital ad spending was $142 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 10% CAGR from 2020 through 2024. This does not include search advertising. Within programmatic advertising, programmatic digital video advertising spending was estimated at $53 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 12.6% CAGR from 2020 through 2024. - _Mobile Advertising. For consumers, mobile is now the primary and preferred device format for consuming digital content and making purchases. According to third party sources, there are currently 14 billion mobile devices in use globally, and this is expected to expand at a 6.0% CAGR from 2020 through 2024 to an estimated 17.7 billion devices. As global mobile device growth explodes, facilitated by improved devices and connectivity, growth in mobile advertising is expected to continue. The digital mobile advertising market has grown at a 26% CAGR since 2017 to $197 billion in 2020 according to IDC and is expected to grow at a 12.7% CAGR going forward from 2020 through 2024. - _Video Ad Formats. According to IDC, in 2020 video advertising was $57 billion of the overall digital advertising market, or 18%. This is expected to increase to 20% of the total digital market by 2024 and grow at an 11% CAGR, which outpaces the market. - _Performance Advertising Growth. Performance advertising, as opposed to brand advertising, is used to achieve measurable results, including retaining an audience, generating leads, boosting sales or increasing loyalty, as a direct and immediate result of users seeing and interacting with an ad. According to IDC, the global performance advertising market was estimated to be $176 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.1% CAGR from 2020 through 2024.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

As a result of the free-to-air platforms being relatively unattractive (given their access to only six channels offered by DTT) and limited local content for free DTH, Israel’s pay television market has an estimated penetration level of approximately 62%, according to third party reports. The Israeli pay television market has been stable by the number of subscribers since 2009 at approximately 1.6 million subscribers. Similar to Western European markets, television consumer behavior in Israel is focused on digital, innovative, HDTV and interactive television services such as VoD and “start over”. Most Israeli households subscribe to pay television packages via cable or satellite, mostly digital, provided by HOT and YES, an associate of Bezeq, respectively. The established pay television operators face competition from free television (including DTT) and alternative ways of accessing television channels (such as OTT television). The competitive advantage of pay television via cable or DTH (reliability, image quality, diversified international and local language content and the ability to offer advanced interactive services among others) and the loyalty of the existing customer base lead to the pay television industry having relatively stable subscription revenues when compared to other countries where competition from other platforms is more prevalent. As of 2019, the Israeli pay television market had 1.6 million subscribers, 49.7% of which accessing through cable (HOT), 34.2% through satellite (Bezeq) and 16.1% through IPTV (Cellcom), according to third party sources. _Cable_ HOT is the sole cable operator in Israel with a network covering nearly all Israeli homes (a unique situation in OECD countries) and generates revenues principally from subscription fees paid by customers for the services provided. HOT co-develops and co-owns a number of popular shows, movies and series. It offers a number of proprietary channels as part of its packages giving them a competitive advantage. _Satellite_ Satellite television is the main alternative to cable television in Israel. Television viewers can receive free to air or paid satellite television, which is offered by YES. The ARPU generated by satellite television customers has historically expanded at a slower pace than cable ARPU. Digitalization and the emergence of a broader offering of channels and additional services will drive the ARPU development going forward. _DTT_ DTT is an alternative way of receiving television services and watching certain television channels. The penetration rates of DTT are low due to several reasons: (i) DTT offers access to fewer channels than cable channels only; (ii) there is no access to premium or thematic content, such as sports, movies or children’s programming; (iii) DTT has no interactive functionalities such as VoD or “start over”; (iv) DTT has limited capacity to transfer significant number of channels simultaneously; and (v) the quality of its transmission can be affected by weather. The expanded service will use three multiplexes up from the current one. However, we believe that cable television will maintain its advantage over DTT as the increase in the number of channels does not fundamentally address some of the key customer requirements such as interactivity and ability to choose individualized content packages, and DTT channels have struggled to be successful without the revenue generated by customer subscription charges. _Other Emerging Technologies_ We face a growing but limited competition from other technologies in Israel when compared to the European markets. Players, such as websites and online aggregators of content that deliver broadcasts OTT of existing broadband internet networks may become significant competitors in the future. The full extent to which these alternative technologies will compete effectively with our cable television system is not yet known; however we believe that the international IPTV market will have difficulty impacting the Israeli multichannel TV market due to various reasons, including: (i) the availability of certain local language content ----- available through cable or satellite only; (ii) the quality of the signal on certain DSL enabled connections located far from exchanges; (iii) the inability to access HDTV content on most DSL connections during peak times; and (iv) the ability of cable operators to bundle pay television with other fixed-line products.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Growth in the Israel broadband internet infrastructure access market has been driven by (i) the number of subscribers to broadband internet infrastructure access and (ii) a significant growth in broadband internet ARPUs. Bezeq is the leading broadband internet infrastructure access provider in Israel, with 1.7 million subscriptions as of December 31, 2018, including business and residential customers. Including business customers, Bezeq represents approximately 70% of the total broadband internet infrastructure access market by total number of subscribers as of December 31, 2018. On August 29, 2012, Bezeq announced it had decided to broaden the deployment of the optical fibers so that they will arrive as close as possible to the customers through Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) or Fiber-to-the-Building (FTTB), to form the basis for the future supply of advanced communication services and with greater bandwidth than was being provided. As of December 31, 2018, we had a market share of 30% of the broadband internet infrastructure market. What differentiates us from Bezeq is our ability to offer the highest speeds in Israel on a large scale, allowing our customers to connect several devices (such as computers, tablets and smartphones (via WiFi connection)) simultaneously without impairing the quality of television signals or the speed and quality of the internet connections. The telecom market in Israel has been opened to more competition through wholesale access, offered at a regulated price. The regulation allows internet service providers to lease infrastructure from Bezeq at a government controlled price, and offer a complete range of services including fixed voice, broadband internet and television. The wholesale market has gained strong traction since launch in the first quarter of 2015. As of September 30, 2019, Bezeq provided wholesale services to 601 thousand active lines.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The number of lines has been declining slowly, which is in line with most Western European countries where fixed-line penetration of households has declined on the back of an increase in number of individuals who use mobile phones only. Bezeq, the incumbent fixed-line telephony service provider in Israel, is the largest provider of fixed-line telephony services. In line with Western European trends, the incumbent Bezeq saw a decline in its market share over the past years. ----- The market for residential telephony in Israel faces pressure from alternative carriers, declining mobile termination and interconnection rates, as well as alternative access technologies such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) (e.g. Skype). The fixed-line telephony services have been largely a commodity and uptake has become increasingly dependent on a quality broadband internet offering by the same provider. Fixed-line telephony is increasingly included in bundles, which benefit HOT because of its ability to provide attractive bundles offerings. Fixed-line telephony has experienced some price erosion over the past few years, partly driven by a reduction in termination fees and pressure from to bundle discount, and resulted in the decline in ARPUs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,295,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE GROUP,295.165,2.4.** **Mobile Telephony,295.165.1,,"There were approximately 9.8 million mobile telephony customers in Israel as of March 31, 2021. Penetration was estimated to be 111% as of December 31, 2020, according to third party reports. There are five licensed Mobile Network Operators (“MNOs”) which offer mobile telephony services to the public and several players who operate MVNOs, although MVNOs currently have insignificant market share of the mobile telephony market. Market shares of the top three mobile operators, Cellcom, Partner Communications and Pelephone (Bezeq), have been relatively stable over the past years at approximately 25% each. New entrants like HOT Mobile (previously MIRS) were granted UMTS licenses in 2011 with services launched in the second quarter of 2012 through a combination of proprietary networks and national roaming agreements with existing operators. According to third party sources, as of March 31, 2021, HOT Mobile had approximately 1.3 million mobile subscribers, corresponding to a market share of approximately 14% compared to 4% as of December 31, 2011. The ARPU for mobile telephony subscribers of all mobile operators in Israel has declined substantially over the last decade, partly driven by a new mobile termination fee regulation in September 2010 which reduced mobile termination rates. The Israeli mobile communications market is more competitive than some of the markets in Western Europe, notably given the recent legislation, enacted in April 2012, preventing operators from charging exit fees, except in limited circumstances. As a result, the Israeli mobile market now offers fewer barriers to entry for the new mobile license owners HOT Mobile and Golan Telecom. The Israeli market features lower ARPUs than in most of the other developed markets, which makes mobile telecom services more attractive to consumers. _Mobile Broadband Internet_ Most mobile subscribers today are active 3G and 4G subscribers. Mobile operators’ network capability can be further enhanced by Long Term Evolution (“LTE”) network roll out, which enable higher speeds for mobile broadband internet. Mobile broadband internet operators, however currently only offer speeds and capacities that are significantly lower than those offered by cable and DSL operators. As a result, we believe that, in the medium term, HFC cable will be the only broadband internet infrastructure access alternative to DSL with an extensive coverage and high bandwidth for the foreseeable future.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,295,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE GROUP,295.166,3.** **Dominican Republic,295.166.1,,"_Industry Overview_ The Dominican Republic is the third largest economy in the Caribbean and Central America after Cuba and Puerto Rico, with a GDP of $78.7 billion according to the IMF in 2020, and the third largest country in terms of population after Haiti and Cuba, with a population of 10.5 million according to the IMF. According to the IMF, 32% of the population was living in the Dominican Republic’s two main cities, Santo Domingo and Santiago, in 2010. According to the IMF, between 2015 and 2019, the real GDP of the Dominican Republic grew at an average rate of 6.1%. The economy is predominantly based on services, in particular tourism. Its GDP per capita, however, is lower than other countries in the region, including Trinidad & Tobago, Panama and Costa Rica, and real GDP is expected to grow at 5.2% per annum in average between 2021 and 2025 according to the IMF. In addition, the Dominican Republic enjoys a strong commercial relationship with the United States, its largest export and import partner. These factors are expected to continue help drive personal consumption and usage of telecommunications products and services. The Dominican Republic telecommunications markets is dominated by Claro, the incumbent owned by the Mexican telecom operator America Movil, and its main challenger, Altice, in both the fixed and mobile markets. ----- Both operators own and operate multiple fixed and mobile technologies running in parallel to ensure maximum coverage and reliability to their customers. Other players in the Dominican Republic telecommunications market are relatively small, with less advanced networks and more limited coverage. These include Wind Telecom, a wireless operator, Viva, a mobile operator and Aster, a cable operator. In the broadband internet market, Altice is the second largest provider next to the incumbent Claro, our main competitor, with national market shares of approximately 62% (Claro) and 26% (Altice) as of December 2020, according to third party reports. In the mobile market, Altice Dominicana’s key competitor is Claro. _Mobile Telephony_ The mobile market is the largest telecom market in the Dominican Republic. Compared to other Western European markets, the Dominican Republic is characterized by a young population with lower purchasing power. According to third party sources, the mobile penetration rate in the Dominican Republic is approximately 83% as of 31 March 2021, lower than mobile penetration rates in Brazil, Argentina or Chile. Claro enjoys a 61% market share as of March, 2021, followed by Altice (34%). Telecom concession attributions are decided by the regulator based on certain administrative criteria and the renewal of these concessions generate no meaningful incremental fees. Frequency licenses attribution and renewal processes typically occur concomitantly with the telecom concession processes. New frequencies are tendered with several parties typically bidding and the new license attributed to the highest bidder while renewal of frequency licenses gives rise to no incremental fees for telecom operators. The regulator does not typically impose MTR reductions and favors such bilateral agreements between operators. The law provides for the possibility of MVNOs. From a telecom infrastructure standpoint, the regulator favors passive and active sharing with bilateral negotiation being the preferred route. _Pay Television, Broadband and Fixed-Line Telephony_ According to third party reports, the Dominican Republic has an estimated 33% broadband penetration rate as of March 2021 and 35% fixed voice line penetration rate as of March 2021. These penetration rates are typically lower than those measured in a number of Latin American countries and evidence significant potential for growth in the Dominican Republic according to third party reports. Mobile will play an increasingly important role, with only a limited part of broadband uptake expected to be attributable to fixed broadband. In addition, fixed-line telephony is expected to continue to decline going forward, in particular due to ongoing substitution of fixed-line by mobile services, in line with trends seen in other developed economies. The pay television market in the Dominican Republic is highly fragmented with over 6 pay television operators, although only a limited number operate a two-way network, and a handful of other players have a subscriber base exceeding 10,000. Claro and Altice together represent approximately 97% market share (59% and 38% market share respectively, according to third party sources), as of December 2018, delivering services over IPTV and DTH and cable respectively. Other smaller players include Wind through its MMDS technology. Broadband internet access is typically delivered by a mix of fixed-line infrastructure and mobile access, with the use of mobile broadband being primarily driven by the availability of fixed-line infrastructure in a given location. The broadband and fixed telephony markets are relatively concentrated, with Claro and Altice together accounting for the large majority of the broadband market and of the fixed telephony market). Claro delivers broadband services through its xDSL and FTTx networks, while Altice uses its xDSL and cable infrastructure. Both Claro and Altice offer fixed-line telephony services using VoiP and Public Switched Telephone Network (“PSTN”). Other smaller players have a limited presence, with e.g., Wind Telecom’s wireless technology. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,295,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE GROUP,295.167,DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS Overview,295.167.2,,"We are a multinational broadband and mobile communications, content and media group operating in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic. We have major positions in a number of segments of the telecommunications markets in which we operate, including residential fixed, residential mobile and business services, which includes B2B services and wholesale, and also offer other services, which includes media, content and advertisement services. In the geographies in which we operate, we are either the largest or the second largest fixed services provider, and a leading provider of multi-play services offering bundled triple-play (“3P”) services and, where possible, quad-play (“4P”) services and focus our marketing on our multi-play offerings. We are also the largest mobile operator in Portugal, the second largest mobile operator in the Dominican Republic, and a significant competitor to the three largest mobile operators in Israel. As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately 10,159,000 total mobile B2C subscribers and approximately 3,011,000 total fixed B2C unique customers as well as a fiber network passing approximately 8,707,000 homes in our footprint (including homes accessed through wholesale fiber operators). Our service portfolio in each of the regions in which we operate is set forth below under “— _Overview of Service Portfolio”._ The Group was created through a number of price-disciplined acquisitions of telecommunications businesses, including: PT Portugal in Portugal, HOT in Israel, and Altice Dominicana in the Dominican Republic. Our acquisition strategy has allowed us to target fiber/cable and mobile operators with what we believe to be highquality networks in markets we find attractive from an economic, competitive and regulatory standpoint and create value at the acquired businesses by implementing operational improvements and leveraging economies of scale, as well as pursuing in-market consolidation and attractive diversification with B2B, DSL and mobile add-on opportunities. Furthermore, this has enabled us to grow the acquired businesses organically while we continue to focus on cost optimization and increasing economies of scale and operational synergies as our Group develops. Moreover, as part of our strategy, we also focus on the convergence of telecommunications, media, content and advertising to offer more value to our customers. For example, since June 2017 we have owned Teads, which is a leading video advertising marketplace with, as of April 2021, 1.9 billion unique monthly users worldwide. In Portugal, in February 2017, we acquired a 25% stake in the capital of sports broadcaster SPORT TV. We have invested in high quality cable and fiber-based network infrastructure which allows us to offer advanced multi-play and high bandwidth services in a vast majority of our service areas. Our fixed-line services in Portugal are primarily delivered over FTTH, DSL and DTH, in Israel are primarily delivered over HFC cables (and since April 2021, fiber-based internet services are also delivered over IBC Israel’s fiber optic network in certain areas where the network had already been deployed) and in the Dominican Republic are delivered over both HFC cable and FTTH, in each case that are among the most technically advanced in the markets in which we operate. Our cable networks enable us to offer download speeds of at least 200 Mbps to a majority of homes passed in our footprint in Israel and the Dominican Republic. We believe that our cable networks are well positioned for future technological developments, while the fiber networks in Portugal are already set up to provide download speeds of up to 1 Gbps. We are focused on increasing our investment in fiber in Portugal. We own 50.01% of FastFiber, comprising all of our fiber assets in Portugal, including FTTH and dark fiber, which was created in April 2020 in partnership with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners. Through FastFiber, we rolled out over 388,000 new fiber homes passed in 2018, 356,000 new fiber homes passed in 2019, 603,000 new fiber homes passed in 2020 and a further 73,000 new fiber homes passed in the three months ended March 31, 2021. Throughout our geographies, we are working to expand our fiber network. In Israel, in February 2021, we acquired a 23.3% stake in IBC Israel. In Portugal and the Dominican Republic, we continue to upsell our fiber/cable based services to our existing DSL subscriber base. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, we generated residential fixed revenues of €631 million in Portugal, €563 million in Israel and €91 million in the Dominican Republic. We operate an extensive mobile network, which provides 4G coverage for 99.6% of the population of Portugal, 99.9% of the population of Israel and 97.5% of the population of the Dominican Republic, in each case, as of March 31, 2021. In addition, we have relationships with the industry’s significant mobile equipment providers and are able to offer customers top-of-the-market mobile equipment. In 2018, we completed the Towers Transactions, through which we monetized the value of our passive mobile infrastructure assets in Portugal and the Dominican Republic. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, we generated residential mobile revenues of €463 million in Portugal, €210 million in Israel and €263 million in the Dominican Republic. ----- Further, we are in various stages of bidding for and investing in 5G spectrum in all jurisdictions in which we operate our mobile services. Following the completion of the 5G spectrum auction in Israel in August 2020, HOT along with Partner was awarded two bands of 700 MHz (10 MHz each band), two bands of 2,600 MHz (20 MHz each band) and 10 bands of 3,500 MHz (10 MHz each band). After completion of the required preconditions, on September 29, 2020 the spectrums were allocated to HOT and HOT’s license was amended to allow the operation of 5G network. We launched 5G services in the first quarter of 2021 in certain areas in Israel. In Portugal, the 5G spectrum auction started on December 22, 2020 and the main auction is ongoing. The expected allocation of rights of use for frequencies is scheduled for the third quarter of 2021. In the Dominican Republic, the 5G spectrum auction started on February 9, 2021 and the auction is ongoing. The expected allocation of rights of use for frequencies is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect to participate in both of these auctions. In furtherance of our convergence strategy, we are focused on delivering high quality content offerings to complement our fixed and mobile services, including producing proprietary content, including live broadcasts of sports events and other sports- and lifestyle-related programs as well as the sports programming for which the Group has acquired broadcasting rights. For instance, this strategy is evidenced by our investment in SPORT TV for broadcasting premium sports content in Portugal. In July 2020, PT OpCo entered into a new distribution agreement with SPORT TV for a four-season period, pursuant to which PT Portugal committed to pay a noncontingent fixed price plus an additional variable fee component based on the number of subscribers and penetration rate. Between the end of 2015 and early 2016, we had entered into various agreements with other telecom operators and football clubs in Portugal to acquire reciprocal or exclusive broadcasting rights, including a sponsorship agreement with F.C. Porto. In Israel, we have entered into commitments to purchase content, mainly channels. We have also entered into various arrangements with Altice France Group’s Altice TV division, including non-exclusive distribution rights in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic of Netflix and Discovery channels. We intend to continue to selectively invest in local and value-added premium content as well as sports broadcasting and distribution rights in the future to differentiate our convergent communication services from those of our competitors. Through Teads, the digital advertising business acquired in 2017, we operate a leading, cloud-based, end-to-end technology platform that enables programmatic digital advertising for a global, curated ecosystem of quality advertisers and their agencies and quality publishers. Teads operates in the Open Web outside of the Walled Gardens. As an end-to-end solution, Teads’ platform consists of buy-side, sell-side, creative, data and artificial intelligence optimization modules. As a result, Teads has built deep partnerships with both the demand and supply sides of digital advertising. For advertisers and their agencies, Teads’ platform offers a single access point to buy the inventory of many of the world’s best publishers. Through exclusive partnerships with these premium publishers, Teads enables customers to reach 1.9 billion unique monthly users (as of April 2021), while improving the efficiency, quality and cost of digital ad transactions. For approximately 3,100 publishers, Teads is a trusted monetization partner, providing the technology required to monetize their most valuable ad inventory programmatically. By connecting both sides through Teads’ integrated platform, known as the _Teads Global _Media Platform, Teads solves the digital programmatic advertising industry’s most significant problems related_ to value chain fragmentation, inefficient digital advertising pricing and quality and scale of inventory. Teads refers to the ecosystem enabled by Teads Global Media Platform as the Curated Internet. As of March 31, 2021, Teads had approximately 3,100 editorial publishers on its platform, representing more than 15,000 web and app properties that provide access to more than one trillion ad opportunities every year. Teads’ number of customers, defined as customers who spent at least $1,000 in the trailing 12-month period, grew to approximately 2,000 as of December 31, 2020. Teads’ retention rate of customers who spent above $150,000 with Teads in the prior period compared to those same customers in the current period irrespective of their spending (the “Gross Customer Retention Rate”) was 94% for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020. For more information, see “—Other Services—Media”. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, we generated revenues from Teads of €488 million. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, the Group generated total consolidated revenues of €4,088 million, of which, without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, €2,148 million, €981 million, €475 million and €488 million was contributed by our Portugal, Israel, Dominican Republic and Teads segments, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of €1,575 million, of which, without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, €828 million, €343 million, €233 million and €177 million was contributed by our Portugal, Israel, Dominican Republic and Teads segments, respectively. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

As an end-to-end solution, the Teads platform consists of buy-side, sell-side, creative, data and artificial intelligence optimization modules. We offer a variety of services over our fixed-line and mobile infrastructure, including, but not limited to, pay TV, broadband internet access, fixed-line telephony and mobile telephony to our residential customers, and, to a lesser extent and depending on the geography, telecom services to our business services customers. We also provide wholesale services across all our geographies (except international wholesale voice carrier business in Portugal ----- and the Dominican Republic, which was sold to Tofane Global in 2018). We track the performance of our business by geography and further analyze our revenues by operational activity. From January 1, 2020, we present revenue by activity under “Residential-Fixed”, “Residential-Mobile”, “Residential Equipment”, “Business Services” and “Media”. Prior to January 1, 2020, we presented revenue by activity under “Residential-Fixed”, “ResidentialMobile”, “Business Services” and “Media” (with revenue from equipment sales included under “ResidentialFixed” and “Residential-Mobile”, as applicable). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Condition and Results of Operations of the Group—Basis of Presentation—Operational Activities” for a_ discussion of our revised presentation of our operational activities. Our fixed-based services (high-quality pay TV, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony) are provided over our cable- and fiber-based network infrastructure which are either DOCSIS 3.0, DOCSIS 2.0 or DSL FTTH enabled, offering download speeds of between 30 Mbps and 1 Gbps depending on geography. As of March 31, 2021, our fiber network passed 8,707,000 homes (including homes accessed through wholesale fiber operators), with 3,011,000 total fixed B2C unique customers. We also offer mobile-based services in the geographies in which we operate, through 2G, 3G and 4G Long-Term-Evolution (“4G-LTE”) technology, and we had 10,159,000 total mobile B2C subscribers (of which 5,008,000 were post-paid customers) as of March 31, 2021. We are also focused on delivering high quality content offerings to complement our fixed and mobile services, including proprietary content and exclusive content. For more information regarding our content offerings, see “—Other Services—Content” below. In all geographies in which we operate, we are focused on the convergence of fixed and mobile services by crossselling and up-selling our offerings to further increase our multi-play penetration. Our cable, fiber and mobile technologies enable us to offer premium digital services, attractive interactive features (such as our “Meo Go!” offering in Portugal) and high-quality content. We have leveraged our network advantage to drive our multi-play strategy and offer an attractive combination of content, speed and functionality. We offer our residential customers bundled double- and triple-play services, and also quad-play services in Portugal, comprising of a combination of TV, broadband internet access and fixed-line telephony services at what we believe are attractive prices. We believe the demand for our multi-play packages is primarily driven by the inherent quality of the various products included in them, which we believe are among the best available in the markets in which we operate. Although we believe our products offer the best value for money and cost-savings for customers when purchased as part of multi-play packages, we typically also offer most of these services on a stand-alone basis in most of our geographies. We use a variety of brands, trade names and trademarks to market our services, and, in each case, several associated trademarks.

1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,295,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE GROUP,295.171,Fixed Services,295.171.2,Pay TV,"Across our geographies, we offer digital television services which include basic and premium programming, and, in most markets, incremental product and service offerings such as enhanced pay-per-view programming, spanning from VoD to near-VoD (“NVoD”), digital video recorders (“DVR”), HDTV services and, in some cases, exclusive content. Our cable networks enable us to offer interactive digital services to most of our customers. Our pay TV offerings include content and channels purchased from a variety of local and foreign producers and we continue to focus on broadcasting high-quality content over all of our cable networks. To ensure we cater to local demand for content, we tailor both our basic and additional channel offerings to each country of operation according to culture, demographics, programming preferences and local regulation. See “—Other Services— _Content”. Portugal_ In Portugal, our television strategy is based on a multi-platform concept that aims to provide consistent content and user experiences across television, personal computers (“PCs”) and mobile phones. “MEO” is our TV brand across the various platforms, primarily at home (through IPTV and satellite), mobile telephones (through Meo Go! Mobile) or PCs (through Meo Go!) and Apple TV and Android TV. MEO_ provides access to a comprehensive content offering, with more than 200 TV and radio channels and thousands of VoD titles, most of which are offered in full HD 1080p resolution. We offer tiered packages of channels, as well as on-demand availability that can be subscribed for, in real time, directly through the TV set. MEO also provides access to advanced features, such as network digital recording pause live-TV and seven day restart and catchup TV for most of the channel grid. The set-top boxes in the MEO service are all HD-compliant, using MPEG4. We were the first operator in Portugal to introduce HDTV and a 4K experience in pay TV. In March 2018, we launched (i) a 4K WiFi portable set top box more easily adjusted to the customer’s needs in each home division, (ii) a new TV interface, which is based on content discovery, personalization and speed, including, among others, features that allow customers to access more easily their most viewed channels and recently viewed programs and to select programs based on theme and type of content and (iii) a new customer digital experience, including a new Video Chat. In 2020, MEO was one of the few operators to have launched TV services in Apple TV and Android TV OTT SetTop boxes, providing a unique user interface, while maintaining appreciated features like Fast Zapping and personalized services like Continue Watching. ----- Our quad-play offer of converged fixed-mobile services by MEO includes TV, broadband, fixed telephone and mobile telephone services under the brand “M4O”. MEO designed this product after studying trends in the Portuguese market which revealed increasing consumer preference for quad-play services all reflected on the same invoice, a desire to include the entire family in a single plan and the importance of high-quality connectivity to the internet. The entry-level M4O currently offers approximately 150 TV channels, 100 Mbps broadband speed, unlimited national calls and 1,000 minutes to 50 international destinations, as well as one to four mobile SIM cards, including free of charge calls (500 minutes), text messages to all wireline and wireless networks and 500 MB of mobile data, using our 3G and 4G networks. There are three additional M4O offers, with higher fixed internet speeds and mobile internet allowances. The high end offer is the recently launched “M4O Giga”, with 1 Gbps broadband speed and 10 GB of mobile data. There is also the “M5O Giga” plan, a multi-play offering which, in addition to increased mobile data allowances, also includes up to 30 GB of mobile broadband. MEO was the first operator to launch Giga offers, supported on the most advanced router on the Portuguese market, providing 10x faster WiFi. MEO was the first player in Portugal to launch convergence offers, in 2013 through a quad-play offer, and according to ANACOM currently leads the market of bundle offers, both for quad play and triple-play offers. In May 2018, we launched MEO BY, an innovative and entirely digital offer that allows customers to customize their MEO package based on their preferences and needs, with no mandatory loyalty period, representing an extremely flexible offer with more than 16,000 possible combinations between fixed and mobile communications, fixed and mobile internet and television services. MEO’s content offering includes thousands of VoD titles and a variety of interactive offerings based on anchor programs. For example, we offer more than 70 interactive applications which focus on news, sports and music, other interactive portals such as our children’s portal which provides access to combined VoD, music, games and educational content tailored to children audiences, as well as “red button” interactive applications (whereby viewers press a button on their remote controls to receive additional interactive services) often linked to popular TV programs. Between the end of 2015 and early 2016, we acquired broadcasting rights for new sports programming in Portugal, including exclusive broadcasting rights to the F.C. Porto matches in the Portuguese Premier League, and in July 2016, we reached an agreement with certain other Portuguese telecom operators, such as NOS Comunicações, NOS Audiovisuais, Vodafone Portugal and Cabovisão (currently Nowo), for the reciprocal sharing of broadcasting rights of football-related content for a period of eight years. See “—Significant _Contracts—Portugal—Contracts with football clubs” for more information. Additionally, we have entered into_ various arrangements with Altice France Group’s Altice TV division, including non-exclusive distribution rights in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic of Netflix and Discovery channels. In November 2018, we launched a new SVOD MEO Films & Series service aimed at broadcasting exclusive and other important series. Throughout the years 2017 and 2018, we added new channels to our portfolio, some of which are provided exclusively by us. _Israel_ We are the largest provider of pay TV services in Israel based on number of subscribers. We offer primarily digital television services in Israel under the “HOT” brand. Our standard digital television package consists of 95 base television channels and certain radio channels and gives customers the option to purchase extra content packages which give access to additional channels. We believe our standard offering includes more channels than that offered by our competitors and we offer a range of Israeli and international sports, current affairs, entertainment, music, film, documentaries, children, and adult channels, as well as channels in Arabic and Russian to address demand from the culturally diverse population of Israel. Our standard package includes the HOT suite of channels and others such as Eurosport, Fox News, MTV HITS and Zee TV as well as all the “must carry” channels that we are required to carry on our network under existing regulation. We regularly update our standard digital television package to reflect changes in viewer interest. Our higher-end packages include all six of our extra content packages as standard and exclude premium channels such as premium sport channels and other channels which are marketed à la carte, depending on the subscription. We also offer up to 57 television channels in HD. In addition to a high-quality and diversified linear television offering, we offer our customers a variety of advanced services featuring interactivity. These are available to customers whether or not they also purchase our broadband internet services. In all of our digital television packages we provide customers with a replay service for certain television channels, enabling a viewer who misses the start of a program to replay it while the broadcast is in progress (“start over”), as well as “start next” service, enabling the viewer to start watching the next show prior to its scheduled broadcast. Our digital television offering also includes an extensive VoD library containing ----- approximately 50,000 titles as of March 31, 2021. In addition, we offer access to additional content libraries not included in our standard VoD service on either a pay-per-view or monthly subscription basis. In the pay-TV market, the Group’s main competitor is D.B.S. Satellite Services (1998) Ltd, a subsidiary of Bezeq, which provides satellite technology-based television services under the brand “YES”. According to an order issued by the Israeli Ministry of Communications, from February 23, 2014 until February 24, 2019, we and the local satellite company “YES” were required to offer a fixed-price, narrow-base package at a price not to exceed NIS 120 (approximately €28) per month. Although such obligation was not extended, according to the Cable and Satellite Council’s decision dated March 27, 2019, we and “YES” are entitled to continue to offer our customers narrow packages at our option, for one year. Recently, HOT has sent a notice to the Cable and Satellite Council about its intention to offer a narrow package (without sport channels). We bolster our Israeli pay TV service offering by significant investments in procurement and co-development of original local content which we undertake in partnership with local production partners and broadcast on our proprietary suite of channels. We package such original and purchased content into a range of television channels that we own and broadcast under the “HOT” brand to our television customers. The HOT suite of channels includes HOT 3, HOT 8 where we broadcast our co-developed local content, HOT HBO, four movie channels, the Israeli Entertainment Channel, sports channels and more than 10 children’s channels, which we believe are highly popular in Israel, and run shows with top television ratings such as Zaguri Empire, Very Important Person, Asfur, The Arbitrator, Shababnikim, Juda, Foolish, Golestar, Connected and Malcote. We also purchase rights to broadcast popular foreign channels over our network. We believe the quality of content we provide over our network generally, and the HOT television channels in particular, has been a critical factor in attracting new customers, maintaining our existing customers and minimizing churn. Under existing regulations, we are subject to certain ownership restrictions that limit the number of television channels we are permitted to own. In addition, we are required by regulation to invest a minimum of 8% of our annual pay TV revenues from subscriber fees in the production of original local content. In 2017, we launched internet-based content packages intended to be viewed using smartphones, tablets and computers under the Next TV brand, which include our local productions, movies and leading foreign series. As of August 2017, we have also been marketing an internet-based content package which in addition to local and foreign contents also includes over 40 channels for direct viewing, and may also be viewed on a television set. Recently, HOT has launched a new OTT service, HOT TV, which is carried on the fiber network and is a full service offering which includes the entire content offering of HOT, including all the linear channels and the VOD service. _Dominican Republic_ We offer pay television services through our HFC and FTTH broadband and xDSL networks and we also launched our DTH TV services in regional areas covered by our mobile network in May 2017 enabling us to provide these services near-nationwide. Our HFC and FTTH broadband networks, which pass through densely populated urban areas, enable us to offer interactive digital services to most of our customers. In addition, we provide GPON-based services to our high-value residential customers. We offer over 300 channels through a choice of five different plans. Of those channels, approximately 60 are available in HD for basic packages with another 30 premium addon channels (such as HBO, Fox and MLB) available in HD for an additional fee, which we believe represents one of the most extensive HD offerings available in the Dominican Republic as of March 31, 2021. Further, Altice Dominicana is the exclusive distributor of NBA League Pass and NBA Channel. Pursuant to the agreement with NBA, Altice Dominicana has full distribution rights in cable, TV Everywhere and DTH for access to residential subscribers. In addition, Altice Dominicana is the exclusive rights holder of the NBA’s OTT mobile app NBA TV, for commercialization to mobile subscribers on a la carte basis for postpaid mobile users, and also as a payas-you go for prepaid mobile users under the paquetico/recharge scheme. _Others_ We also offer our broadband internet subscribers IPTV services via an unbundled xDSL network.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,295,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE GROUP,295.171,Fixed Services,295.171.3,Broadband Internet Access and Fixed-Line Telephony,"We provide broadband internet access and fixed-line telephony services across our cable (and in certain areas xDSL) footprint, with a majority of homes passed outside of the Dominican Republic benefitting from download speeds of at least 100 Mbps, and with a majority of homes passed in the Dominican Republic benefitting from ----- download speeds of at least 200 Mbps. In the short-to-medium term, we expect that the portions of our networks that are DOCSIS 3.0-enabled can offer download speeds of up to 500 Mbps with limited network and customer premises equipment upgrades given the existing technological capability of our networks. This technological capability can be realized with relatively low levels of capital expenditure and will enable us to better meet the needs of our residential and business services customers who demand higher download speeds. Our fixed-line telephony services are based on either PacketCable or VoIP technologies. We offer a wide range of telephony packages and our triple-play offers tend to include flat-rate telephony packages with a significant number of minutes of use included in the price. We provide national and international connectivity to our customers either through our own interconnection capabilities or through our partners. We intend to phase out stand-alone telephony packages as our strategy is to offer fixed-line telephony as an add-on product in our multiplay packages. _Portugal_ Pursuant to our fiber rollout strategy in Portugal we reached 5,699,000 fiber homes passed as of March 31, 2021, including 450,000 homes passed pursuant to our fiber sharing agreement with Vodafone Portugal (which is further described below under “—Significant Contracts—Portugal—Fiber Sharing Agreement with Vodafone Portugal”). In April 2020, we transferred our fiber assets including FTTH and dark fiber to FastFiber. On April 17, 2020, we disposed of a 49.99% interest in FastFiber to Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners. In Portugal, we have also tested NG-PON2 technology and despite the positive technical results of NG-PON2, XGS-PON became the industry choice due to the better cost effectiveness. During 2021 the first commercial tests will be done with a small group of friendly customers. Over the last decade, total traffic for fixed-line telephony on our fixed-line network has decreased, primarily because consumers have increasingly used mobile services instead of fixed-line services and due to the migration of dial-up internet users to Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines (“ADSL”). The number of active mobile SIM cards exceeds the number of fixed-line main lines in Portugal. We have responded to this trend by encouraging the use of our fixed-line network for bundled services, including triple-play packages that include fixed-line telephone services, broadband internet access and pay TV services. Additionally, we are required to provide carrier selection to our customers for all kinds of traffic. Carrier selection has been an additional factor that has contributed to the reduction in traffic on our network. _Israel_ Internet service in Israel is structured into two segregated elements comprised of infrastructure or network access services and ISP services. Infrastructure access service relates to access to the physical network infrastructure within Israel that is required to connect the customer’s device to the infrastructure access provider’s operator. This service is provided by us and Bezeq, the only telecommunication operators in Israel that own a national fixed-line network infrastructure. In addition, Partner and Cellcom offer infrastructure access internet service in certain areas over fiber optic infrastructures. ISP services, which can be provided by any licensed provider, consist of providing access to the customer from the infrastructure provider’s operator, through its own operator, to the local and global internet network. ISPs generally also provide certain value-added services such as data protection services, security solutions, e-mail services and system administration services. A customer wishing to subscribe to internet services in Israel effectively needs to purchase each of these services and may choose to subscribe to the broadband internet infrastructure access facilities of us or Bezeq while using a separate ISP provider. Under the terms of our ISP license, we are required to provide ISP services to any customer, including to customers of other broadband internet infrastructure access providers, on equal terms. In October 2020, the Israeli Ministry of Communications published a hearing according to which Bezeq and HOT’s licenses will be amended so that they will be entitled to provide a full internet service including infrastructure and ISP service, subject to certain terms as detailed in the hearing. On February 22, 2021, the Israeli Ministry of Communications published a secondary hearing which includes certain amendments, including with respect to the effective date and the interim period. To date, no final decision has been published on the subject. Further, since February 2015 Bezeq and HOT are required to provide wholesale services to service providers, which enable them to offer a full internet service to their end-users (infrastructure and ISP services). In June 2017, the Israeli Ministry of Communications set the maximum tariffs for the provision of wholesale services over HOT’s network. On December 30, 2019, the Israeli Ministry of Communications published a hearing regarding its intent to change the maximum tariffs method. In June 2020, the Israeli Ministry of Communications approved HOT’s updated proposal for wholesale tariffs. ----- We offer ultra-fast broadband internet infrastructure access services to our residential customers under our “HOT” brand over our DOCSIS 3.0-enabled cable network which can support download speeds of up to 500 Mbps with new customer premises equipment. Currently we offer our customers download speeds ranging from 200 Mbps to 500 Mbps at competitive prices and our customers can choose from our single, double and triple-play packages which include broadband internet infrastructure access services along with our television and fixed-line telephony services. We provide ISP services under the “HOTnet” brand. Unlike our competitors who generally offer ISP services at prices that increase depending on access speeds, we offer our ISP services at a competitive monthly flat-rate irrespective of access speeds, which we believe make our ISP offerings very attractive. As of July 2020, we are permitted to provide ISP services as part of a package together with our other multi-play packages, subject to the approval of the Ministry of Communications for such packages. As of April 2021, we also offer fiber-based internet services in speeds of up to 1 Gbps over IBC Israel’s (an entity in which HOT acquired a 23.3% stake in September 2020) fiber optic network in certain areas where the network had already been deployed. See “–Significant Contracts–Israel–Agreement with IBC Israel” for more information. Fixed-line telephony in Israel is segregated into two separate services comprised of domestic fixed-line telephony services and international long-distance services, each of which requires a separate license. We are currently licensed to provide both. Our domestic license is valid until 2023 and our international license is valid until 2032, and both may be extended for additional ten-year periods subject to the approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications. We provide fixed-line telephony services using PacketCable technology on our secure cable network by offering individual lines to our residential customers under our “HOT” brand, either on a stand-alone basis or as part of our multi-play packages. Our services include several ancillary value-added features for end users such as caller identity, call waiting and call waiting with caller identity, “follow me” (a call forwarding service enabling the user to be reached on several phone numbers), conference calling, last call return, blocking of calls with no caller identity, blocking of caller identity for outgoing calls and voicemail services. _Dominican Republic_ In the Dominican Republic, we offer consumers broadband and fixed-line telephony services over our HFC, FTTH broadband and xDSL networks. Our HFC and FTTH broadband networks which are 95.4% Docsis 3.0-enabled, passed 833,600 homes in densely populated urban areas as of March 31, 2021, enabling us to offer current download speeds of up to 200 Mbps, with launch of download speeds of up to 300 Mbps from the second quarter of 2021. We selectively deployed new customer premise equipment in the first half of 2018 in order to support our broadband internet service to eligible customers which increased download speeds up to 200 Mbps and can also support further increases in download speeds up to 400 Mbps in the medium term. We also plan to leverage the large spectrum allocations available to Altice Dominicana, which are technology neutral and enable high mobile broadband speeds, by rolling out fixed wireless broadband access services through LTE and WTTX, in regional areas covered by our mobile network to complement our broadband services over our HFC and FTTH broadband networks concentrated in urban areas, thereby offering near-nationwide broadband coverage. We offer both pre- and post-paid fixed-line telephony plans. While we continue to utilize our xDSL network to provide fixed-line telephony services, we also offer VoIP to homes passed by our HFC and FTTH broadband networks. We also leverage our wireless network to transmit fixed-line voice services.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,295,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE GROUP,295.172,Mobile Services,295.172.1,Residential,"We offered mobile services to approximately 10,159,000 total mobile B2C subscribers across our geographies as of March 31, 2021. In Israel, due to regulations, previously we only offered our mobile services either on a stand ----- alone basis or in a bundle with ISP or international call services. According to a regulatory amendment as of February 2021, we are entitled to include our mobile services in our other multi-services packages, subject to the approval of the Ministry of Communications for such packages. On May 30, 2021, the Ministry of Communications approved the marketing of quad-play packages including triple-play services with HOT Net’s ISP services and HOT Mobile’s mobile cellular services. _Portugal_ In Portugal, in our residential customer segment, we offer a range of mobile products and services including: (i) a variety of voice and data tariff plans, both prepaid and post-paid, designed to integrate unlimited voice and data plans targeted at high-value post-paid customers and, in the prepaid market, to discourage migration to low-value tariff plans by offering additional voice and data services; (ii) a portfolio of smartphones, including exclusive handsets, with the capability to use an array of value-added and convergent services (mobile TV, music on demand, navigation app, social network aggregator, cloud storage, etc.); and (iii) mobile broadband offers of up to 400 Mbps speed, using 4G technology and offering free access to our national WiFi network. We also offer prepaid and discount products, which remain popular. As of March 31, 2021, approximately 46.2% of our Mobile B2C subscribers were using prepaid mobile products in Portugal. Our 4G offering currently allows: (i) speeds of up to 400 Mbps; (ii) access to live TV channels through Meo Go!, a service that allows access to live TV channels on PCs, tablets, smartphones, Apple TV and Android TV set-top boxes, complementary broadband coverage through ADSL/DTH, enabling customers to access our high speed mobile broadband network in areas outside of our FTTH footprint; (iii) multi-play customers to access an extensive catalog of music tracks through our multi-platform music streaming service, Meo _Music; (iv) Multi-SIM, for sharing of traffic among various devices, including PCs, through wireless dongles, tablets and smartphones; and (v) Meo Drive, a navigation app available in iOS and Android marketplaces. Our 4G and 4G+ services are respectively available to 99.6% and 89.6% of the Portuguese population as of March 31, 2021. Following the launch of the M4O quad-play offering, MEO repositioned its voice and data tariff plans as a result of which we offer four unlimited voice and tiered data bundles in the post-paid category, at different price points: (i) the unlimited S, offering 500 MB of mobile internet, unlimited voice/SMS plus 250 minutes or SMS on all other networks; (ii) the unlimited M, offering 1 GB of mobile internet plus unlimited voice and SMS and 500 minutes or SMS on all other networks; (iii) the unlimited L, offering 3 GB of mobile internet plus unlimited voice and SMS on all networks; and (iv) the unlimited XL, offers 30 GB of mobile internet plus unlimited voice and SMS. All of these plans include unlimited WiFi access, which otherwise costs an additional fee. In the prepaid market, MEO extended its daily and weekly tariff plans offering a range of tariff plans from “zero obligations” (daily plans without inclusive data) to frequent user plans (billed weekly with inclusive minutes and SMS), in which the customer can choose add-on data services for a fee, to address consumers who opt not to enter into post-paid loyalty contracts. MEO also extended the Moche offering targeted at customers below the age of 25. The _Moche_ tariff plans include minutes and SMS and enables the customer to choose a variety of data allowances for different prices, and include traffic to a number of apps, including WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram. MEO’s tariff structure was established in response to price movements in the market and is aimed at maintaining MEO’s competitive position in the market. We believe that mobile services in Portugal are priced lower than the European average and are among the lowest in Europe. Fixed-to-mobile and mobile-to-mobile interconnection charges are regulated by ANACOM and have a significant impact on our business. Since 2005, when ANACOM declared all mobile operators to have significant market power in call termination in the mobile networks market, ANACOM has accordingly imposed price controls on interconnection rates for the termination of calls on mobile networks. Since the imposition of price controls, interconnection rates have been reduced steadily. ANACOM has issued successive decisions that have reduced mobile termination rates over time. In March 2012, ANACOM issued a decision reducing mobile termination rates progressively to €0.0127/min by December 2012. In August 2015, ANACOM issued a further decision approving an additional reduction to €0.0083/min. ANACOM further reduced the mobile termination rates to €0.0081/min. as of July 2016 and €0.0075/min. as of July 2017. On July 21, 2018, ANACOM approved its decision regarding the specification on price control obligations in the wholesale market for voice termination on individual mobile networks (Market 2/2014). The maximum price to be applied by the three mobile operators considered to have significant market power was set at €0.42/min., billed per second from the first second and independent of the origin of the call. From July 1, 2019, that price decreased to €0.40/min., following the yearly update of the inputs used in the model to determine such price. Moreover, on September 18, 2018, ANACOM issued a decision reducing the fixed termination rate to €0.00047/min. In ----- February 2020, ANACOM issued a decision fixing the call termination rate on fixed networks at €0.046 from October 2020, and the call termination rate on mobile networks at €0.36 from July 2020. These reductions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our interconnection revenues. _Israel_ We provide mobile services in Israel to residential customers under the “HOT Mobile” brand mainly on our 5G, UMTS and LTE networks. HOT Mobile competes with several principal mobile network operators, including Cellcom, Partner, Pelephone and Golan Telecom, and MVNOs. The telecom market in Israel has changed significantly in recent years to become more fragmented, including nine players in the mobile market, underlying an increase of competition. Due to regulations, previously we only offered our mobile services either on a stand-alone basis or in a bundle with ISP or international call services. According to a regulatory amendment as of February 2021, we are entitled to include our mobile services in our other multi-services packages, subject to the approval of the Ministry of Communications for such packages. On May 30, 2021, the Ministry of Communications approved the marketing of quad-play packages including triple-play services with HOT Net’s ISP services and HOT Mobile’s mobile cellular services. We offer residential subscribers packages of local calls (subject to fair usage), text messaging and internet access for what we believe to be an attractive and competitive monthly fixed price as well as international calls to selected destinations for an attractive fee. Prices for these services are subject to changes, predominantly driven by the competitive nature of the Israeli telecommunications market. We also offer users pay-as-you-use packages, which charge customers on a per-unit-used basis. Since the launch of our UMTS-based 3G mobile services in May 2012 and the launch of our UMTS prepaid services in April 2015, we added approximately 1,685,180 UMTS and LTE subscribers in the residential market as of March 31, 2021. _Dominican Republic_ In the Dominican Republic, we currently offer 2G, 3G and/or 4G-LTE services on a variety of pay-as-you-go and monthly plans, from “no frills” offers with no commitment or handset, to premium mobile telephony offers with varying voice and data limits, if any, at attractive prices. We are a pioneer in unlimited data and offer a comprehensive range of data plans up to 125 GB, free unlimited data for social apps and exclusive access to premium Over The Top Content apps such as HBO GO, NBA League Pass, Altice Music, and the VoD/OTT proprietary Altice Play app, which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2019. In the pre-paid mobile segment, our strategy focusses on a volume-driven approach aimed at increasing top-up frequency and value while maintaining a healthy rate of customer growth.

As a result, we have built deep partnerships with both the demand and supply sides of digital advertising. For advertisers and their agencies, our platform offers a single access point to buy the inventory of many of the world’s best publishers. Through exclusive partnerships with these premium publishers, we enable customers to reach 1.9 billion unique monthly users (as of April 2021),while improving the efficiency, quality and cost of digital ad transactions. For approximately 3,100 publishers, we are a trusted monetization partner, providing the technology required to monetize their most valuable ad inventory programmatically. By connecting both sides through our integrated platform, known as the Teads Global Media Platform, we solve the digital programmatic advertising industry’s most significant problems related to value chain fragmentation, inefficient digital advertising pricing and quality and scale of inventory. We refer to the ecosystem enabled by Teads Global Media Platform as the Curated Internet. Our platform is also capable of delivering display ads, which are the preferred advertising format for performanceoriented campaigns, as well as other web and app formats. We offer advertisers and their agencies access to highquality inventory at scale. Quality inventory, especially video inventory, is in short supply in digital advertising so our Curated Internet solves a major problem for leading customers.

Within our GSM offering, we provide services in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz band spectrums. Following a multiband auction for LTE technology spectrum, ANACOM formally allocated to us rights to the 2 × 10 MHz in the 800 MHz band, 2 × 20 MHz in the 1800 MHz band and 2 × 20 MHz in the 2.6 GHz band, each for 15 years. These rights are reflected in a license that includes and supersedes our previous GSM and UMTS licenses and which imposes certain requirements on us, including MVNO, national roaming and coverage obligations with respect to our 800 MHz spectrum. The backhaul for our 2G, 3G and 4G networks is provided through IP technology. Overall, approximately 97% of the sites are served by fiber optic as of March 31, 2021, and 3% of sites are using Microwave solutions. Our 2G, 3G and 4G networks cover approximately 99.8%, 96.6% and 99.6% of the population, respectively, as of March 31, 2021. Currently, our mobile network supports the following radio capacities: 2G/GSM: EDGE (240 Kbps); 3G/UMTS: HSPA+ Carrier Aggregation (42 Mbps); and 4G/LTE: Carrier Aggregation (900 Mbps). Since 2019 we have carried out the technological renewal of mobile voice and packet data solutions, in a virtualized environment to allow greater agility and scalability, also guaranteeing the ability to provide new services such as VoLTE. Through roaming agreements, our subscribers can make and receive mobile calls throughout Europe and in many other countries around the world. As of March 31, 2021, we have entered into roaming agreements with approximately 660 operators in 220 countries. On October 22, 2019, ANACOM approved a draft decision on the designation of the 700 MHz band for electronic communications services, limiting the number of rights of use of frequencies to be allocated in the 700 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2.1 GHz bands, 2.6 GHz and 3.6 GHz, subject to an auction procedure. On December 23, 2019, ANACOM approved the decision on the designation of the 700 MHz band for terrestrial electronic communications services, caps on the number of rights of use of frequencies to be allocated in the 700 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2.1 GHz, 2.6 GHz and 3.6 GHz bands, as well as the definition of the respective allocation procedure. Under the terms of that decision, ANACOM concluded that a competitive selection process, in this case an auction, appeared to be most appropriate for selecting the entities to which the corresponding rights of use of frequencies may be allocated. At the same time, by decision of October 31, 2019, ANACOM approved the start of the procedure for preparing the Auction Regulation for the allocation of rights of use of frequencies in the aforementioned bands. The Auction Regulation was approved in October 2020. Under the terms of the Auction Regulation, PT OpCo submitted its application, which was approved. A bidding phase exclusive for new entrants started on December 22, 2020 and ended in early January 2021. The main bidding phase started on January 14, 2021 and is still in progress. This process is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2021. This complies with the EU strategy for the “Digital Single Market”, which recommended a coordinated introduction at the EU level to encourage investment in high-speed broadband networks and to facilitate the proliferation of advanced digital services, in particular by highlighting the need to ensure the provision of broadband services in rural areas. Following the completion of the Portuguese Towers Transaction, PT OpCo entered into a 20-year agreement with OMTEL for the use of the above-mentioned 2,961 sites and the other sites to be built, for a monthly fee dependent ----- on the type and location of each site.

As of March 31, 2021, our mobile network provides 4G coverage to 99% of the population of Israel. Our GSM/UMTS/LTE/5G network is operated and maintained by PHI (as defined below) and is among the most advanced nationwide networks in Israel. When we originally launched our mobile services in Israel in May 2012, we had relied on Pelephone’s network to provide in-country roaming services to our customers in areas not covered by our UMTS network. On July 2, 2014, the Israeli Ministry of Communications initiated a tender process for 4G-LTE frequencies comprising a total of eight frequency bands in the area of 1,800 MHz to enable delivery of mobile services using LTE technology. The process was concluded on August 9, 2015, when two frequency bands at the width of 5 MHz in the 1.8 GHz were allocated to HOT Mobile, as a result of which HOT Mobile launched its LTE service. The Network Sharing Agreement with Partner was approved by the Israeli Antitrust Authority and the Israeli Ministry of Communications on April 20, 2015 and is valid until December 31, 2028, and provides for automatic renewals in five-year increments after December 31, 2028. Pursuant to the Network Sharing Agreement, HOT Mobile shares 15 MHz in the 1.8 GHz, providing a total capacity of 20 MHz in the 1.8 GHz area.

The terms and conditions of our contracts governing the payments and content providers of copyright fees to broadcasters vary by jurisdiction. We also enter into transportation and distribution agreements with commercial broadcasters. Through transportation contracts, we agree to carry a commercial broadcaster’s signal across our fiber backbone to our head-end stations, where the signal is subsequently delivered to our subscribers. Broadcasters who transmit their signal to us by satellite can elect to deliver their signal directly to our head-end stations and, as a result, do not need to enter into a transportation agreement with us. We also enter into distribution arrangements with all of the commercial broadcasters whose channels we carry on our networks, pursuant to which we agree to carry the broadcaster’s signal from the head-end station to our cable television subscribers. A variety of compensation arrangements have been made in respect of the contracts we enter into with the commercial broadcasters. In some situations, we do not charge the broadcasters any fee for transmitting their signal to our subscribers. Instead, the broadcasters benefit from increased advertising revenue they receive from reaching our basic cable television subscribers and we benefit by providing our subscribers added content. In certain situations, we pay broadcasters for the channels they transmit over our network. In other instances, we have entered into revenue-sharing arrangements or subscriber-based fixed fees.

We believe that this has allowed us to realize significant cost savings. However, while we progress the globalization of our procurement functions, our businesses continue to purchase certain products and services under locally negotiated contracts, for example, due to the need for geography-specific products and services. We have relationships with a number of suppliers across our geographies that provide us with hardware, software and various other products and services necessary to operate our businesses. In the Dominican Republic we have a strategy of supplier diversification in a number of different areas, thus mitigating the potential impact in terms of deliveries and eventual price effects. In Portugal and Israel, we have been constantly monitoring the market evolution and introducing supply chain adaptations to better deal with such scenarios. Our proactive approach has driven us to implement several actions during last year in order to significantly increase our supply chain resilience to deal with such situations without major disruptions. These improvements have been permanently under adaptations as the situation evolves, and some of these improvements are as follows: - collaborative planning with vendors, providing better long term visibility with wider forecasting horizons; - anticipation of purchase orders, according to revised lead times, while keeping stock levels under control; - revision of CPE commercial rules, adapting the demand to the availability on each CPE type, while fulfilling the overall market needs; - temporary reduction of capillarity on the maintenance distribution channels, still ensuring proper S&M levels while reducing stock dispersion and keeping the necessary availability to fully sustain out commercial performance; and - reinforcement of used equipment retrieval and corresponding refurbishment. We are also constantly revising our whole supply chain in order to anticipate shortage risks or transportation delays. We use a limited number of subcontractors to maintain our network, operate our call centers and supply, install and maintain installed consumer and on-site business and public sector terminals, with the Group’s employees performing only a small portion of installations.

For a subscriber located on one telephony network to complete a telephone call to an end-user served by another telephony network, the subscriber’s network service provider must interconnect either to the end-user’s network, or to the network that transfers the call to the end-user’s network. Typically, the network transferring the call and the end-user’s network charge the subscriber’s service provider a fee to transfer or to terminate the communication. Interconnection fees are typically regulated by the telecommunications regulator in each of the countries in which we operate. Regulators also commonly impose on all participants in the fixed-line telephony and mobile telephony markets an obligation to negotiate in good faith interconnection agreements with every requesting operator who is seeking ----- to provide a publicly available electronic communication service. Generally, the cost of interconnection fees that we pay is taken into account in the price we charge our subscribers. We have entered into various domestic and international reciprocal interconnection agreements for our fixed-line telephony, mobile operations and ILD services with other providers of electronic communications services. Our interconnection agreements generally have terms that continue for the duration of the parties’ licenses to pursue telecommunication activities and may be terminated in the event of a material breach or the commencement of liquidation or insolvency proceedings. _Agreements relating to mobile roaming services_ Currently, we receive roaming services around the world from various network operators.

Accordingly, PT Portugal pays its competitors a portion of the distribution and broadcasting rights based on PT Portugal’s market share, and is entitled to recharge other operators the cost of its own exclusive broadcasting rights based on the market share of such operators. _Distribution agreement with SPORT TV_ In July 2016, PT OpCo entered into a distribution agreement with the Portuguese sports premium channel SPORT TV for a two-season period, pursuant to which PT Portugal committed to pay a non-contingent fixed price plus an additional variable fee component based on the number of subscribers and penetration rate. PT OpCo’s subsequent acquisition of a 25% stake in SPORT TV, as described under “—Significant Investments and _Dispositions”, did not affect the parties’ respective rights and obligations under this agreement. In July 2018, PT_ OpCo entered into a new distribution agreement with SPORT TV for a two-season period, the terms of which follow a similar methodology as the previous agreement. In July 2020, PT OpCo entered into a new distribution agreement with SPORT TV for a four-season period, pursuant to which PT Portugal committed to pay a noncontingent fixed price plus an additional variable fee component based on the number of subscribers and penetration rate. Also in July 2020, PT OpCo entered into an agreement for the sale of a portion of the broadcasting rights acquired at the end of 2015 and the beginning 2016 relating to the football clubs F.C. Porto, Vitoria F.C., Rio Ave F.C. and Boavista F.C., for a four-season period. _Contracts with football clubs_ At the end of 2015 and in the beginning of 2016, PT Portugal had entered into contracts with several first and second division football clubs in Portugal, including F.C. Porto, Vitoria F.C., Rio Ave F.C. and Boavista F.C., and three second division clubs. Under these contracts, we (i) acquired the exclusive broadcasting rights for the home games of these clubs for up to ten football seasons for certain clubs, (ii) acquired the broadcasting rights of “Porto Canal” (F.C. Porto’s own TV channel) for a period of twelve and a half years from January 2016 onwards and (iii) entered into sponsorship agreements for periods of up to ten football seasons. The total value of these contracts amounts to €620 million (excluding VAT). The amounts payable under these contracts may change depending on the rank of the teams at the end of the season, particularly in case of promotion or relegation. Existing key agreements include: (i) The agreements entered into with F.C. Porto, F.C. Porto-Futebol SAD and FCP Media, under which we (i) acquired the broadcasting rights of the games of these clubs for ten seasons (2018/2019 to 2027/2028), (ii) acquired the broadcasting rights of the Porto Canal for a period of twelve and a half years (January ----- 2016 to June 2028) and (iii) obtained sponsorship rights for seven and a half seasons (January 2016 to June 2023). (ii) The agreement entered into with Vitoria Sport Clube-Futebol SAD under which we (a) acquired the broadcasting rights of the games of these clubs for ten seasons (2018/2019 to 2027/2028) and (b) obtained sponsorship rights for ten seasons (2018/2019 to 2027/2028).

(iv) The agreement entered into with Boavista F.C.-Futebol SAD, under which we acquired broadcasting rights for the games of this club for ten seasons (2016/2017 to 2025/2026). _Fiber Sharing Agreement with Vodafone Portugal_ In July 2014, we signed an agreement with Vodafone Portugal to deploy, swap capacity and share fiber networks beginning in December 2014, for an initial term of 25 years. The initial term automatically renews for four year increments unless a party provides written objection to a renewal two years in advance of the termination date. The agreement includes sharing of dark fiber in approximately 900,000 homes, where each party grants to the other party an exclusive IRU for certain PON network cells it owns (totaling approximately 450,000 homes each). Since the model is based on a swap of capacity through IRUs, the title to the PON network cells remains with the granting party, which allows both parties to maintain full autonomy and flexibility in designing retail offers, including the provision of RF (analog) TV signal, and will ensure confidentiality of customer information. During the first ten years of the agreement, there is an undertaking of partnership between the parties for the construction of new PON network cells. A party must notify the other party if it wishes to build new PON network cells in any geographical area which does not correspond to the PON network cells already covered by the agreement. If the other party is also willing to build new PON network cells, both parties must then commit to the construction of new PON network cells in partnership with each other. This undertaking from each party does not apply after the first ten years of the agreement, nor when a party decides to build PON network cells in partnership with another operator (provided that such PON network cells are not covered by the agreement). Additionally, each party may transfer the entirety (but not part) of its PON network cells covered by the agreement to a third-party purchaser, provided that such purchaser also assumes the obligations of the selling party under the agreement. The non-selling party has a pre-emption right where the third party purchaser is a retail operator in the broadband market, which is not in the same “economic group” as the seller. If the selling-party does not comply with the conditions to transfer and the pre-emption right, it will be subject to a penalty. In the event of a material and/or continuous default of one party, the other party may unilaterally terminate the agreement by exercising a call option. Pursuant to the Altice Portugal FTTH Transaction, this agreement has been transferred to FastFiber. _Agreement to Dispose of Portuguese Tower Assets_ On July 18, 2018, PT Portugal reached an agreement with a consortium including Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and Horizon Equity Partners for the sale of a 75% stake in the newly incorporated tower company called OMTEL, comprising PT OpCo’s mobile telecommunications passive infrastructure corresponding to 2,961 sites previously operated by PT OpCo. The transaction valued this tower business at an enterprise value of €660 million. The purchase price of €648 million included a cash consideration for the disposal of the 75% stake in the amount of €540 million and the acquisition of a 25% stake in OMTEL by PT Portugal measured at a fair value of €108 million. The agreement with the consortium includes an additional deferred payment based on an earn-out structure upon exit by the consortium. In connection with this transaction, PT OpCo entered into a 20-year agreement with OMTEL for the use of the above-mentioned 2,961 sites and the other sites to be built, for a monthly fee dependent on the type and location of each site. In addition, a build-to-suit agreement for 400 new sites was signed between PT OpCo and OMTEL. ----- On January 2, 2020, PT Portugal sold its 25% equity interest in OMTEL to Cellnex Telecom SA for total cash proceeds of approximately €200 million, as part of a larger transaction pursuant to which Cellnex acquired 100% of the share capital of OMTEL.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

In April 2020, we carved-out the fiber business into a dedicated wholesale vehicle FastFiber. On April 17, 2020, we disposed of a 49.99% interest in FastFiber to Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners for cash consideration of €1,576 million received at closing, with additional €375 million to be received in December 2021 and, subject to certain performance ratchets, a further €375 million to be received in December 2026. The shareholders’ agreement provides for, among other things, a board of directors, which comprises of five members, with three directors appointed by PT Portugal and two directors appointed by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners, subject to change based on the parties’ percentage of ownership interests in FastFiber. The shareholders’ agreement also establishes customary minority protective rights and provides that certain specified decisions are not permitted to be made without the consent of at least one director appointed by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners or the consent of Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners in the shareholders’ general meeting, as applicable, subject to certain conditions including a minimum ownership percentage by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners.

Satellite Services (1998) Ltd, an associate of Bezeq which provides satellite technology based multichannel television services under the “YES” brand. In exchange, the State of Israel agreed to waive all of its claims and rights concerning cable infrastructure, such that our predecessor companies would hold all rights and title to the cable infrastructure in their respective concession areas and have the right to operate the cable network even after the end of the concession periods. The agreement, which was transferred to the Group as part of the Israeli cable consolidation process, sets out a payment mechanism based on revenues deriving from the use of the cable infrastructure pursuant to which we were required to make annual payments to the State of Israel until January 1, 2015. As of 2015, we are no longer obligated to pay such annual payments. However, we are required to pay certain amounts to the State of Israel, as provided in the agreement, in the event we sell any of our cable network assets or operations carried out via the cable infrastructure or in the event we issue securities through a public offering, investment or similar transaction. _Agreements with Bezeq relating to installation and maintenance of portions of our cable network_ In the 1990s, certain of our predecessor companies entered into agreements with Bezeq for the purpose of planning, installing and maintaining the cable networks pursuant to which they intended to provide cable television services. The cable networks and the related agreements with Bezeq were transferred to the Group as part of the Israeli cable consolidation process. The agreements are valid until we have valid broadcasting licenses. Under the terms of the agreements, Bezeq is required to maintain the portion of our cable network that passes through its ducts on an on-going basis and is also responsible for repairing breakdowns in the network. The scope of the agreements extends to the possibility of expanding the cable network to additional sites, connecting new homes and connecting new neighborhoods. Bezeq is permitted to terminate the agreements if we breach the agreements and have not cured such breach within six months of written notice from Bezeq. The agreements set ----- forth a payment mechanism pursuant to which we pay Bezeq an annual amount representing capital expenditure and maintenance costs based on the length of the cable network passing through its ducts as well as one-time payments in respect of certain services provided by Bezeq. Capital expenditure costs are staggered over a 12-year period and the amounts payable to Bezeq are accordingly reduced by approximately 65% after 12 years of the delivery of each segment of the cable network. In July 2020, we entered into a new agreement with Bezeq, replacing the previous agreement. According to the new agreement, HOT will continue to use Bezeq’s infrastructure but the maintenance of the network in such areas as well as the establishment of new network segments will be carried by HOT. We incurred total costs of NIS 50 million, NIS 51 million and NIS 49 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively, for services provided by Bezeq under these agreements. _Agreement with IBC Israel_ On September 15, 2020, HOT announced the acquisition of a stake in IBC Israel. The transaction closed on February 11, 2021 following regulatory and third-party approvals. Following the closing of the acquisition, HOT became an equal partner in the IBC Partnership, an entity that holds 70% of IBC Israel’s share capital, together with Cellcom and Israel Infrastructure Fund. HOT indirectly holds 23.3% of IBC Israel’s share capital, through an investment of €45 million, substantially equal to the investment made by each of Cellcom and Israel Infrastructure Fund. IEC, Israel’s Electricity Corporation, holds 30% shares of IBC Israel. As an integral part of the investment transaction, HOT entered into an agreement for the purchase of indefeasible rights of use (IRU) in infrastructure lines in IBC Israel, according to certain committed percentage increasing gradually, of the customers houses connected to IBC Israel’s network. In addition, the parties signed an agreement for the provision of fiber optic deployment services, maintenance and other technical services by a corporation held by HOT to IBC Israel. _Agreement with Nokia Solutions and Networks relating to installation of the UMTS/LTE network_ In June 2011, we entered into an agreement with Nokia Solutions and Networks (“NSN”) for the establishment of the new UMTS network infrastructure pursuant to which we provide 3G mobile services to our customers. Under the terms of the agreement, NSN has agreed to plan and erect the new network infrastructure on a turnkey basis. NSN has also agreed to provide maintenance with respect to our mobile network. In the first stage, completed in 2012, NSN satisfied its requirement to complete the network with coverage extending to 20% of the Israeli population according to our mobile license requirements. During 2013 and 2014, several amendments were made to the agreement with NSN postponing payments due under the agreement in return for an obligation which was issued in favor of NSN and guaranteed by HOT. In this framework of agreements HOT Mobile also confirmed receipt of a final instalment of key parts in relation to the aforementioned project. In July 2014, an agreement was signed between HOT Mobile and NSN for the provision of equipment, hardware and software. In addition, HOT Mobile acquired the construction and integration services of the LTE core network for purposes of providing domestic roaming services and for adapting its network pursuant to the requirements of the Network Sharing Agreement with Partner. In July 2016, an amendment was made to the agreement regarding purchase of additional equipment and software as well as maintenance services for the core of the network for the years 2016 and 2017. In December 2019 and August 2020, HOT Mobile signed an extension to the Nokia agreement, for the year 2019 and 2020, respectively, and is currently negotiating with NSN for an extension for 2021. _Mobile Network Sharing Agreement with Partner in Israel_ On November 8, 2013, HOT Mobile entered into a network sharing agreement (the “Network Sharing",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Each party is required to maintain and operate its own core network and independently provide mobile communication services, including marketing and sales of such services, to its respective customer base. On April 20, 2015, the Israeli Antitrust Authority and the Israeli Ministry of Communications provided regulatory approval for the Network Sharing Agreement subject to certain conditions including, among others, the prevention of the transmission of business information and technology (which does not require joint activity), and conditions relating to the management of PHI. The decision further stipulated that each party shall be entitled at all times, and at its sole discretion, to call a third party for provision of mobile communication services which are used in ----- the core network of such party, and that PHI will not be a party to the agreement and shall not be entitled to payments made thereunder. However, from May 22, 2021 the Commissioner may revoke such regulatory approval if the Commissioner finds the partnership, its existence or its actions harm competition. As of the date hereof, such regulatory approval is still in place. On August 9, 2015, PHI received its license to render Radio Cellular Infrastructure services for a period of 10 years. The Network Sharing Agreement, among other things, regulates the management and development of the shared network and the management and governance of PHI (including a mechanism for appointing directors, the approval of business plans and certain decisions that require the approval of both parties). As consideration, HOT Mobile was required to pay Partner an initial amount and, thereafter, each party bears half of the capital expenditures required to establish and upgrade the shared network. The shared network operational expenditures are allocated in accordance with a prescribed mechanism based on, inter alia, the traffic volume usage of each party. HOT has provided a guarantee with respect to HOT Mobile’s obligations under the Network Sharing Agreement and the Group may be required to provide an additional guarantee or a bank guarantee to Partner in the event that the Group’s corporate rating is downgraded below a specified level. The Network Sharing Agreement with Partner is valid until December 31, 2028 and provides for automatic renewals in five-year increments after December 31, 2028. However, at any time after the eighth anniversary of the effective date of the Network Sharing Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement by providing 24 months’ prior notice. The Network Sharing Agreement may also be terminated by a non-defaulting party upon certain specified events, including a material breach, failure of a party to meet its funding obligations, termination of a party’s license by the Israeli Ministry of Communications and the occurrence of certain insolvency events. The Network Sharing Agreement also provides for an exit plan upon termination. In January 2019, HOT Mobile and Partner signed an amendment to the Network Sharing Agreement with respect to the governance of PHI, effective on January 1, 2019. Following this amendment, the parties have joint control over PHI (compared to significant influence before the amendment); accordingly, PHI is accounted under the provisions of IFRS 11 (Joint _Arrangements) as joint operation (recognition of HOT Mobile’s interests in PHI’s assets, liabilities, revenues and_ expenses) instead of equity method.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Further, we are generally required to provide severance pay upon the retirement, death or dismissal of an employee. We are also required to make national insurance payments on behalf of our employees to the government in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Some of our employees in certain countries in which we operate belong to organized unions and works councils. In certain jurisdictions, our operating companies are also subject to collective bargaining agreements with trade unions (for example, Portugal and Israel). In certain jurisdictions we have, in the past, faced several strikes by personnel as a result of headcount optimization or changes in our workforce. Some of these strikes disrupted our business and attracted adverse publicity. In Israel, since July 2014, HOT recognizes the New General Histadrut of Workers as an organization representing the workers of HOT and HOT Telecom. On February 10, 2016, HOT signed collective agreements with the workers union and the New General Histadrut of Workers for a three year period, pursuant to which, among other things, the following items were agreed: (i) salary increases of up to 16% on average during the period of the agreement, including one-time increases of up to 10% for persons having a monthly salary less than NIS 9,000 and who have been employed for more than three years with HOT; (ii) a variety of miscellaneous benefits, such as protection against dismissal and giving preference to internal workers for promotions and appointments to managerial positions; and (iii) support for workers and their families, such as additional salaries to finance childcare, summer camps and health insurance. Subsequently, on October 31, 2016 a new collective agreement was signed between HOT Mobile, the HOT Mobile workers’ committee and the New Workers’ Histadrut, as the representative organization for HOT Mobile, the key points of which are as follows: (i) the agreement became effective on October 31, 2016 and had a three-year term; (ii) the employees (as defined in the agreement) were entitled to salary increases averaging up to 1.5% in the first two years of the agreement, with the salary increase in the third year of the agreement being negotiable; and (iii) the employees were entitled to receive a variety of benefits, including: (a) increased employee welfare budgets and signing bonuses; (b) employment security, such as arranging for a termination protection mechanism and arranging for placement while giving preference to internal workers; and (c) employee support, such as salary increases to finance summer schools, health insurance ----- and an increased holiday bonus.

For more information regarding our employee benefit obligations, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Defined Benefit and _Defined Contribution Pension Plans” and the Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering_ Memorandum. In Portugal, we are liable for certain post-retirement benefits, including pension supplements, healthcare benefits and remuneration of employees under suspension and pre-retirement agreements (which remuneration is paid on a monthly basis until such suspended/pre-retired employees reach the statutory retirement age). Under several defined benefit plans, PT OpCo is responsible for paying pension supplements to a group of employees. In order to finance these pension supplement obligations, PT OpCo incorporated various funds which are supervised by the Portuguese Insurance and Pension Funds Supervisory Authority and are not fully capitalized. Additionally, under a defined benefit plan, PT OpCo is responsible for paying healthcare expenses to a group of employees (covering 19,800 beneficiaries as of December 31, 2020, approximately 18% of which are still in service) and their relatives (covering 7,075 beneficiaries as of December 31, 2020). In 2004, PT Portugal established PT Prestações—Mandatária de Aquisições e Gestão de Bens, S.A., an autonomous fund to finance these obligations, which is managed by a subsidiary of PT Portugal. These obligations are not subject to any legal funding requirements and the autonomous fund is not supervised by the Portuguese Insurance and Pension Funds Supervisory Authority. In Israel, our employee benefit plans are normally financed by contributions to insurance companies and classified as defined contribution plans or as defined benefit plans. We have defined contribution plans under which we pay regular contributions and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient amounts to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. In addition, we have a defined benefit plan in respect of severance pay pursuant to the Severance Pay Law, 5723-1963, according to which employees are entitled to receive severance pay upon dismissal or retirement. In respect of our severance pay obligations to certain employees, we make current deposits in pension funds and insurance companies.

Significant litigation involving the PT Portugal Group is further described below. _Tax proceedings_ We estimate that the cumulative balance of probable tax contingencies arising from tax audits conducted by Portuguese tax authorities on various companies within the PT Portugal Group amount to €58 million as of March 31, 2021. The provision covers risks related mainly to the deductibility of capital losses on the disposal of financial investments and VAT on indemnities charged as result of the breach of loyalty contracts, entered into with postpaid customers. The VAT contingency relates to both the fixed and mobile businesses and covers years since 2012. The assessment for the VAT of the mobile business in 2012 has been submitted to an arbitral tribunal, which decided to refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the EU (“CJEU”) for a preliminary ruling. On November 22, 2018, the CJEU issued a decision which was unfavorable to PT OpCo, concluding that, under certain circumstances, indemnities should be charged with VAT, and at the same time concluding that ultimately VAT should only be assessed based on indemnities received from customers. The tax assessments of the fixed-line business in 2012 and both the mobile and fixed-line businesses in 2013 and 2014, were submitted to the arbitral tribunal as well, and all proceedings were suspended pending the decision of the CJEU. Following the CJEU’s decision, PT OpCo was notified of the arbitral tribunal’s decisions, all unfavorable, although concluding that VAT should only be assessed based on indemnities received from customers, which is less than 20% of the overall indemnities invoiced. For all the processes against the arbitral court decisions PT OpCo presented appeals to the TCA (Central Administrative Court). For the year 2015, the contingency was annulled following the voluntary tax payment made by PT OpCo under that year’s tax inspection. A similar approach was followed in relation to the years 2016, 2017 and 2018. For the following years it is not certain that tax authorities will accept a similar adjustment. In addition, we have received certain tax assessments from the tax authorities questioning the deductibility of certain interest expenses incurred between 2005 and 2010 for income tax purposes (€236 million as of March 31, 2021). We strongly disagree with these assessments and believe, based on the opinion of our tax advisors, that there are solid arguments to oppose the position of the tax authorities. We do not consider the losses related to these tax contingencies to be probable. Further, PT OpCo has received a preliminary tax inspection report for the year 2018 in which the tax authorities are proposed a stamp tax correction of €29 million relating to the Portuguese Towers Transaction. PT OpCo submitted its preliminary defense on May 24, 2021, but the tax authorities maintained their position in their final tax inspection report. MEO is now required to pay or present a guarantee by the end of August 2021 and it has until the end of the year to present an administrative claim. PT OpCo intends to counter the possible correction. As of March 31, 2021, the amount of provision recorded in the Unaudited Financial Statements in relation to this tax inspection is €0 (nil). _Regulatory and Civil Proceedings Optimus—Interconnection agreement_ In 2001, Optimus—Comunicações S.A. (now “NOS”) brought an action against Telecomunicações Móveis Nacionais (“TMN”) relating to prices charged by TMN to NOS for mobile interconnection services. TMN transferred the receivables from NOS to PTC (PT Portugal’s fixed operation at the time, now PT OpCo) and subsequently PT OpCo offset those receivables with payables due to NOS. NOS argued for the annulment of the ----- offset amount and claimed the amount of payables originally due to NOS plus accrued interest. In August 2015, the court decided that the transfer of the interconnection receivables from TMN to PT OpCo, and consequently the offset of such receivables, was invalid. The court therefore ruled against PT OpCo, ordering the payment of approximately €35 million in payables and interest. PT OpCo appealed to the Court of Appeal in October 2015. In September 2016, PT OpCo was notified of the decision from the Court of Appeal which confirmed the initial ruling against PT OpCo, as a result of which PT OpCo decided to appeal to the Supreme Court. On March 13, 2017, PT OpCo was notified of the Supreme Court’s decision of dismissal of its appeal, following which it appealed to the Constitutional Court. On January 8, 2018, the Constitutional Court notified PT OpCo that it had dismissed the appeal. PT OpCo subsequently appealed to the Constitutional Court Conference which decided not to accept the appeal. In July 2018, PT OpCo paid €41 million to NOS as a result of these proceedings. NOS claimed an additional amount of interest during the judicial procedure and is now claiming an additional payment of €5 million. The legal action by PT OpCo was submitted in February 2019. On May 8, 2020, PT OpCo received the first instance sentence that absolves PT OpCo of the request by NOS. NOS appealed to the higher court that, on January 15, 2021, ordered PT OpCo to pay the total amount requested by NOS. PT OpCo appealed to the Supreme Court in February 2021. _ANACOM litigation_ PT OpCo is subject to several outstanding proceedings filed by ANACOM, although PT OpCo has not yet received formal notifications for some of these proceedings. The proceedings include matters such as the violation of rules relating to portability, DTT, the non-compliance of obligations under the universal service obligations (fixed voice and public phones) and restricting the access to phone numbers starting at 760. Historically, PT OpCo paid amounts significantly lower than the administrative fines set by ANACOM in final decisions. The initial value of the proceedings is normally set at the maximum applicable amount of the administrative fine until the final decision is formally issued. We are regularly involved in regulatory inquiries and investigations involving our operations, including by ANACOM, regarding our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to _Legislative and Regulatory Matters—We are subject to significant government regulation and supervision, which could require us to make additional expenditures or limit our revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business, and further regulatory changes could also adversely affect our business” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters—We can only operate our business for as long as we have licenses from the relevant authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and we may not be able to obtain, retain or review the licenses and authorizations necessary for conducting our activities”._ As of March 31, 2021, we had ongoing administrative proceedings initiated by ANACOM in an aggregate amount of approximately €37 million (though the maximum possible fine for an individual proceeding is capped at €5 million). We believe that most of the complaints that have resulted in such investigations should be dismissed due to the nature of the alleged abuses. However, if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations in these or other regulatory inquiries and investigations, we could become subject to penalties, fines, damages or other sanctions. _Zon TV Cabo Portugal—Violation of portability rules_ In 2011, NOS (known as Zon TV Cabo Portugal at the time of the proceeding) initiated legal proceedings against PT OpCo, claiming that the latter had not complied with the rules applicable to the portability of fixed numbers. NOS is seeking €22 million in damages corresponding to profits allegedly lost due to unreasonable rejections by PT OpCo and the delay in providing the portability of numbers. An expert appointed by each party as well as a third party expert evaluated this matter and presented a final report to the court in January 2019 and the final court hearing is scheduled for October 2021. _Municipal taxes and rights-of-way_ Pursuant to a statute enacted on August 1, 1997, as an operator of a basic telecommunications network, we were exempt from municipal taxes and rights-of-way and other fees with respect to our network in connection with our obligations under the concession. The Portuguese government has advised us in the past that this statute confirmed the tax exemption under our concession and that it will continue to take the necessary actions in order for us to maintain the economic benefits contemplated by the concession. ----- Law 5/2004, dated February 10, 2004, established a new rights-of-way regime in Portugal whereby each municipality may establish a fee, up to a maximum of 0.25% of each wireline services bill, to be paid by the customers of those wireline operators whose network infrastructures are located in each such municipality. Meanwhile, Decree-Law 123/2009, dated May 21, 2009, clarified that no other tax should be levied by the municipalities in addition to the tax established by Law 5/2004. This interpretation was confirmed by the Supreme Administrative Court of Portugal in several legal actions. Some municipalities, however, continue to hold the position that Law 5/2004 does not expressly revoke other taxes that the municipalities wish to establish because Law 5/2004 is not applicable to public municipalities. Currently, there are legal actions with some municipalities regarding this matter and some of the municipalities have initiated enforcement proceedings against us to demand the payment of those taxes. _Vodafone Portugal—Network Sharing Agreement_ In 2014, Vodafone Portugal and PTC (now PT OpCo) signed an agreement for the acquisition of exclusive rights of use of the PON network. The agreement contained the possibility of access to the installed infrastructure owned by each of the parties to offer new generation services and integrated offerings of voice, internet and television services autonomously in the retail market. In 2015, PT OpCo informed Vodafone Portugal that it has decided to individually develop a new plan for the expansion of its fiber optic network, both in geographical areas already covered by a new generation network and in other geographical areas, while continuing to comply with their agreement. Vodafone Portugal nonetheless states that this was a breach of the agreement and submitted a claim for damages of approximately €132 million to an arbitral tribunal. In June 2018, PT OpCo filed a defense to the claim in which it opposed Vodafone Portugal’s submissions. A preliminary hearing took place in February 2019, following which the court asked experts to review information provided by Vodafone Portugal supporting its alleged damages and losses. The experts’ reports have been submitted to the court and the deadline for both parties to comment was the end of October 2020. PT OpCo and Vodafone responded to the experts analysis, asking for clarification on some of the elements of the expertise, and the court gave the experts a period of time until the end of March 2021 to respond. The experts’ reports have been submitted to the court and the judgment sessions are scheduled to start in October 2021. _European Commission investigation into PT Portugal Acquisition_ After having approved the PT Portugal Acquisition on April 20, 2015, the EC initiated an investigation into infringement by Altice Europe of the obligation of prior notification of concentrations under Article 4(1) of the Merger Regulation and/or of the stand-still obligation laid down in Article 7(1) of the Merger Regulation. The EC issued a statement of objections on May 18, 2017 alleging that Altice Europe breached the Merger Regulation by implementing the PT Portugal Acquisition before notification or approval by the EC as required under applicable law. On August 18, 2017, Altice Europe submitted a full response to the statement of objections in which it contested all of the objections and requested that a hearing take place. A hearing took place in Brussels on September 21, 2017. On April 24, 2018, the EC notified the Altice Europe Group of its decision to impose upon it a fine of €125 million on the basis of a finding that the Altice Europe Group infringed the prior notification obligation of a concentration under Article 4(1) of the EU Merger Regulation as well as the stand-still obligation under Article 7(1) of the Merger Regulation. The Altice Europe Group disputes the EC’s decision and on July 5, 2018, the Altice Europe Group filed an appeal against the decision before the GCEU seeking annulment of the decision or, at the very least, a significant reduction in the fine imposed. On July 25, 2018, we issued a bank guarantee to the EC in relation to the fine for an amount of €125 million. The appeal proceedings before the GCEU are currently ongoing and certain details relating to the status of the matter are set out below. On November 6, 2018, the Council of the EU filed an application to intervene in the case. On November 30, 2018, the EC lodged a defense, to which Altice Europe replied on February 25, 2019, in line with the submissions set forth in its appeal. On March 15, 2019, Altice Europe filed its observations on the Statement of intervention of the Council of European Union, to which Altice Europe received the EC’s observations on March 18, 2019. The EU filed its rejoinder to Altice Europe’s reply on May 10, 2019. Altice Europe submitted a reasoned request for a hearing on May 29, 2019. On March 10, 2020, Altice Europe received from the General Court an invitation addressed to all the parties to submit observations regarding the possible consequences of the CJEU judgment on another case. On March 25, 2020, Altice Europe lodged its observations and reiterated its submission filed on May 29, 2019. On March 23, 2020, the EC and the Council of the EU lodged their observations, wherein they concluded that Altice Europe’s application should be rejected. On June 3, 2020, Altice Europe received the decision from the General Court to open the oral part of the procedure. On July 21, 2020, Altice Europe received the report for the hearing prepared by the Judge Rapporteur summarizing the facts relied on and the arguments of ----- each party and of the Council as the intervener. The hearing took place on September 24, 2020 and on October 5, 2020, Altice Europe sent a letter to the General Court with some observations to respond to a question posed by the Judge Rapporteur during the hearing. On November 16, 2020, Altice Europe received the decision from the General Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure, to hear the other parties on Altice Europe’s observations and to request the EC to produce certain documents. On December 10, 2020, Altice Europe received a copy of the EC’s and the Council’s responses. On January 7, 2021, Altice Europe sent its observations to the EC’s reply. On January 12, 2021, Altice Europe received the decision from the General Court to close the oral part of the procedure. The judgement on the matter is scheduled for September 22, 2021. As of March 31, 2021, a liability of €130 million (including accrued interest) is recorded at Altice Portugal, as it is the acquiring entity of PT Portugal. These proceedings do not affect the approval granted by the EC for the PT Portugal Acquisition. _Potential claims_ PTC is subject to a potential compensation claim brought by Estradas de Portugal relating to PTC’s use of a technical road channel between 2007 and 2014. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, no formal legal proceedings have been initiated with regards to these claims. _National Commission for Data Protection_ PT OpCo has several outstanding proceedings filed by the National Commission for Data Protection (“CNPD”), for some of which PT OpCo has not yet received formal condemnations. This includes matters such as the violation of rules relating to marketing contact with clients and alleged non-compliance of obligations under the database of debtors to telecom operators. Historically, PT OpCo paid significantly lower (or even no amounts) of the administrative fines set by CNPD in final decisions. The initial value of the proceedings is normally set at the maximum applicable amount of the administrative fine until the final decision is formally issued. The existing processes are still in progress and the new ones are being prepared for the defense phase. _Portuguese Competition Authority investigation_ On December 20, 2019, PT OpCo received a Statement of Objections from the Portuguese Competition Authority regarding its preliminary view that both PT OpCo and NOWO, which operates as an MVNO using PT OpCo’s network, were part of a cartel for market sharing and price fixing of mobile services, sold either on a standalone basis or in bundles of fixed and mobile telecommunications services. The Portuguese Competition Authority concluded that this alleged illegal practice took place between 2017 and 2018. PT OpCo firmly denies the existence of any cartel. On February 19, 2020, PT OpCo submitted its written defense to the Statement of Objections. On December 3, 2020, the Portuguese Competition Authority notified PT OpCo of its decision to impose a fine of €84 million for market sharing and price fixing of mobile and fixed telecommunications services with NOWO. On January 18, 2021, PT OpCo filed a judicial appeal against the decision before the Competition, Supervision and Regulation Court to request the decision to be annulled and to be acquitted of all charges. As of March 31, 2021, the provision recorded in relation to this matter in our financial statements is €0 (nil). _Portuguese Competition Authority investigation – Google AdWords_ On July 17, 2020, the Portuguese Competition Authority issued a Statement of Objections regarding its preliminary view that PT OpCo, NOS Comunicações, NOWO – Communications, S.A. and Vodafone Portugal – Comunicações Pessoas, S.A. were part of an agreement in accordance with which these entities would not bid for certain key Google AdWords of the other operators, which in accordance with the Portuguese Competition Authority is similar to an agreement to indirectly fix the acquisition price of certain Google AdWords related to the retail telecommunications market. The Portuguese Competition Authority concluded that telecommunications operators distorted competition of the Portuguese online search advertising, between 2010 and 2018 in the case of PT OpCo. The maximum fine applicable for this kind of infraction corresponds to 10% of the entity’s turnover. ----- PT OpCo submitted its written defense to the Statement of Objections on October 2, 2020 and is still awaiting a decision. Management determined that it cannot estimate the probability of the outcome of this case and as such no provision was recognized as of March 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

As of the date hereof, certain of the material pending class action suits filed against HOT and its subsidiaries include: (i) a suit for alleged breaches of certain subscribers’ agreements and misleading subscribers when increasing prices of services, (ii) a suit alleging discrimination by HOT between customers in relation to subscription fees, (iii) a suit alleging that HOT has not upheld its obligations to (a) establish, maintain and operate a public, nation-wide telecommunication network and (b) use the network to provide telecommunications services and multi-channel television services to public subscribers throughout the country, specifically in Arab communities, (iv) a suit alleging broadcasting of commercials on sports channels in violation of the relevant regulation, (v) a suit alleging violation by HOT and HOT Telecom of regulatory obligations regarding response time in call centers, (vi) a suit regarding sales of channels, (vii) a suit regarding electricity charges for amplifiers in apartment buildings, (ix) a suit regarding invoicing of modems; (viii) a suit regarding delays in disconnecting subscribers and (ix) a suit regarding the allegedly unlawful extension of customer contracts. As of March 31, 2021, a provision of NIS 59 million is recorded at HOT in relation to the pending class action suits. Historically, such class action litigation brought against us has either been dismissed or settled for an amount significant lower than the damages claimed. We do not believe any of these matters individually, or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operation. _Tax proceedings_ On July 4, 2019, HOT signed a compromise agreement with the Israeli Tax Authorities for an amount of €8 million (NIS 31 million) related to tax assessment for periods 2015-2016. As of March 31, 2021, there were several tax contingencies against Cool Holding and HOT for which the risk of loss is considered probable. For these contingencies, we recorded provisions amounting to €29 million (NIS 115 million) as of March 31, 2021. _VAT proceedings_ On April 29, 2021, in relation to the VAT audit conducted by the Israeli VAT Authority for the tax years 20132019, Cool Holding and Hadaros received a VAT reassessment notice for a total amount of €151 million. The VAT assessment is related to accrued interest on intercompany bonds issued by Cool Holding and Hadaros. Cool Holding and Hadaros intend to dispute the reassessments and has been provided with an extension for filing a tax appeal until October 3, 2021. As of March 31, 2021, no provision has been recorded in the Unaudited Financial Statements in relation to these VAT reassessments. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The legal proceedings initiated against us include, amongst others, the following categories of claims: claims by or on behalf of customers on various grounds such as alleged misrepresentation or breach of service or license terms or breach of telecommunication, broadcasting, consumer or health and safety regulations, intellectual property claims primarily relating to alleged copyright infringement brought by copyright collection societies, claims by suppliers and other telecommunications providers, claims by employees and claims by the regulatory bodies whose jurisdiction we are subject to in the countries in which we operate. In Israel, a majority of legal proceedings against us are suits seeking certification as class action suits. The Israeli Class Action Law that was enacted in 2006 significantly expanded the grounds for certification of class action suits as well as the persons entitled to submit a class action suit as a result of which the number of such proceedings against us has increased significantly and may continue to increase in the future. We proactively manage our litigation risks by assessing disputes where we believe the claimant may have merit and attempting to settle such disputes on favorable terms, including in the case of suits seeking certification as class action suits at a stage prior to such certification, and contesting others where we believe the claim does not have merit. We record a provision when there is a sufficient probability that a dispute will result in a loss for the Group and the amount of such a loss can be reasonably estimated. Other than as discussed below, as of the date hereof, we are not aware of any administrative, judicial or arbitral proceedings (including any pending or threatened proceedings) that are likely to have, or have had, over the course of the last twelve months a material ----- adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The outcome of legal proceedings, however, can be extremely difficult to predict with certainty, and we can offer no assurances in this regard. We have recorded provisions for claims, legal actions and tax contingencies in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic amounting to €101 million, €44 million and €5 million, respectively, in each case as of March 31, 2021, to cover the Group’s probable future cash outflows relating to such matters.

This initial regulatory package divided the industry into two main areas: (i) a state owned and monopolistic basic telecommunications network and services, which meant the fixed national telephony services and some associated facilities, run by the publicly owned companies that in 1995 merged to form the PT Group; and (ii) the so called complementary services which assembled a large group of mainly private operators ranging from mobile wireless operators (using GSM), paging, trunking, VSAT and data transmission (using mainly Frame Relay and X25 protocols). Following the 1996 revision of the EU’s ONP Directives (e.g. Directives 96/2/EC, 96/19/EC and 97/13/EC), in August 1997, the Portuguese government decided to revise the whole regulatory structure and submitted to Parliament a new Telecommunications Bill aimed at establishing “the general bases that regulate the establishment, management and operation of telecommunications networks and the provision of telecommunications services” later enacted as Law 91/97 of August 28, 1997. The adoption of a “full liberalization” principle accelerated the progressive opening of the Portuguese telecommunications market to new entrants, and was completed on January 1, 2000, with the end of Portugal Telecom’s legal monopoly over fixed-telephony services.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The new legislation transposed the EU Review 99 package Directives and regulations to national law and revoked all previous regulations containing provisions related to general market framework, licensing, interconnection and all telecommunications networks and service provision, with the exception of radio communications, telecommunications infrastructure and supply of electronic equipment. In 2011, Law 51/2011 of September 13, 2011, amended the 2004 Communications Law, transposing other EU Directives into national law. The 2004 Communications Law was further amended several other times, including (among other statutory instruments) by Law 10/2013, of January 28, 2013, and Law 15/2016, of June 17, 2016, which introduced additional consumer protection rules. The last amendment occurred in 2020 with the enactment of Decree-Law 49/2020, of August 4, 2020. Although some provisions of the 2004 Communications Law already dealt with data privacy issues, the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC) was transposed by Law 41/2004 of August 18, 2004, which was further amended by Law 46/2012, of August 29, 2012.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The Directorate General for Competition of the EC, is responsible for assessing, investigating and sanctioning potential conducts in breach of the key provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”) relating to competition in the EU (in result of third party complaints, _ex officio investigations or, if applicable, leniency requests). Among other things, the TFEU prohibits (i) agreements or coordinated action ----- between competitors that may affect trade between the EU Member States and have as their objective or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the EU and (ii) any abuse of dominant position in certain markets within the EU that may affect trade between the EU Member States. The Directorate General for Competition enforces these rules in cooperation with national competition authorities. In addition, national courts have jurisdiction over violations of EU competition law. The Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content & Technology (DG Connect) of the EC is responsible for, among others, coordinating the regulatory framework for competition and growth over the entire range of issues in the telecommunications field: economic analysis, impact assessment, policy development and regulatory compliance. The EC can impose the termination of certain conducts, impose structural measures, if applicable, as well as impose fines not exceeding 10% of the turnover, in the last financial year, of the undertaking in breach. - On December 20, 2018, Directive 2018/1972, of the European Parliament and of the Council, of December 11, 2018 formally adopted the European Electronic Communications Code (“EECC”). The EECC is expected to have an impact over both the activities of telecommunications networks and services providers as well as the national regulators in the EU Member States. Pursuant to Article 33 of EECC, the EC shall be afforded with certain veto powers over the decisions of national regulators, such as ANACOM, regarding imposition of remedies to operators found to have significant market power. Portugal had until December 2020 to transpose the EECC to domestic legislation. - _ANACOM. ANACOM (The Autoridade Nacional de Comunicações), the Portuguese telecommunications regulator advises the Portuguese government on telecommunications policy and legislation and monitors compliance with concessions, licenses and permits granted to telecommunications networks and services providers in Portugal. The Portuguese government has substantially increased the autonomy of ANACOM and has allowed it to become a more effective and independent regulatory body. ANACOM acts on complaints against us by our competitors, our customers and other interested parties. It can impose fines on us if we do not meet our obligations under the law or its determinations. ANACOM’s decisions are subject to judicial review. The current version of the bylaws of ANACOM was approved by Decree Law 39/2015 of March 16, 2015. - _Portuguese Competition Authority. Our activities are also overseen by the Portuguese Competition Authority (Autoridade da Concorrência), which is responsible for the public enforcement of competition law in Portugal, derived from ex officio investigations, complaints by third parties and, when applicable, leniency requests. The relevant Portuguese provisions, Articles 9 and 11 of the Portuguese Competition Act, Law 19/2012, of May 8, mirror, respectively, Articles 101 and 102 of TFEU. The Portuguese Competition Authority is also competent to assess potential breaches of the TFEU’s competition rules. The Portuguese Competition Authority can impose the termination of certain conducts, impose structural measures, if applicable, as well as impose fines not exceeding 10% of the turnover, in the last financial year, of the undertaking in breach. Under Portuguese law, we are permitted to appeal any adverse decision of the Portuguese Competition Authority. The Portuguese Competition Authority’s decisions are subject to judicial review by the Competition Court, which also has jurisdiction over private enforcement action brought by private parties harmed by a potential competition law infringement. - _ERC.

1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,295,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE GROUP,295.190,Portugal,295.190.5,EU Regulatory Framework and Relevant Markets,"The EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services consists of five directives governing procedures, authorizations, access, universal service and data protection; a recommendation on relevant product and service markets within the electronic communications sector subject to “ex ante” regulation under a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services; and two regulations, one concerning the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC), the other concerning the so-called “TSM—Telecom Single Market” (which encompasses roaming on public mobile communications networks, net neutrality and international calls and SMS in the EU). EU directives, regulations and recommendations, which adopt competition law principles such as market dominance for the designation of significant market power and the definitions of relevant product and geographic markets, which may be subject to “ex ante” regulation, have involved constant changes and refinements to this framework. The framework focuses on issues such as reinforcing consumer rights, encouraging competitive conditions among operators to increase consumer choice, promoting investment in new communications infrastructure (such as by freeing spectrum for the provision of broadband services) and ensuring network security and integrity. Directive (EU) 2018/1972, of the European Parliament and of the Council approved the EECC. The deadline for the transposition of this directive into national law was December 21, 2020. Directives 2002/19/EC, 2002/20/EC, 2002/21/EC and 2002/22/EC (part of the current EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services) were repealed with effect as of December 21, 2020. As of the date hereof, Portugal has not yet transposed Directive (EU) 2018/1972 into national law. Under the current regulatory framework, national regulators may impose ex-ante obligations on operators found to have significant market power in any of the five wholesale markets identified by the EC. When considering that any of the abovementioned markets is not susceptible to ex-ante regulation in the specific national circumstances, national regulatory authorities should demonstrate, and the EC will verify, that at least one of the following criteria is not met: (i) the presence of high and non-transitory structural, legal or regulatory barriers to entry; (ii) a market structure which does not tend towards effective competition within the relevant time horizon, having regard to the state of infrastructure-based and other competition behind the barriers to entry; and (iii) competition law alone is insufficient to adequately address the identified market failure(s). The aforementioned criteria are also relevant for the purposes of national regulatory authorities to identify markets other than the aforementioned for the purposes of determining any ex-ante regulations. This identification is subject to EC’s verification. Because we are active in all of the markets identified by the EC (and ANACOM), these regulatory measures have affected, and will affect, our businesses and operations. Within the EU framework, ANACOM has identified, in the first round of analysis initiated in 2004, 19 retail and wholesale markets in Portugal. In a process it is required to undergo periodically, ANACOM has found Portugal Telecom to have significant market power in all but one of the analyzed markets, where ANACOM determined that no operator had significant market power (wholesale transit services). These markets included: (i) retail markets—access to the public telephone network at a fixed location (residential and business), publicly available ----- local and/or national telephone services provided at a fixed location (residential and business), publicly available international telephone services provided at a fixed location (residential and business), telephone services at a fixed location using non-geographic numbers, such as toll-free numbers and leased lines; and (ii) wholesale markets—call origination on the fixed telephone network provided at a fixed location, call termination on individual public telephone networks provided at a fixed location and wholesale unbundled access to local metallic loops, wholesale leased lines (trunk segments and terminating segments) and wholesale broadband access. In its second round of analysis, ANACOM conducted a market analysis to determine the regulatory obligations to be imposed on operators that at the time had a significant market power in the provision of wholesale (physical) network infrastructure access and wholesale broadband access. With respect to Wholesale Markets 4 and 5 (for the provision of wholesale (physical) network infrastructure access and wholesale broadband access), ANACOM has segmented the broadband market geographically between “C” (competitive) areas and “NC” (non-competitive) areas. In the “NC” areas we are obligated to provide a wholesale local loop unbundling reference offer (in relation to Market 4) and to provide a wholesale broadband (bitstream) reference offer (in relation to Market 5). Market 5 was deregulated in “C” areas, and hence all obligations in this market, including the wholesale bitstream reference offer, no longer apply. Nevertheless, while our obligation to provide a bitstream reference offer (Rede ADSL PT) in “C” areas expired after a transitional period, we have decided to maintain the bitstream reference offer. See “— _Areas of Recent Regulation and Updates—Next Generation Access Networks”._ In addition to PT OpCo, all other fixed-line operators in Portugal were determined to have significant market power in the call termination on individual public telephone networks provided at a fixed-location wholesale market. Likewise, all mobile network operators were found to have significant market power in the call termination on individual mobile networks. In 2010, ANACOM found PT OpCo to have significant market power in the wholesale leased lines terminal market and segmented the transit segments between “C” and “NC” routes. In these wholesale markets, ANACOM included Ethernet connections and imposed a retail-minus rule over Ethernet solutions (which was never specified). In the “C” routes, PT OpCo has no significant market power. On August 14, 2014, ANACOM approved the final decisions regarding retail markets for fixed access and telephony services (Market 1/2007—Access to PSTN for residential and non-residential users and Markets 3, 4, 5, and 6/2003—publicly available telephone services provided at a fixed location), which are no longer regulated (https://www.anacom.pt/render.jsp?contentId=1311892). On July 23, 2015, ANACOM approved an urgent and interim decision regarding the market for wholesale leased lines, by which it reduced by 50% the wholesale price of CAM (Continent - Azores - Madeira) leased lines. On September 1, 2016, ANACOM approved the final decision regarding the analysis of the wholesale high-quality access at a fixed location (Market 4/2014), (https://www.anacom.pt/render.jsp?contentId=1394170): - For wholesale terminating segments of leased lines (including Ethernet) two sub-markets were defined: low-bandwidth (≤ 24 Mbps) and high-bandwidth (> 24 Mbps). Trunk segments of leased lines and international submarine cables are included. - ANACOM defined two geographic sub-markets (high-quality access and trunk segment of leased lines markets): competitive areas and non-competitive areas. Each submarine cable covers a different geographic market. - PT OpCo is considered to have significant market power in non-competitive areas and submarine cables, for which it is under the following obligations: providing access; transparency, including publication of reference offer; accounting separation; and non-discrimination. In noncompetitive areas of high-quality access, trunk segments of leased lines and submarine cables there are price control and cost accounting obligations. In ‘almost competitive areas’ of highquality access (non-competitive areas that tend to be competitive in the future) there is a margin squeeze test. On March 23, 2017, ANACOM approved the final decision regarding markets for wholesale local access at a fixed location – WLA (Market 3a/2014) and wholesale central access for mass-market products—WCA (Market 3b/2014) (https://www.anacom.pt/render.jsp?contentId=1407465). Wholesale local access at a fixed location includes copper, fiber and cable (although there was no cable wholesale access product actually offered in the market) and covers the entire Portuguese territory. PT OpCo is considered ----- to have significant market power and is subject to the following obligations regarding its copper and passive infrastructures: access to local loop unbundling (LLU); access to ducts and poles; cost orientation; nondiscrimination (EoI for duct and pole access, equivalence of output (EoO) for LLU and dark fiber); cost accounting and accounting separation; and transparency, including publication of a reference offer. For fiber no remedies were imposed, except for access to dark fiber when there is no duct or pole availability. Wholesale broadband access market includes the same products and two geographic sub-markets were defined: competitive areas and non-competitive areas. An area is considered to be competitive if: (i) there are at least two alternative operators (ANO) as well as PT OpCo, and each ANO has more than 50% NGA coverage (NGA meaning fiber and cable DOCSIS 3.0); or (ii) if there is one ANO with more than 50% NGA coverage, and PT OpCo’s retail market share in the parish is below 50%. PT OpCo is considered to have significant market power in non-competitive areas, for which it is subject to the following obligations on copper: providing access; cost orientation (plus margin squeeze test); non-discrimination; cost accounting and accounting separation; and transparency. No remedies were imposed on fiber. On October 4, 2018, ANACOM approved the final decision regarding retail market for call origination on fixed networks (Market 2/2007), which is no longer regulated (https://www.anacom.pt/render.jsp?contentId=1460547), except for price controls which remained in force for a period of 18 months.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,295,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE GROUP,295.190,Portugal,295.190.6,Our Concessions and Existing Licenses and Authorizations,"_General_ The EU prohibits any limitation on the number of new entrants in telecommunications markets, except as required to ensure efficient use of radio frequencies. Pursuant to this directive, which is part of the EU electronic communications framework, an operator must have a general authorization for the provision of electronic communications networks or services. A license for individual rights of use can be required for the use of radio frequencies or numbering resources. The objective of this authorization regime is to introduce more flexibility into the licensing framework. Currently, regarding the two concessions we hold, one regarding the provision of public payphone services, and another regarding the provision of directory services, which permit us to provide fixed line publicly available payphones and directory (printed) and directory inquiry services (by phone and online) in Portugal, the status is the following: (i) provision of public payphone services—the contract that supported the provision of this service, which should have been terminated on April 8, 2019, and was initially extended by the government until ANACOM selected a new provider or until the Communications Law was amended in order to waive such selection, but the Portuguese Court of Auditors (Tribunal de Contas) did not approve the extension of the agreement’s term so it was terminated with effects as of April 8, 2019; (ii) the provision of directory services— the contract that supported the provision of this service ended on September 14, 2018, however, at the request of the government, the provision of the directory inquiry services (by phone and online), was maintained; recently, the government has determined that the provision of this service should cease immediately. Until June 1, 2014, we were also the holders of the universal service public switched fixed-line concession, as described under “— _The Fixed-Line Concession” below._ We also operate a DTT platform and provide mobile telephone services, data communications services and television distribution services under the licenses granted and authorizations issued by the relevant authorities (the Portuguese government and ANACOM). The Ministry of Finance is responsible for monitoring financial issues with respect to our concessions. The Ministry of Planning and Infrastructure is responsible for all other issues regarding our concessions. Disputes concerning the application and interpretation of our concessions are resolved through arbitration. ANACOM is responsible for issuing regulations and is authorized to monitor and apply administrative penalties up to a maximum of €5 million and ancillary sanctions if we fail to fulfill our obligations under our concessions or other obligations imposed by law. _The Fixed-Line Concession_ The Portuguese government granted us a concession, held by PT OpCo, with an initial term expiring in 2025, which was terminated early after PT OpCo and the Portuguese government reached an agreement in November 2013 on its revocation, following the designation of ZON and Optimus—currently NOS, after the merger of the ----- two companies—as the universal service providers of access to a publicly available electronic communications network and telephone services at a fixed location. On March 7, 2014, Decree Law 35/2014 was published in the Portuguese official gazette, formally revoking our concession agreement pursuant to the November 2013 revocation agreement signed by us and the Portuguese government and also pursuant to Resolution of the Council of Ministers n. 66-A/2013, of October 18, 2013, that authorized that revocation agreement. The revocation became effective on June 1, 2014. As of that date, the fixed-line universal services are being provided by NOS, under a contract that ended on June 1, 2019 (the government has informed that after the termination of the contract it would not designate a new provider of this universal service). The revocation was due to, amongst other factors, a decision from the CJEU, of October 7, 2010, on the grounds that Law 5/2004, of February 10, 2004, whilst keeping in force PT OpCo’s universal services concession until 2025, did not comply with Directive 2002/22/CE, of the European Parliament and the Council, of March 7, 2002, as amended by Directive 2009/36/CE, of the European Parliament and the Council, of November 25, 2009. The fixed-line concession granted us the right to install, manage and operate the infrastructure that forms part of the basic telecommunications network. It also stipulated the provision of maritime mobile service, fixed telex service, fixed switched data transmission service and telegraph service, as services of public interest. Under the 2004 Communications Law, as the Universal Service Provider, PT OpCo was also obligated to provide a comprehensive directory and directory inquiry services. However, other than our ceasing to be the Universal Service Provider (except with respect to public payphones and directory services, which we have been awarded under new concession contracts), as described in “—Areas of Recent Regulation and Updates—Universal Service _Obligations” below, the revocation of the fixed-line concession will not cause any material change in the_ telecommunications services we are able to provide. Prior to the revocation of the fixed-line concession, the Portuguese government, by resolution of the Council of Ministers of January 10, 2013, determined that the maritime mobile service should cease to be provided as a service of public interest from April 30, 2013. After informing the subscribers of this service of the termination in advance, PT OpCo proceeded to terminate it. In addition, pursuant to the Resolution of the Council of Ministers published on October 18, 2013, fixed telex service, fixed switched data transmission service and telegraph service (telegrams) no longer had the nature of public services as of January 31, 2014, thus terminating PT OpCo’s legal obligation to assure their provision. The clients of the first two services were informed of such discontinuation in advance. PT OpCo opted to commercially continue the provision of fixed telegraph service as of February 1, 2014. _Our Public Payphones and Directory Services Concessions_ On October 12, 2012, in anticipation of the renegotiation of the fixed-line concession and following ANACOM’s decision on the designation of a universal service provider under a competitive process, PT OpCo submitted the single bid in the public tender for the provision of the publicly available telephones service and was awarded with the concession contract. The concession contract was entered into on February 20, 2014, for a period of five years. The conclusion of the public payphone installation ended on June 30, 2015. This contract was extended for another year by government’s ruling of April 9, 2019, but the Portuguese Court of Auditors (Tribunal de Contas) did not approve the extension of the agreement’s term so it was terminated with effects as of April 8, 2019. On July 29, 2013, the Portuguese government decided to initiate a direct award procedure in respect of the provision of comprehensive directory and directory inquiry services for a period of 12 months, with the possibility of such period being extended for an additional six months. As the only company that presented a proposal, on November 7, 2013, the Portuguese government awarded PT OpCo with the comprehensive directory and directory inquiry services concession. The concession contract was entered into on February 20, 2014. As mentioned above, the contract that supported the provision of this service ended on September 14, 2018. Following a request of the government, the provision of the directory inquiry services (by phone and online), was maintained. However, recently, the government has determined that the provision of this service by PT OpCo should cease and be run by ANACOM instead. Currently, the service is being provided by PT OpCo only to its clients, and PT OpCo is still awaiting a contact from ANACOM in connection with the migration of the service. _DTT Services_ For a summary of our usage rights for DTT, see “—Areas of Recent Regulation and Updates—DTT Services” below. ----- _Our Fixed-line, Data and Frequency Use Licenses_ We also hold the following licenses: (i) a non-exclusive license to provide fixed-line telephone services and be a “Public Telecommunications Networks” operator; (ii) the licenses formerly held by Telepac and other subsidiaries, including a data communications license; and (iii) frequency use licenses. Licenses have also been granted to other providers of data communications and internet access services, including companies associated with major international telecommunications providers. However, companies are not required to have a license to provide data communications services and internet access. Instead, it is sufficient to register their intended services with ANACOM under its service registration scheme. Since 1997, we have also held a license to provide data communications services using satellite infrastructure and a license to offer voice services to corporate networks and other closed groups of users. _PT OpCo Mobile Service License_ Portuguese mobile telephone service licenses are valid for 15 years and are issued by ANACOM. These licenses authorize the use of radio spectrum and the installation of base stations, base station controllers and control switching centers and require the licensee to construct networks capable of reaching at least 75% of Portugal’s population within a specified period. Charges for the provision of mobile telephone services are not subject to regulation. Through PT OpCo we hold a renewable license to provide traditional and GSM digital mobile telephone services throughout Portugal. The authorization for the use of GSM radio spectrum is valid until March 16, 2022. We are required to comply with a number of mobile telephone service criteria, including satisfying minimum quality standards regarding blocked call rates, network effectiveness and servicing time, and providing certain services. We are also required to provide ANACOM with information about our mobile telephone operations, including the number of customers, number and average duration of calls on a quarterly basis, and annual information about the development of infrastructure. ANACOM also issues UMTS licenses, which are the European version of the globally accepted technical standards for 3G mobile communications. The broadband capacity of the frequency spectrum allocated under the UMTS licenses enables operators to supply video and internet content to mobile telephones at higher transmission speeds. On January 5, 2012, ANACOM issued a final report on an auction for the allocation of rights of use of frequencies in the 450, 800, 900, 1800 MHz and 2.1 and 2.6 GHz bands. Following that auction, on March 9, 2012, ANACOM issued the final renewable license to PT OpCo, allowing the provision of electronic communications services based, among others, on LTE technology. This license is valid until March 2027, and it also unifies the previous GSM and UMTS licenses issued by ANACOM. On February 18, 2016, following a public consultation on the subject, ANACOM renewed PT OpCo’s right of use of the 1920-1980 MHz/2110-2170 MHz sub-bands by 15 years. The decision entered into effect on April 22, 2018. On February 6, 2020, ANACOM approved the project for the regulation of the 5G auction for the attribution of rights of use of frequencies in the 700, 900, 1800 MHz, 2.1, 2.6 and 3.6 GHz bands (5G), and subjected the project to a public consultation. The regulation was finally approved in October 2020 and published in November 2020. PT OpCo submitted a request to participate in the auction, which was accepted. The main auction phase started on January 14, 2021, and is still ongoing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,295,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE GROUP,295.190,Portugal,295.190.7,Areas of Recent Regulation and Updates,"_Number Portability and Carrier Selection_ Number portability allows a subscriber at a specific location to change service providers without having to change telephone numbers. Under ANACOM regulations, we are required to allow number portability for both fixed-line and mobile services within one working day, save for in exceptional circumstances duly identified. Call-by-call carrier selection enables customers to select the carrier of their calls by dialing a code connecting them to the selected carrier, while carrier pre-selection allows customers to select the carrier that will be their default carrier. ANACOM’s regulatory intervention in the wholesale market for call origination on the public telephone network provided at a fixed location for the provision of retail telephone services supported by indirect access (preselection or call-by-call selection) or the wholesale line reference offer ceased in 2018. Nevertheless, we were ----- subject, on a temporary basis, to price control obligations, which were lifted 18 months following the decision of October 4, 2018. _DTT Services_ PT OpCo holds frequency usage rights for DTT associated with the transport of the signal of free-to-air television channels (the RTP, SIC and TVI broadcast channels), the so-called “Multiplex A” or “Mux A”. PT OpCo is entitled to receive compensation or reimbursement, to be provided pursuant to a governmental ordinance, for the costs related to the channel update process which occurred in 2011 to allow the release of the 800 MHz band. The switch-off of the analog television network in Portugal occurred on April 26, 2012. Designed to ensure equal access to DTT, the DTT usage rights require PT OpCo to subsidize the installation and purchase of DTT-related equipment for individuals with special needs (e.g. the elderly, low income groups, etc.). In September 2014, ANACOM issued a decision authorizing PT OpCo to implement four additional MFN channels to function alongside its SFN network. In the decision ANACOM also expressed the view that in certain municipalities PT OpCo’s network does not comply with its license and therefore PT OpCo must implement an additional five MFN channels to function alongside its SFN network. PT OpCo considers itself to have fulfilled its obligations with respect to the usage grant and to have successfully concluded the channel update process and therefore has expressed its disagreement to ANACOM over the alleged breach of its obligations under its DTT license. In October 2015 ANACOM issued a decision on that matter and considered that the implementation of an additional five MFN channels was not necessary. In October 2015, ANACOM published a decision relating to DTT coverage in which it defined coverage obligations by municipality depending on population as well as what constituted a period of unavailability. PT OpCo had replied to the consultation that preceded this decision expressing its disagreement on certain matters, such as the definition of coverage obligations noted above, that, if implemented, may have a material impact on the fulfilment of its service obligations under its DTT license. PT OpCo initiated a legal proceeding against this decision which is still on-going. On September 22, 2016, following the enactment of Law 33/2016, of August 24, 2016 and the approval of the Resolution of the Council of Ministers 37-C/2016, of July 8, 2016, ANACOM issued a public consultation on its draft decision regarding an amendment to the conditions attached to the right of use of frequencies allocated to PT OpCo for DTT. On December 21, 2016, ANACOM issued its decision, through which, namely, two capacity reservations were removed and four new capacity reservation obligations were imposed, which intended: (i) for the broadcast of two national television program services, RTP3 and RTP Memória, in SDTV definition; and (ii) for the broadcast of two free-to-air unrestricted television program services in SDTV definition, to be licensed under Law 27/2007, of July 30, 2007. In June 2018 ANACOM issued the national roadmap for the release of the 700 MHz band, which is necessary for 5G mobile development within the framework of international agreements and the determinations of the European Parliament and of the Council. In October 2019 ANACOM issued its decision amending the national roadmap previously issued and approving the development plan for the migration of the DTT to the sub-700 MHz frequency band and the timeline to be followed by PT OpCo as well as imposing obligations to be followed by the latter necessary for the conclusion of the migration procedure. The decision established that the migration procedure would unfold gradually within a period of six months starting in January 2020, beginning from the country’s south to the north regions ending in the autonomous regions of Madeira and Azores. In order to offer support to the users, ANACOM would make available a call centre with a free phone-line. The national roadmap proposed by ANACOM and approved by the Secretary of State for Infrastructure provides for the adoption of the simplest migration scenario, through the maintenance of current technology and without the need for any period of simultaneous transmission. This scenario only entails the tuning of equipment to the new frequency, i.e. there will be no need to acquire any new equipment or repoint antennas. Despite the simplicity of the process, ANACOM offered support to users, as per the plan prepared accordingly. On March 27, 2020, ANACOM approved an amendment to the national roadmap for the 700 MHz band, following the decision issued by ANACOM on March 12, 2020, in which it decided to suspend the DTT network migration process due to reasons of force majeure, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 16, 2020, ANACOM approved the adjustment of the scheduling for the conclusion of the DTT network migration process in the context of the release of the 700 MHz band and the DTT network migration process resumed on August 12, 2020. On September 10, 2020, ANACOM approved the second amendment to the national roadmap for the ----- process of release of the 700 MHz band, in which it sets out the amendments to the migration plan and schedule. The migration started in February 2020, was temporarily interrupted due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was finally concluded on December 18, 2020. _Wholesale Reference Offers (Unbundling the Local Loop)_ The EC requires fixed-line network operators found to have significant market power in the relevant wholesale market for physical network infrastructure access at a fixed location to make the local loops between their customers and the local switches on their networks available to competitors. This allows such competitors to connect their networks to the copper local loop and use it to provide their services directly to those customers without having to invest in the local loop or to rely upon the network operator’s relationship with the customers. Under this regulation, we are required to maintain a reference offer for unbundled access to our local loops and related facilities and to meet reasonable requests for unbundled access to our local loops and related facilities under transparent, fair and non-discriminatory conditions. Prices charged must be cost-oriented. The conditions under which the local loop unbundling services are provided are set forth in a published reference offer for unbundled access to our local loops in accordance with terms established by ANACOM. This reference offer covers all of our main distribution framework buildings where technical and space conditions allow co-location. Co-location means providing space and technical facilities to competitors to the extent necessary to reasonably accommodate and connect the relevant equipment of the competitor. _Leased Lines Reference Offers and Ethernet Access Reference Offers_ Our Leased Lines Reference Offer (oferta de referência de circuitos alugados), or “ORCA”, sets forth the characteristics and the technical and commercial conditions associated with the provision of leased circuits by PT OpCo in the wholesale markets. Our Ethernet Accesses Reference Offer (oferta de referência de circuitos _Ethernet), or “ORCE”, sets forth the characteristics and the technical and commercial conditions associated with_ the provision of ethernet circuits by PT OpCo in the wholesale markets. Following a decision by ANACOM on leased line markets, the retail leased-line market was deregulated meaning that our prices in this market ceased to be subject to a 26% retail-minus rule. However, for the wholesale leasedline markets, in which we were declared an operator with significant market power, ANACOM decided to make Ethernet circuits subject to a retail-minus rule (which remains undefined by ANACOM). On June 14, 2012, ANACOM approved a final decision amending our ORCA and ORCE, the draft decision of which has been provided to the EC (which has subsequently stated it had no comment to the action), BEREC and national regulatory authorities of other EU Member States. PT Opco challenged this decision before the courts, arguing that the decision was illegal in certain respects; however, PT OpCo dropped the proceedings in 2021. On July 23, 2015, ANACOM approved an urgent and interim decision regarding the market for wholesale leased lines, by which it reduced by 50% the wholesale price of CAM (Continent - Azores - Madeira) leased lines. On September 1, 2016, following the analysis of the market for high-quality wholesale access at a fixed location (market 4), ANACOM imposed a reduction of 72.8% in the price of Ethernet leased lines (capacity of up to 10 Gbps) between Mainland Portugal and the Autonomous Regions of the Azores and Madeira (CAM circuits) and between the various islands of each region (inter-island circuits), where supported on PT OpCo’s submarine cables. The reduction came on top of a 50% reduction ordered by ANACOM in July 2015 as part of an urgent adopted measure. In total, the reduction in prices totaled 86% over one year. We have challenged the 2015 decision before the courts. Subsequently, (i) on March 1, 2019, ANACOM imposed a reduction of 10% in the price of Ethernet leased lines (capacity of up to 10 Gbps) for the CAM circuits and of 6% for the inter-island circuits, (ii) on February 2, 2020, it imposed a reduction of 10% in the price of Ethernet leased lines (capacity of up to 10 Gbps) for the CAM circuits and of 4% for the inter-island circuits and (iii) on March 3, 2021, it imposed a reduction of 10% in the price of Ethernet leased lines (capacity of up to 10 Gbps) for the CAM circuits and established the maintenance of the prices for the inter-island circuits. On October 12, 2017, ANACOM approved the amendments to the ORCA and to the ORCE, whose final decision draft had been notified to the EC, the BEREC and the national regulatory authorities of the other EU Member States. By letter dated September 28, 2017, the EC stated it had no comments on the final decision draft. ----- _Co-installation Obligations_ The June 14, 2012, decision regarding PT OpCo’s ORCA and ORCE, ANACOM extended PT OpCo’s coinstallation obligations under its regulated reference offers to its submarine cable landing stations (ECS). The obligation remains in place by force of the decision of September 1, 2016, which specifies that co-location may take place in the ECS itself, in spaces adjacent or remote. _Wholesale Market for Voice Call Termination on Individual Mobile Networks_ The regulation of the market for wholesale voice call termination establishes a price control obligation on wholesale voice call termination services. Following EC recommendations on the regulatory treatment of fixed and mobile termination rates in the EU, this price control results in a cost-oriented price cap determined by a pure Long-Run Average Incremental Cost, or “LRIC”, bottom-up cost model. On July 21, 2018, ANACOM approved its decision regarding the specification on price control obligation in the wholesale market for voice call termination on individual mobile networks (Market 2/2014). The maximum price to be applied by the three mobile operators considered to have significant market power was set at €0.42 per minute, billed per second from the first second and independent of the origin of the call. From July 1, 2019 that price decreased to €0.40 per minute, following the yearly update of the inputs used in the model to determine such price. On February 20, 2020, ANACOM determined that from July 1, 2020, the maximum termination price for voice calls in mobile networks to be applied by mobile operators with significant market power would be further decreased to €0.36 per minute. _Next Generation Access Networks_ By decision of March 23, 2017, ANACOM approved the analysis of markets 3a and 3b, in which it identified as relevant for the purposes of ex ante regulation the wholesale local access market provided at a fixed location; and the market of wholesale central access provided at a fixed location (for major consumer products) in Areas NC (non-competitive). Areas C (competitive) are not subject to ex ante regulation, and correspond to 466 parishes out of a total of 3092. ANACOM imposed in both markets (3a and 3b-NC) obligations of access to the network and use of specific network resources, of non-discrimination, transparency, accounting separation, price control and cost accounting and financial report. ANACOM didn’t impose access to PT OpCo’s optic fiber network, as it considered sufficient the obligations, imposed at national level, of access to ducts and poles, as well as copper network access obligations which PT OpCo is also required to meet. In September 2019, ANACOM issued a decision regarding the amendments made by PT OpCo to its reference wholesale offer for the access to ducts (Oferta de Referência de Acesso a Condutas) and reference wholesale offer for the access to ducts (Oferta de Referência de Acesso a Postes). With respect to the roll-out of optic fiber networks, current Portuguese law establishes a legal framework for the construction of and access to infrastructure suitable for the accommodation of electronic communications networks and the construction of infrastructure for telecommunications in housing developments, urban settlements and concentrations of buildings. The law addresses access to the public domain, expropriation and the constitution of public easements, and amendments to existing law in 2009 introduced a new level of harmonization and transparency in procedures. In particular, the 2009 changes set forth several obligations in order to allow electronic communications operators to enjoy better conditions necessary for the installation and development of electronic communications networks. The current legal framework also foresees the implementation of a Centralized Information System (“SIIA”), to be managed and operated by ANACOM and whose main objective is to make available information on infrastructure appropriate for the installation of electronic communications networks based on information provided by the Portuguese government, autonomous regions, municipalities, publicly held companies or concessionaires, other entities owning or using infrastructure in the public domain, autonomous regions or municipalities and electronic communications undertakings. Other elements, such as the terms upon which objects will be geographically defined through the combination of their administrative location and georeferencing, are also set forth. SIIA became available on January 14, 2016. ----- On May 15, 2014, Directive 2014/61, on measures to reduce the cost of deploying high-speed electronic communications networks, was enacted and transposition by Member-States should have occurred no later than January 1, 2016. Directive 2014/61 was transposed by Decree Law 92/2017, of July 31, 2017, which has modified Decree Law 123/2009, of May 21, 2009. Decree Law 92/2017, of July 31, 2017, established several obligations regarding the Adequate Infrastructures Information System, formerly SIC, in order to make available permanently updated information on appropriate infrastructures. It has also extended the range of situations in which can be requested the intervention of ANACOM to dispute resolutions. On September 9, 2013, the EC published the recommendation on non-discrimination and NGA cost models, included in the presentation and proposal of the so-called Connected Continent package. The (non-binding) recommendation aims to promote investment and innovation in new network infrastructures, while ensuring effective competition. In particular, it seeks to: (i) ensure an effective level playing field through the application of stricter rules on non-discrimination; (ii) set predictable and stable prices for access to copper networks; and (iii) increase regulatory certainty as to the circumstances that should lead to the non-imposition of regulated prices for wholesale access to next-generation networks. _Cost Accounting System (“CAS”)_ PT OpCo runs an activity-based, fully-distributed historical cost model, first developed following the privatization of the company in 1995. The CAS is also a regulatory obligation imposed on PT OpCo within the scope of our concession and relevant market regulations. On March 19, 2020, ANACOM declared the conformity of PT OpCo’s CAS for the exercise of 2017 with the applicable regulatory dispositions and approved determinations concerning the improvement of the CAS. On June 30, 2020, PT OpCo submitted to ANACOM the results of its CAS for year 2019; complementary information was sent subsequently. On December 4, 2020, ANACOM declared the conformity of PT OpCo’s CAS for the exercise of 2018 with the applicable regulatory dispositions and approved determinations concerning the improvement of the CAS. _Regulation on the settlement and collection of regulatory fees_ According to the Administrative Rule 1473-B/2008 of December 17, 2008, all providers are subject to the payment of a regulatory fee for the provision of electronic communications networks and services, through which they cover the administrative regulatory costs of ANACOM. By deliberation dated November 12, 2020, ANACOM approved the report concerning its administrative costs and the amount resulting from the collection of the fees owed by the suppliers of networks and electronic telecommunication services for 2020. The contributory percentage t2 was set at 0.8102% for a total of €33,819,903 of administrative costs. It is worth noting that t2 has increased sustainably throughout the years (in spite of a small decrease in the 2019 contributory percentage), as can be seen from the series below: - 2009 - 0,4040% - 2010 - 0,4133% - 2011 - 0,4361% - 2012 - 0,4590% - 2013 - 0,5490% - 2014 - 0,5909% - 2015 - 0,6214% ----- - 2016 - 0,6885% - 2017 - 0,7195% - 2018 - 0,7915% - 2019 - 0,7851% - 2020 - 0,8102% _Universal Service Obligations_ Until June 1, 2014, we had obligations as a universal service provider under the fixed-line concession for public telecommunications service. Universal services are divided into three functions: (i) connection to a public telecommunications network at a fixed location and the provision of public telephone services; (ii) publicly available telephones; and (iii) comprehensive directory and directory inquiry services. Under the tender for designation of the Universal Service Provider described below, these functions are further divided into three geographic regions: North, Center and South and Islands. On October 12, 2012, following ANACOM’s decision on the designation of a universal service provider, the Portuguese Ministries of Finance, Economy and Employment launched a public tender to designate universal service providers for each of the three functions described above (referred to as Tender 1, Tender 2 and Tender 3 respectively), which included a compensation fund for universal service providers, as described below, and a related renegotiation of our concession which led to its revocation. To select the company responsible for providing a comprehensive directory and a directory inquiry service, the criterion was the highest remuneration payable to the Portuguese government. The granting period for each of the services was set at five years. Pursuant to the qualifying report issued on February 2, 2013, PT OpCo qualified for each of the Tender 1, Tender 2 and Tender 3 categories. The deadline for the submission of proposals for each of these tenders was March 15, 2013. PT OpCo, ZON and Optimus presented bids for Tender 1, PT OpCo presented the only bid for Tender 2, and no bids were presented for Tender 3. On April 18, 2013, ANACOM published a preliminary report regarding the bids for Tenders 1 and 2, as there was no bidder in Tender 3. In accordance with this report, PT OpCo did not present the lowest bid in Tender 1 (which was the relevant criterion for this tender) and, as such, it did not qualify to be designated as the universal service provider of access to a public telecommunications network at a fixed location. PT OpCo’s services in this regard ceased on June 1, 2014. See “—Our Concessions and Existing Licenses and Authorizations—The Fixed-Line _Concession” above._ PT OpCo submitted the lowest bid for Tender 2. On October 18, 2013, the Portuguese government confirmed these results and determined the designation of Optimus and ZON as the universal service providers for the connection to a public electronic communications network at a fixed location and the provision of publicly available telephone services, and of PT OpCo as the universal service provider for publicly available telephone (payphones). In addition, on November 7, 2013, PT OpCo was awarded by the Portuguese government with the comprehensive directory and directory inquiry services concession. See “—Our Concessions and Existing Licenses and _Authorizations—Our Public Payphones and Directory Services Concessions”._ Furthermore, even in the cases where PT OpCo is the universal services provider, we will be required to contribute to the compensation fund for universal services providers according to our share of the revenues of the national telecommunications sector. By a deliberation dated August 1, 2013, ANACOM approved the draft decision on the final results of the audit to NCUS resubmitted by PT OpCo for 2007 to 2009: €23,584,976.93 in 2007, €20,168,431.93 in 2008 and €23,057,573.48 in 2009. This draft decision was submitted to prior hearing of the interested parties and public consultation. On September 19, 2013, ANACOM approved the final decision having maintained the values proposed on the draft decision. On August 19, 2013, following a deliberation by ANACOM dated June 20, 2013, regarding the decision on the results of the audit to NCUS for 2007 to 2009, PT OpCo sent to ANACOM new values for the NCUS in 2010 and 2011, according to the final, settled methodology. According to Law 35/2012, which established the compensation ----- fund for the universal service of electronic communications, for the financing of the NCUS, on October 31, 2013, PT OpCo submitted to ANACOM the calculation of the NCUS for 2012, taking into account the deliberations of the Regulatory Authority concerning the methodology of calculation of the NCUS and the recommendations made in the audit of the NCUS for 2007 to 2009. After submission to prior hearing of the interest parties and to public consultation, ANACOM approved on June 12, 2014, the final results of the audit to NCUS submitted by PT OpCo for 2010 and 2011: €24,662,548.33 and €25,205,213.31, respectively. On September 25, 2014, ANACOM approved the draft decision on the final results of the audit to NCUS resubmitted by PT OpCo for 2010 and 2011: €23,522,982.66 and €23,527,625.33, respectively. This draft decision was then submitted to prior hearing of the interested parties and public consultation. On November 20, 2014, ANACOM approved the final decision having maintained the values proposed on the draft decision. On September 16, 2015, ANACOM approved the final results of the audit to NCUS submitted by PT OpCo for 2012, in the amount of €26,423,507.39, after being submitted to prior hearing of the interest parties and to public consultation. On December 17, 2015, ANACOM approved—also after being submitted to prior hearing of the interest parties and to public consultation—the final results of the audit to NCUS submitted by PT OpCo for 2013, in the amount of €20,343,490.71. On October 27, 2016, ANACOM approved—after being submitted to prior hearing of the interest parties and to public consultation—the final results of the audit to NCUS submitted by PT OpCo for 2014, in the amount of €7,724,670.71. On January 26, 2017, ANACOM approved the final results of the NCUS incurred by PT OpCo in 2015, in the amount of €2,466,599.66 (Public Payphones concession) and €189,132.39 (Directory Services concession). On January 26, 2018, ANACOM approved the final results of the NCUS incurred by PT OpCo in 2016, in the amount of €2,466,386.37 (Public Payphones concession) and €636,078.95 (Directory Services concession). On January 17, 2019, ANACOM approved the final results of the NCUS incurred by PT OpCo in 2017, in the amount of €2,464,144.53 (Public Payphones concession) and €635,431.40 (Directory Services concession); however, on January 31, 2019, ANACOM dispensed PT OpCo from making the relevant contributions to the NCUS. On January 17, 2020, ANACOM approved the final results of the NCUS incurred by PT OpCo in 2018, in the amount of €2,466,600.00 (Public Payphones concession) and €446,355.35 (Directory Services concession). On January 28, 2021, ANACOM approved the final results of the NCUS incurred by PT OpCo in 2019, in the amount of €662,128.84 (Public Payphones concession). _Network Security_ On December 12, 2013, ANACOM approved a decision on the circumstances, format, and procedures applicable to reports regarding security breaches or loss of integrity with a significant impact on the functioning of electronic communications networks and services available to the public. This decision also sets forth the conditions under which ANACOM considers there is a public interest in disclosing information regarding those events to the public. Further, we implemented all the necessary measures to comply with this decision by June 12, 2014, which required implementing new procedures and adapting information systems to produce the relevant information to notify to ANACOM. On March 14, 2019, ANACOM approved the ANACOM Regulation 303/2019 on the security and integrity of electronic communications networks and services. This Regulation establishes the obligation to identify the assets of companies whose operation is critical and should be classified and inventoried. It also establishes the strengthening of the capacity of articulation between ANACOM and the companies of the sector, whether in response times or in terms of contents, as well as with other sectors that depend on electronic communications. The new rules also foresee the appointment of a security ----- officer and the adoption of a security policy at companies that offer public communications networks or electronic communications services accessible to the public. The regulation is based on the clear identification that the good operation of the networks and services is important in normal daily situations, but above all in emergency situations in which preparation and planning is crucial, and mutual assistance is determinant to achieving common goals. The diploma came into force on April 2, in its entirety but provides for several obligations to be implemented in a phased manner. _Cloud Computing_ The EC issued a review of cloud computing in Europe with the goal of enabling and facilitating its adoption throughout all sectors of the economy with the goal of cutting ICT costs and boosting productivity, growth and jobs. The EC put forward a set of measures that, in its view, are key to promoting cloud computing and ensuring users’ rights. On December 12, 2012, the Directorate General for Justice organized a workshop on cloud computing contracts, with the purpose of exploring stakeholders’ experiences and views on cloud computing contracts with the EC. The EC and stakeholders discussed possible future developments of the market, issues relating to cloud computing contracts, based on existing practice, the economic impact of these issues in cloud computing contracts and the possible ways forward. The EC considered the workshop a first step to find a precise feasible mandate for an expert group that was formed in September 2013 to address cloud computing issues pertaining to fair and balanced contract terms, trust of consumers and users and increased legal certainty. The EC published on June 24, 2014 its Cloud Service Level Agreement Standardisation Guidelines. On April 19, 2016, building on its earlier work on this area, the EC issued a communication (COM(2016) 178 final) on the European Cloud Initiative—Building a competitive data and knowledge economy in Europe, where it announced that the “European Cloud Initiative will be complemented by further action under the Digital Single Market Strategy covering cloud contracts for business users and switching of cloud services providers. _Cinema Law_ The Law 55/2012, of September 6, 2012 (the “Cinema Law”), as amended by Law 28/2014, of May 19, 2014, by Law 82-B/2014, of December 31, 2014, and by Law 74/2020, of November 19, 2020, establishes the Portuguese government action principles in the promotion, development and protection of the art of cinema and cinematographic and audio-visual activities, which imposes obligations on television distributors and operators of video-on-demand services. As a result, on one hand, television distributors are obligated to reverse charge an annual fee for each subscription of television services (€2 per subscription) by July 1 of the following year to which the data reported relates (as per the rules of Decree Law 25/2018, of April 24, 2018), as well as the obligation to provide to the Portuguese Cinema and Audiovisual Institute (Instituto do Cinema e do Audiovisual), or “ICA”, with the reports that were sent to ANACOM regarding the number of television services subscribers. On the other hand, operators of video-on-demand services are obligated to invest 1% of video-on-demand services revenues. Additionally, from 2021 onwards, operators of subscription video-on-demand services will also be obligated to deliver to ICA 1% of such service’s revenues. A new regulation regarding these two obligations is still to be issued. _Roaming_ The EC regulates the roaming charges that may be charged in the wholesale market and the retail market in Europe. These regulations extend to data and SMS, or text messaging. On July 1, 2012, the previous roaming regulations were replaced by a new version, known as “Roaming III”, which will expire on June 30, 2022. In addition to setting maximum voice roaming rates (subject to a glide path) that may be charged with respect to the wholesale market, retail market, data and SMS, Roaming III also features (i) extended transparency and consumer-protection measures (“bill-shock”) that go beyond the EU territory, (ii) a cap on retail data roaming communications, (iii) the introduction of an obligation for mobile operators in the wholesale market to provide reasonable network access in order to allow roaming services and (iv) the decoupling of roaming services from other services, while enabling a consumer to use the same number, no later than July 1, 2014. On July 1, 2013, the new price caps, valid until July 2014, entered into force: ----- - For voice calls, €0.24 per minute (retail) for outgoing calls and €0.07 per minute (retail) and €0.10 per minute (wholesale) for incoming calls; - For outgoing SMS, €0.08 (retail) and €0.02 (wholesale); and - For data traffic, €0.45 per MB (retail) and €0.15 per MB (wholesale). - As of July 1, 2014, the price caps, valid until June 30, 2017 (retail level), and June 30, 2022 (wholesale level), if not revised before, shall be: - For voice calls, €0.19 per minute (retail) for outgoing calls and €0.05 per minute (retail and wholesale) for incoming calls; - For outgoing SMS, €0.06 (retail) and €0.02 (wholesale); and - For data traffic, €0.20/MB (retail) and €0.05/MB (wholesale). On March 18, 2013, BEREC published its guidelines on the interpretation and implementation of Roaming Regulation III, except with regard to Articles 3, 4 and 5 concerning the wholesale access and the separate sale of roaming services. Issues concerning wholesale access had already been object of specific guidelines, published on September 27, 2012, and the separate roaming services (single IMSI and LBO—Local break-out) sale was also object of specific guidance, published on July 5, 2013. Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 of 25 November, introduced the so called TSM (“Telecom Single Market”) which, among other dispositions, brought very important modifications to Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union. As part of this regulation the Roam Like At Home (RLAH) regime entered into force on June 15, 2017. Since that date roaming providers are no longer allowed to levy surcharges in addition to the domestic retail price on roaming customers in any EU Member State for regulated roaming calls made or received, for regulated roaming SMS messages sent and for regulated data roaming services used (there was a transitory period of “RLAH+” between April 30, 2016 and June 14, 2017, in which providers could still apply a surcharge in addition to the domestic retail price for the provision of regulated retail roaming services). Roaming providers may implement a ‘fair use policy’ (“FUP”) in order to prevent abusive or anomalous usage, as per the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/2286 of December 15. Above the FUP limit, surcharges may be applied as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Such fees were revised by Administrative Rule 157/2017 of May 10, 2017, amending Administrative Rule 1473-B/2008 of December 17, 2008. ERC also collects annual regulation fees regarding some of our activities, namely regarding television distribution and social media (Portal SAPO—news aggregator). Municipalities collect a municipal fee for rights of way (the “MFRW”), established in the 2004 Communications Law, based on the provider’s turnover concerning end users in each municipality. The fee is freely established by each municipality, up to a maximum of 0.25% of each wireline services bill and is supported the operators whose network infrastructures are located in each such municipality (without the possibility of making them reflect on the customers). It is our, and the courts, understanding that this MFRW exempts us from the payment of other municipal taxes related with rights of way, so PT OpCo has challenged in court all the taxes applied by municipalities regarding rights of way, on the grounds that these represent double taxation, and the courts (in all instances, up to the Portuguese Supreme Administrative Court) ruled in favor of PT OpCo’s position.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The Regulation imposed EU-wide rules on safeguarding open internet access (net neutrality) from April 30, 2016, requiring providers of internet access services to treat all traffic equally, and establishing a right of all end-users to access and distribute legal content, applications and services of their choice. Providers may use reasonable traffic management measures that are to be based on objective technical requirements, not commercial considerations. Blocking or throttling are allowed only in a limited number of circumstances listed in the Regulation, for instance to block illegal content, counter a cyber attack or deal with exceptional or temporary traffic congestion. Agreements on services optimized for specific content are allowed where optimization is necessary, but providers must ensure the general quality of internet access services. Examples of such specialized services are managed IPTV and high-definition video conferencing. ‘Zero-rating’ practices are not explicitly banned. This means such practices will have to be assessed by the NRAs on a case-by-case basis to establish harm to end-users before they can be prohibited. On August 2016, BEREC published a set of Guidelines regarding the implementation of the net neutrality rules by European NRAs. _Intra-EU communications_ Regulation (EU) 2018/1971 of December 11, among other dispositions, amended TSM, by introducing rules regarding maximum retail prices for intra-EU communications. As such, from May 15, 2019, any retail price (excluding VAT) charged to consumers for regulated intra-EU communications shall not exceed EUR 0.19 per minute for calls and EUR 0.06 per SMS message. The regulation covers only consumption based intra-EU communications services offered to consumers and is applicable to both fixed and mobile calls and SMS. In addition to the regulated tariff, providers may offer alternative tariffs covering non-EEA countries including intra-EU communications where the prices of intra-EU communications may exceed the caps; consumers should have the option to deliberately choose such tariffs. On March 7, 2019, BEREC published a set Guidelines regarding this theme. _Interconnection The Interconnection Framework. The EU Access and Interconnection Directive requires that interconnection_ services be made available in a non-discriminatory manner. The EU Access and Interconnection Directive encourages commercial negotiations among operators but requires national regulatory authorities to establish mechanisms for effective dispute resolution. According to the EU Access and Interconnection Directive, all telecommunications companies with significant market power in the call origination or termination markets must: - make interconnection access to their networks available to other network operators; - not discriminate between interconnection customers; - provide to those requesting interconnection the information and technical specifications necessary for them to interconnect their networks; - offer interconnection prices that are transparent and cost-oriented and do not discriminate between interconnection customers; and - maintain a separate accounting system for interconnection activities. ----- The EU Access and Interconnection Directive established the general conditions for access and interconnection among telecommunications operators in competitive markets. It guarantees the rights of new entrants to obtain interconnection from telecommunications operators with significant market power. ANACOM is entitled to review and modify our proposed interconnection rates and arrangements in our reference interconnection offer. ANACOM has established an overall interconnection framework based on cost that is consistent with the EU legal framework for both wireline and mobile services. _Wireline Interconnection. ANACOM regulates call termination on individual public telephone networks provided_ at a fixed location within the scope of market analysis and significant market power designations. As a result, we are subject to price controls in these markets based on our costs and other factors and must publish a reference offer that includes these prices and quality of service standards. The obligation imposed on significant market power operators to meet all reasonable requests for supply of fixed call termination services, under fair and reasonable conditions, applies on an equal basis to TDM and IP interconnection. The specific conditions relating to IP interconnection were the object of a decision by ANACOM (dated January 5, 2018), following a proposal submitted by PT OpCo and discussed with the other providers. _Mobile Interconnection. All mobile operators are considered to have significant market power in call termination_ in mobile networks market. ANACOM has imposed price controls on interconnection rates for the termination of calls on mobile networks (see the evolution of values in section “—Wholesale Market for Voice Call Termination _on Individual Mobile Networks” above). These reductions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a_ significant impact on PT OpCo’s interconnection revenues and consequently its earnings. _Fixed Interconnection. All fixed operators are considered to have significant market power in call termination in_ fixed networks market. ANACOM has imposed price controls on interconnection rates for the termination of calls on fixed networks. In its decision of February 2020, it set a fixed termination rate (“FTR”) at €0.046, which applies from October 2020. ANACOM has issued successive decisions that have reduced mobile termination rates over time. The reductions in mobile termination rates have had, and will continue to have, a negative effect on our cash flows and revenues. _Pricing for Mobile Origination Rates_ In January 2012, the Portuguese Competition Authority completed an analysis on mobile rates for originating calls, finding origination rates to be excessive and stating that mobile operators must reduce their rates to the level of their costs by July 2012 or face the possibility of being sanctioned. All three mobile network operators decided to reduce its mobile originating rates between €0.07 and €0.0975 and no subsequent action from the Authority is expected. _Internet and Related Services_ Various regulatory developments may affect our internet business. A Data Retention Directive (Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and the Council, of March 15) was adopted by the EC in 2006, that imposed data-retention obligations on operators. The law implementing this directive, more specifically, Law 32/2008 of July 17, 2008, requires internet service providers and other electronic communications providers to preserve data for a specified period of time and imposes other obligations in this area. _Regulatory Proceedings_ We are regularly involved in regulatory inquiries and investigations involving our operations. In addition, ANACOM, the EC, the Portuguese Competition Authority and ERC regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These investigations are described in more detail in “Description of Our Business—Legal Proceedings—Portugal”.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

(“Law 153-98”), resolutions issued by the telecommunications regulator on the grounds of Law 153-98 and various decrees of the Executive Power on matters related to the National Plan of Attribution of Frequencies (“PNAF”). We believe that we hold all necessary licenses to operate our business. On July 15, 1996, Altice Dominicana was awarded a nineteen-year universal telecom concession, which allows it to provide telecom services without any technological restrictions (e.g. fixed/wireless technologies, television and internet). An automatic twenty-year renewal process is set forth in the concession agreement unless either party served three years’ notice of an intention not to renew. Since neither party served such a notice, the renewal process under the concession began automatically in August 2014. Altice Dominicana is also subject to Law No. 153-98 which provides for a renewal process of the concession. On April 4, 2014 Indotel authorized Orange Dominicana, S. A. to transfer its social control in favor of Altice Dominican Republic II, S.A.S. Further, on December 19, 2016 Indotel ordered the registration of the change of business name of the concessionaire Orange Dominicana, S.A. to Altice Hispaniola, S.A. Furthermore, on May 9, 2018, Indotel ordered the registration of the change of business name of the concessionaire Altice Hispaniola, S. A. to Altice Dominicana, S. A. Also, on April 27, 2015, Altice Dominicana presented a formal renewal request of its concession agreement to Indotel, and since Indotel has not expressly ----- denied such request, the concession and all of its related authorizations and licenses have been renewed de facto for 20 years effective from August 2015 pursuant to article 27.2 of Law 153-98. However, Indotel has not yet provided a template of the proposed new concession agreements to be signed with local operators in similar situation (concessions granted on or before Law 153-98). The Constitution of the Dominican Republic guarantees freedom of enterprise, trade and industry among other individual and social rights, in addition to the industry specific legal framework. The Constitution specifically sets forth that monopolies shall not be permitted except in favor of the Dominican State and must be created by law. The Dominican Constitution provides that the secrecy of telegraphic, telephonic, cable graphic, electronic, telematics or established by another means of communication, shall not be breached, except by an order of a judge or competent authority, in accordance with the law.

Law 153-98 provides a basic framework to regulate the installation, maintenance and operation of telecommunications networks and the rendering of telecommunications services. Law 153-98 reaffirms the “Universal Service Principle” by guaranteeing access to telecommunications services at affordable prices in lowincome rural and urban areas. Law 153-98 created the “Contribution to the Development of Telecommunications” consisting of a 2% tax fund for the development of the telecommunications sector that is payable by customers and collected by telecommunications providers from customers based on billings to customers for telecommunications services. According to Law 153-98, Indotel is the regulatory body created as a decentralized state entity, with operational, jurisdictional and financial autonomy, with its own patrimony and legal personality, responsible for guaranteeing the existence of sustainable, fair, and effective competition in the rendering of public telecommunications services as well as ensuring the efficient use of the public domain of the radio electric spectrum. Law 153-98 sets forth the responsibilities, authorities and procedures of the regulator. Indotel is made up of a Board of Directors and an Executive Director. The Board of Directors is the highest authority of Indotel, composed of five members designated by the Executive Power. Among other management powers, Indotel administers the entrance and participation of the telecommunications service providers in the Dominican telecommunications market, and has various functions including (i) granting, expanding and revoking concessions and licenses under the conditions provided for by the laws in force, allowing the entrance of new providers of telecommunications services; (ii) managing and administering the spectrum orbit resources, including the management of the orbital portions of the telecommunications satellites with their respective bands of frequencies, as well as the satellite orbits for Dominican satellites which may exist and coordinating their use and operation with international entities and organisms and with other countries; (iii) controlling the compliance with obligations of the concessionaires of public telecommunications services and of the users of the radio electric spectrum, protecting the right of defense of the parties in its actions. Law 153-98 promotes competition in all telecommunications services by enforcing the right to interconnect with existing participants and ensuring against monopolistic practices, and at the same time upholding those concessions that are operational. Law 153-98 provides that the regulator shall ensure charges are non ----- discriminatory, strengthening effective and sustainable competition. In case of disagreement between the parties, the regulator shall intervene by means of a motivated resolution, taking as parameters the costs, including a reasonable remuneration for the investment, calculated according to the “Regulation of tariffs and costs of the services”. In accordance with Law 153-98 a concession granted by Indotel is required for providing public Telecommunications services to third parties, with the exceptions set forth in Law 153-98. The authorization process is governed by “Regulation for Telecommunication Services Authorizations” contained in Resolution No. 036-19, issued by the Board of Directors of Indotel (“Resolution 036-19”). Pursuant to Law 153-98 a license granted by Indotel shall be required for the use of the public radio electric domain, with the exceptions set forth in the corresponding regulations. The authorization process is governed by Resolution 036-19. When concessions and licenses are required for the rendering of a public telecommunications service, they shall be granted simultaneously. According to Law No. 153-98 the transfer, assignment, lease or granting of rights of use of any title or the creation of a lien on licenses shall be performed, under penalty of forfeiture, prior to authorization of the regulating authority, which authorization may not be denied without justified cause. The acquirer shall meet all the conditions imposed on the grantor and shall be ruled by the same obligations as the concessionaire or licensee. Law No. 153-98 constitutes the ratifying instrument of the Fourth Protocol attached to the General Agreement on Commerce of Services (GATS) concerning negotiations on basic telecommunications of the World Trade Organization (WTO), for liberalization of telecommunication services. Law No. 153-98 provides the corresponding regulatory framework to comply with the liberalization commitments undertaken pursuant to said agreement and to guarantee the efficient provision of telecommunications services.

Some of such resolutions regulating certain areas of telecommunications in the Dominican Republic are as follows: - Resolution 110-12 dated August 9, 2012 by means of which Indotel’s Board of Directors approved the General Regulation for Telephone Services amended by Indotel’s Board of Directors Resolutions numbers 62-17 dated October 25, 2017, that approved the Regulation on the Rights and Obligations of Users and Providers of Public Telecommunications Services and 003-13 of January 22, 2013, that approved the amendments to the General Regulation for Telephone Services. The principal purpose of this regulation is to set forth a regulatory framework governing relations between the public telephone service providers and their customers and users, in all its forms (post-paid or pre-paid), regardless of the technology used to provide the service, in order to guarantee the rights of each party explicitly maintaining their respective obligations. The abovementioned regulation sets forth basics rights of users, including: (i) access to telephone services in terms of continuity, generality, equality, neutrality, transparency and quality, in accordance with the principles of the Telecommunications General Law No. 153-98; (ii) their right to choose their service provider; (iii) their right to have a phone number and numeric portability; (iv) their right to sign a contract in accordance with terms, conditions and rights set forth in this regulation; (v) their right to cancel the service in accordance with the procedure indicated in this regulation. This regulation considers as “abusive clauses” those imposing conditions on users that affect their interests and rights, and those that are disproportionate, or contrary to the laws, regulations and standards. According to Article 14.2 of the General Regulation for Telephone Services approved by Indotel’s Board of Directors Resolution 110-12 amended by Indotel’s Board of Directors Resolution No. 003-13, abusive clauses on contracts will be unenforceable. Indotel shall require the amendment of abusive clauses such as to make them conform to reasonable standards. If telecommunications service providers do not amend the contract, Indotel may unilaterally enforce the amendment. ----- - Resolution No. 64-11 dated July 27, 2011, approved the bill of the National Frequency Allocation Plan (PNAF) drafted by Indotel to be submitted to the Executive Power for its final approval. Decree 520-11 dated August 25, 2011, issued by the Executive Power approved the new PNAF and repealed Decree of the Executive Power No. 518-02 dated July 5, 2002. The new PNAF approved by Decree 520-11 seeks to optimize and rationalize the use of the radio electric spectrum to efficiently satisfy present and future frequency needs with regard to all systems, equipment and devices that send or receive radio electric waves within the national territory. According to the PNAF, migration of services shall not restrain the correct functioning of services provided. Indotel is in charge of deciding, applying and resolving all matters arising in connection with the frequencies allocation and migration. On January 23, 2019 Indotel’s Board of Directors ordered the beginning of a public consultation process to amend the PNAF approved by Decree 520-11 (Resolution No. 004-19). - Resolution No. 156-06 dated August 30, 2006, issued by the Board of Directors of Indotel, that approves the General Regulation related to Numeric Portability, among other resolutions issued by the Board of Directors of Indotel related to numeric portability. This Resolution was modified by Indotel’s Board of Directors Resolutions numbers 065-08 of April 22, 2008, 01509 dated February 13, 2009, 015-15 dated July 8, 2015, 037-15 of December 9, 2015, issued by the Board of Directors of Indotel. - Resolution No. 022-05 that approves Regulation on Free and Fair Competition for the Telecommunications Sector provides that Indotel will review, authorize, object or condition the operations related to economic concentration which must be previously informed pursuant to said Regulation, in order to comply with the purposes of Law 153-98. Indotel will also investigate and impose sanctions in the cases where the information obligation of the mentioned operations is not complied with. - Resolution No. 022-05 defines economic concentration in the telecommunications sector as a juridical transaction by means of which the structure of direct or indirect control, total or partial, of one or more providers of public telecommunications services is modified permanently and stably, for the benefit of persons that control other providers of public telecommunications services, whenever such transaction has the potential to modify the structure and functioning of the markets in the telecommunications sector in accordance with the purposes set forth in article 3 of Law No. 153-98. The providers of public telecommunications services, as well as any other persons subject to said Regulation must previously inform Indotel of all those operations that could result in an economic concentration in the telecommunications sector in the terms therein defined, in order to previously obtain the authorization of Indotel to do so. In addition to the obligations set forth in Resolution 036-19, relating to requirements for the authorization to transfer the rights or permits, the assessment to determine if there is any economic concentration in the telecommunications sector, will be based in its restrictive, predictable and verified effects, mainly considering certain circumstances set forth in Resolution No. 022-05. The failure to inform and/or apply for an authorization prior to an economic concentration operation in the telecommunications sector constitutes an infringement of Resolution No. 022-05 that will result in the sanctions set forth therein. Application for an authorization related to economic concentration must be filed pursuant to the provisions set forth in Chapter VIII of Resolution 036-19, before the Indotel and shall be reviewed by the Executive Direction of such institution. - Resolution No. 089-17, amended by Resolution 005-19 dated February 7, 2019, that approves the General Regulations for the Sharing of Passive Infrastructure and Related Telecommunications Facilities. - Resolution No. 038-11 dated May 12, 2011 that amends the General Ruling concerning Interconnection; ----- - Resolution No. 025-10 dated March 2, 2010, that approves the Ruling concerning Resolution of Controversies between the Telecommunications Services Providers; - Resolution No. 160-05 dated October 13, 2005, that approves the Regulation concerning Cable Broadcasts and Other Measures, including “Must Carry” provisions; - Resolution No. 151-04 that approves the Regulation concerning the Installation and Use of Common Telecommunications Infrastructures in Properties of Joint Ownership; - Resolution No. 128-04 that approves the General Regulation concerning the Use of the Radio Electric Spectrum; - Resolution No. 120-04 that approves the Regulation concerning Television Broadcasting Service; - Resolution No. 093-02 dated November 14, 2002, that amends several Articles of Resolution No. 045 02 that approved the Regulation concerning Sound Broadcasting Frequency Modulation (FM); and, - Resolution No. 046-02 dated July 20, 2002, that approves the Regulation concerning Sound Broadcasting Amplitude Modulation (AM).",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

We provide our television services pursuant to a non-exclusive general cable broadcasting license issued by the Broadcasting Council that applies to all areas of the State of Israel (the “Broadcasting Licenses”). The Broadcasting Licenses contain certain conditions and restrictions relating to the provision of cable television services to our customers, including among others, a requirement to extend our services to customers in all areas of Israel which, in some cases, creates an obligation on us to provide services even though it would not be worthwhile economically to do so. There are certain places in Israel in which we do not currently provide services. In November 2014, the Israeli Ministry of Communications issued an order requiring us to provide services in some of those areas.

According to the Bill, the purpose of the amendment is to change the regulation of the multi-channel TV market and adapt it to the technological changes, so that the regulation will apply to audio-visual content suppliers which carry contents to the public in Israel, as of a certain scope of income, while encouraging the competition and reducing the regulatory burden. According to the Bill, it is proposed that the regulation will apply on content providers under the principal of technological neutrality, i.e. it shall also apply with respect to content providers which carry their broadcasts over the internet, provided that such broadcasts are aimed primarily to the Israeli pubic. In addition, it is proposed to apply the regulation in a gradual manner, so that it will only apply to providers with a certain scope of activity. In addition, in order to unify the regulatory rules applicable to all license holders, it is proposed to cancel the cable broadcasting license and the satellite broadcasting license and the different regulation in this respect. Instead of that, it is proposed that any audio-visual content provider that meets the proposed conditions, regardless of the technology, will operate according to an audio-visual content license according to a unified regulatory framework. It is also proposed to update and adapt the Broadcasting Council’s authorities in a way that will reduce its authorities and focus them on subjects like broadcasting ethics, child protections and local production investments. It is further proposed to enable the license holders to offer their subscribers broadcasting packages upon their discretion, provided, however, that every channel will be also offered for purchase separately and not as part of a package. However, until the competition is established, it is proposed to maintain the existing regulation with respect to a narrow basic package and to authorize the Broadcasting Council to instruct a license holder to include in the basic package contents produced or purchased by it, in a rate that will be determined by the Council which shall not increase 20%. On October 7, 2020, a committee appointed by the Minister of Communications for the purpose of reviewing the macro-regulation in the broadcasting market published a public hearing regarding the future regulation in the broadcasting market in Israel.

Regarding some of the services, after hearing proceedings, service files were established regarding the service provision format. Also attached to the decision were regulations on maximum service rates on the Bezeq network. On June 15, 2017 HOT received the Minister of Communication’s decision to adopt the recommendations of the Ministry’s professional echelon on setting maximum rates for providing wholesale services on the HOT network for 2017-2018. In November 2018, the Ministry of Communications extended the maximum rates until 2020. In July 2019, the Ministry of Communications published a new proposal for setting the maximum rates for providing wholesale services. The decision also noted that the recommendations of the Ministry’s Engineering Department would be adopted, and that the Minister would instruct HOT to perform the required tests in order to test the required inputs needed to provide the multicast service, and that a directive on the test details, completed within 4 months of the instruction, shall be published in the near future. HOT currently provides wholesale services in accordance with the Minister’s decision to service providers. On December 30, 2019, the Ministry of Communications published a hearing proposing to change the method for the wholesale tariffs in HOT’s network from cost-based model to a “retail-minus” basis. In the scope of the Ministry’s decision in June 2020, to allow HOT to offer bundles including HOT Net’s ISP services, the Ministry also decided that HOT will provide its wholesale services in consideration for decreased fees which were voluntarily proposed by HOT, and therefore the Ministry did not proceed with the change of tariffs as proposed in the hearing. _Use of Passive Infrastructure_ On February 26, 2015, the Ministry of Communications published a resolution on the service file for access service to physical infrastructure, according to which the infrastructure owners (Bezeq and HOT) must allow service providers to use the passive infrastructure of the infrastructure owners (stems, dens, boxes and poles) starting August 1, 2015. Following this, pursuant to the 2017-2018 Arrangements Law, Section 5 of the Communications Law was amended, in such a manner so as to compel domestic operators to allow other domestic operators to use their passive infrastructure in such a manner so as to allow the other domestic operator to deploy cables or optical fibers through it or establish telecom facilities, in such a manner so as to allow the maintenance of the cables and facilities in question, in order to perform any telecom activity and provide any telecom service in accordance with the terms of the other domestic operator’s license (“Mutual Arrangement”). It was also decided that the Minister of Communications, with the consent of the Minister of Finance, shall set the maximum or minimum tariffs for the use of the passive Bezeq infrastructure by a domestic operator who does not hold a unique general license (currently HOT and IBC Israel). In January 2019, the Ministry of Communications published draft regulations. Until these regulations are passed, the maximum payment set for access to passive infrastructure in the Communications Regulations (Telecom and Broadcasts) (Use of Domestic Operator Public Telecom Network), 5765-2014 (the “Telecom and Broadcasts Communications Regulations”), prior to the application of the Arrangements Law shall apply. If a difference exists between the payments paid by HOT for the use of the passive infrastructure in question, and the payments set by the Minister, retroactive accounting shall take place as the case may be. It was also decided that HOT’s right to use the passive infrastructure of a different domestic operator would be postponed to October 1, 2017. According to draft regulations published by the Ministry of Communications on August 13, 2018, the Ministry considers to order that the rates for the use of Bezeq’s passive infrastructures by HOT will be the same as the rates set for the use by other license holders.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Although we extend our services to most of Israel, there are currently certain areas of the country where we do not provide these services and we had applied for exemptions from the terms of the Fixed Line Licenses. Pursuant to the Fixed Line Licenses we are also required to provide network access service to other license holders on reasonable commercial terms so as to enable them to provide services to their subscribers and we must also avoid preferential provision of network access to our affiliated companies, including with regard to payment terms and service availability. ----- On June 22, 2014, a report (the “Report”) was submitted to the Minister, by an Advisory Committee to the Minister in accordance with the Communication Regulations (Telecommunications and Broadcasts) (Advisory Committee), 5761-2011 (respectively, the “Committee” and “Regulations”) recommending the considerations that should be applied in relation to applications submitted by Bezeq and HOT for exemption or deferral of the obligation to extend service. Among other things, the Committee recommended that there should be no justification to delay or limit the provision of telecommunications services in any area nationwide on the basis of cost-benefit considerations. The Report concludes that cost-benefit considerations should be taken into account only for applications to specifically restrict or deny the provision of communications services to specific customers (an “Individual Application”), rather than for a specific area or number of requests from the same area (a “General Request”). The Committee also recommended that limitations on the provision of communication services through exemptions or deferrals should, as a rule, be done only temporarily and recommended a temporary exemption for a fixed period of 24 months. It also recommended license holders must report any change in the circumstances surrounding an application for which an exemption was approved, and if the circumstances upon which the exemption was based no longer exist the universal obligation upon the licensee will apply immediately and without delay. In addition, the Committee recommended certain timelines for the implementation of the universal service obligation in case of rejection of an application for exemption or deferral. The Committee further recommended the rejection of all existing applications made by HOT, except with regard to one specific application relating to a particular settlement for which it suggests a deferral for a period of 24 months, subject to the provision of an alternative solution by HOT. On November 13, 2014, the Minister of Communications published his decision to adopt the recommendations of the Committee. As part of that decision, the Minister accepted the Committee’s recommendations with respect to the rejection of all existing applications for deferral and/or exemption made by HOT (subject to the exception noted above). As a result, HOT is required to implement its universal service obligations with respect to the first stage of the deployment, in 60 local jurisdictions determined by the Minister, within 24 months from the date of the adoption of the Committee’s recommendations (November 13, 2016). As noted above, the prescribed pace of implementation of the obligations will be reviewed annually, taking into account any technological and regulatory changes. It was further decided that the Committee shall submit to the Minister of Communications a list of recommended local jurisdictions for the next deployment stage, if required in accordance with the then-available technological alternatives. The implementation of the decision that required HOT to complete deployment of its network by November 13, 2016, was postponed several times by the Minister of Telecommunications until July 30, 2019. In July 2019, an Advisory Committee recommended that HOT would be allowed to extend its services by alternative technology without the need for laying infrastructure. The Minister of Communications adopted these recommendations and HOT is currently providing services in some of these areas using alternative technology.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

In the call for public comments, the Ministry presents initial principles according to which it is considering formulating regulation aimed at providing a solution for the different issues, mainly: 1. Freedom of action for infrastructure owners and service providers in terms of the technology mix, subject to the principle of non-infringement of the services that a competitor can offer. 2. Provision of wholesale services by the infrastructure owner as set out in the service portfolios, with any technological advancement in parallel to provision thereof in the existing networks. 3. A reasonable wholesale payment for BSA services, in accordance with Section 17 of the Communications Law, under the following restrictions: (a) A cost based tariff and not retail minus. ----- (b) A uniform flat monthly tariff without a variable capacity allocation component. (c) The option of speed-based differential pricing will be weighed. (d) The existence of an effective margin squeeze prevention mechanism. (e) Quick implementation—the Ministry is considering, until completion of the up-to-date study of costs, to set the controlled price for fiber-based wholesale services, based on the data currently in its possession. It was indicated that a specific hearing on the subject would be published further to the call for public comments. 4. Formulation of an incentive mechanism for operation of advanced networks (a) The universal service obligation will not apply to HOT in respect of advanced fiber-based networks. (b) Bezeq and HOT will be given flexibility to establish a plan for operation of the network on a regional level (cities/neighborhoods). The regions in which the infrastructure owner intends to operate a fiber network will be published for the service providers several months in advance. In case of barriers to implementation of use of this service, the Ministry will act to remove them. On February 10, 2019 an inter-ministerial team was established to review the policy for deployment of ultra-wide bandwidth fixed communication infrastructure in Israel that includes representatives from the Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Finance and the Competition Authority. The team was requested to review and formulate recommendations on the following subjects with attention to the good of the public and development of competition in the segment, all with respect to fixed ultra-wide bandwidth infrastructure: (i) Revision of the deployment obligations and/or obligations to provide the service applicable to the infrastructure owners and (ii) the need for tools to encourage deployment in regions in which it recommends stipulating that there is no deployment obligation, based on economic feasibility studies. On November 5, 2019, the team published its recommendations for the next deployment stage to public's comments. The principal recommendations of the team are as follows: (i) Bezeq will be entitled to choose the areas for the deployment of optical fibers network, in which it will be obligated to complete its deployment within five years; (ii) in order to finance the deployment of fiber-optic networks in the areas that Bezeq will decide not to do so (the “Incentivisation Areas”), a fund will be established to provide financial incentives for fibers deployment to the residents in those areas (the “Universal Fund”), which will allocate its funds by way of competitive procedures with minimum governmental intervention. The winning proposals in such procedures will be the lowest ones; (iii) the Universal Fund will be financed by annual payments of all license holders (including Bezeq) in the amount of 0.5% of their annual income; and (iv) in order to motivate Bezeq to commit to a broad deployment, to limit the Incentivisation Areas, to decrease the deployment costs in such areas and to create a high level of competition in them, the team recommends: (a) to limit Bezeq’s deployment in the Incentivisation Areas, (b) to exclude Bezeq from participating in the bidding process for the allocation of the Universal Fund sources; (c) that the cost for the use of Bezeq’s physical infrastructures by other operators will be based on a different method, significantly lower than the payments in accordance with the wholesale market regulation; (d) the winning bidder(s) in a specific area will be obligated to provide wholesale BSA services in this area to other license holders. The team mentioned in its recommendation, that the examination of HOT’s deployment obligation should be further explored in the scope of another opinion, in accordance with the developments in HOT’s network and in order to adapt its deployment obligation to the advantages of its network and to the scope of deployment of its passive network. Following the call for public comments and the appointment of the inter-ministerial team, the Ministry of Communications published several additional hearings regarding various subjects related to the policy and regulation of deployment of advanced networks in Israel. Following these procedures, on July 20, 2020, the Minister of Communications decided to adopt the recommendations of the inter-ministerial team regarding the deployment obligations that will apply to the infrastructure owners, subject to several changes. In this scope, it was decided that Bezeq will be entitled to choose the areas for deployment and operation of its advanced network within five years, according to timelines which will be set in Bezeq’s license. In the event that HOT decides to deploy an advanced network, it will be obligated to deploy at least 30% and to meet a 1:1 proportion rate between ----- the center and peripheral areas. Bezeq also notified the Ministry of certain areas in which it will not deploy any network (the “Incentive Areas”). In order to promote the deployment in the Incentive Areas, a fund will be founded that will grant financial incentives for the deployment of competitive procedures (the “Fund”) and Bezeq will not be entitled to participate in such procedures. The financing of the Fund will be done through annual payments by the license holders (including Bezeq) which have an infrastructure or a marketing relation (as such terms are defined in the report) in an amount equal to 0.5% of their respective annual income. The payments to the Fund will begin in 2021 based on the annual incomes of 2020. It was further decided that the cost for the use of Bezeq’s physical infrastructures in the Incentive Areas will be significantly lower than the wholesale market tariffs and that the front-runners of the competitive procedures will be obligated to provide wholesale services (BSA) in the Incentive Areas to other license holders. In September 2020, the Israeli government approved the fiber optic program and following that, in December 2020, the Communication Law was amended in order to implement the decisions of the MOC and the government regarding the policy for deployment in accordance with the principals described above, subject to several changes. It was decided that Bezeq will be obligated to complete the deployment in the areas chosen by it within six years and that it shall notify the Ministry of Communications within five months from January 1, 2020 (which may be extended by up to two months) regarding the areas for deployment. The Ministry of Communications’ General Director will notify the license holders that are required to make payments towards the Fund, the amount owed by them for the applicable year by July 1 of each year.

The hearing and the secondary hearing are intended to arrange the examination on whether owners of nationally-deployed infrastructure (Bezeq and HOT) are using margin squeeze practices in order to push service providers lacking national land-based infrastructure out of the market. This by lowering retail process and reducing the margin between the retail prices of an infrastructure owner and the retail price of the infrastructure input purchased by service providers.

To the best of our knowledge, Bezeq marketed several communication packages. According to publications, in 2018 Bezeq’s subsidiaries – Bezeq International, Yes and Pelephone – strengthened their synergies and announced that they would be cooperating, including by offering joint service packages. In June 2018, a dedicated team was appointed in the Ministry of Communications to review the need to update the structural separation obligations of Bezeq and HOT. In February 2019, Bezeq filed a petition to the High Court of Justice demanding to cancel the structural separation between it and its subsidiaries. On June 30, 2020, the inter-division team appointed by the Ministry of Communications in June 2018 for the purpose of review of the need to update the structural separation in Bezeq and HOT, published its recommendations. The team recommended that the structural separation should not be canceled, however, the Minister of Communications will later examine the need to change the separation between internet infrastructure service and ISP service. Following that, in October 2020, the Ministry of Communications published a hearing proposing to amend Bezeq and HOT’s licenses so that as of January 1, 2022 they will be entitled to provide their customers a unified internet service. In February 2021, the Ministry of Communications published a secondary hearing in this matter, proposing certain changes to the previous hearing. As of the date hereof, no decision has been made in this hearing.

On August 27, 2013, the ----- Minister of Communications issued a general license for the provision of domestic land-based telecom services (infrastructure) to IBC Israel. In August 2018, the Minister of Communications decided to amend the regulatory framework for the operation of IBC Israel, in a way that shall enable the reduction of its universal deployment obligation. Following that, it was decided that the new license that will be granted to IBC Israel will include a deployment obligation for 40% of the households in Israel within 10 years. In addition, it was decided that the Minister may allow a domestic fixedline operator (except Bezeq or HOT) to be the control owner in IBC Israel, if he was convinced that this would not affect the competition or the public interest. In March 2019, Cellcom signed an agreement to purchase (together with Israel Infrastructure Fund (“IIF”)) 70% of the share capital of IBC Israel and in August 2019 the Minister of Communications granted a new license to IBC Israel. Following the Ministry of Communications’ approval, it was reported that such transaction was completed in July 2019. In September 2020, HOT entered into an investment agreement with the partnership holding 70% share capital of IBC Israel, so that after the completion of the transaction HOT holds the partnership together with Cellcom and IIF and holds approximately 23.3% of IBC Israel.

1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,295,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE GROUP,295.199,Mobile,295.199.2,Construction of Network Sites,"The regulation of network site construction and operation are primarily set forth in the Israeli National Zoning Plan 36A for Communications which was published in May 2002 (“National Zoning Plan 36”). The construction of radio access devices, which are cell sites of smaller dimensions, is further regulated in the Planning and Building Law and the Communications Law. _National Zoning Plan 36A_ National Zoning Plan 36A (the “Plan”) includes guidelines for constructing cell sites in order to provide mobile broadcasting and reception communications coverage throughout Israel, while preventing radiation hazards and minimizing damage to the environment and landscape. Plan sets forth the considerations that the planning and building authorities should take into account when issuing building permits for cell sites. These considerations include the satisfaction of safety standards meant to protect the public’s health from non-ionizing radiation emitting from cell sites, minimizing damage to the landscape and examining the effects of cell sites on their physical surroundings. However, the Plan is in the process of being revised. Current proposed changes will impose additional restrictions and requirements on the construction and operation of cell sites. On June 1, 2010, the National Council for Planning and Building approved the National Zoning Plan No. 36/A/1 version that incorporates all of the amendments to the Plan (the “Amended Plan”). The main amendments to the Plan are: (a) the Amended Plan provides for full liability for depreciated property claims on the mobile operators; (b) the Amended Plan prohibits the erection of poles in urban areas (excluding industrial zones) and in rural areas (excluding next to existing infrastructure); (c) the Amended Plan grants to the municipalities the authority to approve local zoning plans that will regulate the deployment of site; and (d) the Amended Plan demands a minimum distance of four meters between antenna poles on a rooftop. The Amended Plan is subject to governmental approval, in accordance with the Planning and Building Law. It is unknown if, and when, the government intends to approve the Amended Plan. If the Amended Plan is approved, it may have a significant impact on our ability to get permits for our mobile sites. In addition, we may need to change the location of our future mobile network sites to less suitable locations, which may have an adverse effect on the quality and capacity of our mobile network coverage. The cost of complying with the Amended Plan might be substantial and may adversely affect our revenues and profits. The Amended Plan has not yet received the required approval. _Radio Access Devices_ Most mobile operators have historically relied on an exemption from obtaining a building permit under the Construction and Planning Law for constructing rooftop mobile radio access devices, which was consistent with the Israeli Attorney General opinion on the matter. In September 2010, the Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction that forbid the continued construction of access facilities in cellular basis on the basis of an exemption from building permits (requested in two petitions filed in July 2008 and June 2009). The temporary injunction, issued at the request of the Attorney General, will remain in effect until the proposed regulations are passed or the court decides otherwise. In his announcement, the Attorney General noted that when the winners are declared for the frequency tender in which HOT Mobile took part and won, he may ask that the injunction be reduced. The injunction will not apply to the replacement of existing access facilities under certain circumstances. In September 2010, the Court issued a temporary injunction on the petitions. As part of its response to the petition, the Sate responded that he reduction in the scope of the order regarding the new operators shall be in effect until June 30 2014, and that after that date the sole opportunity for establishing access facilities will be after approving the relevant regulations, and in accordance with the restrictions set therein. In September 2014, a hearing was held ----- on the petitions before the Court, with no ruling yet received. In March 2016, the Court updated the ordinance in such a manner that allows HOT Mobile and Partner to unify both companies access facilities in the joint network and as part of this, move the location of some of the facilities. In December 2017, a discussion was held at the Knesset Economics Committee (the “Economics Committee”) on the new wording of regulations issued by the Minister of Finance in coordination with the other relevant government ministries. The Economics Committee did not finish its discussion of all of the items, and therefore made clear that a follow-up meeting would be set for the regulations. The proposed wording was recommended by the National Council of Planning and Construction. Inasmuch as the wording is approved in the format sent to the Economics Committee, this will make it very difficult to move wireless access facilities from one place to another as well as make changes to existing access facilities. Radio access devices also require permits from the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection. The local planning and building committee’s engineer may object to the exemption for a permit requirement prior to installing radio access devices. An annulment of, or inability to rely on, or substantial limitation of, the exemption could adversely affect our existing network and network build out (particularly given the objection of some local planning and building authorities to grant due permits where required), could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain environmental permits for these sites, could negatively affect the extent, quality, capacity and coverage of our network and have a negative impact on our ability to continue to market our mobile services effectively. _The Non-Ionising Radiation Law_ In accordance with the provisions of the Non-Ionizing Radiation Law and the amendment to the Planning and Construction Law, which among other things establish a requirement to deposit a letter of indemnification from suits for the loss of value of real estate as a condition for receiving a permit to build a broadcast facility. According to the National Council for Planning and Construction’s guidelines, a 100% indemnity obligation was established. After the law was passed, as of December 31, 2016, HOT Mobile has submitted 346 letters of indemnity as a condition for the receipt of building licenses at various sites around the country. As of this date, no claims have been filed against the group by virtue of the letters of indemnity and according to the announcement of the Attorney General, claims by virtue of the letters of indemnification filed one year after receiving the building permit will not be recognized. Note that to date, a partial version of the regulations has been ratified, and the chapter of the regulations pertaining to maximum radiation levels has yet to be completed. A version of the chapter in question approved by the Minister of Communications has been filed by the Ministry of the Environment, for the approval of the Knesset Interior and Environmental Committee, but did not secure its approval, as the Committee requested stricter criteria for permits issued by the environmental radiation supervisor. If the Committee’s requests are accepted, HOT Mobile estimates that it may have a material impact on its ability to provide cellular services in the State of Israel.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The Communications Law was amended in July 2009 to provide for MVNO licenses, and, in January 2010, the regulations necessary for the granting of an MVNO license were promulgated. The regulations regulate the operation of an MVNO pursuant to an agreement to be reached and entered between a mobile operator and an MVNO and sets, among others, the conditions for receiving an MVNO license, including a requirement to operate a mobile phone switch, a restriction on a mobile operator and a fixed line operator to receive an MVNO license and limitations on parties related to an existing mobile operator and on other communication licensees to receive an MVNO license. The amendment ----- provides that in the event that an, MVNO and mobile operator will not have reached an agreement as to the provision of service by way of MVNO within six months from the date the MVNO has approached the mobile operator, and if the Ministry together with the Israeli Ministry of Finance determine that the failure to reach an agreement is due to unreasonable conditions imposed by the mobile operator, the Ministry will use its authority to provide instructions. Such instructions may include intervening in the terms of the agreement, including by setting the price of the service.

HOT began operating on January 1, 2004, and since the completion of the merger, it has coordinated all of the Company’s communications activity. As stated, as part of the policy of the Ministry of Communications for increasing competition in the communications market, provisions were stipulated in the domestic operator license regarding structural separation between the broadcasting license holder and the domestic operator license holder. In accordance with the domestic operator license and the broadcasting license provisions, regarding structural separation between the Company and HOT, they are permitted to work together in offering joint product packages, which include multi-channel television services, telephony services and internet infrastructure access services. In accordance with the provisions of the Licenses, the Group uses for its activity, various restrictions are placed on the activity of group companies, which prevent full synergy in the Group’s activity, including the requirement for separate managements at some of the companies.

We are also subject to the Planning and Construction Act and regulations with regard to site construction, the Consumer Protection Law, 5741-1981, the Non Ionising Radiation Law, 5766-2006, and the Law for the Prevention of Environmental Hazards (Civil Claims), 5752-1992, which enables class action claims in cases of radiation contamination. We provide our mobile services pursuant to a non exclusive license to erect, maintain and operate a mobile system and to provide mobile services (the “Mobile License”). The Mobile License was amended in September 2011 to add additional frequencies in relation to the creation of a UMTS network. The Mobile License with respect to the main original frequencies which we use to deliver our iDEN-based mobile services is valid until February 2016. Over the course of 2016 HOT Mobile has launched a new service, “MIRS4G”, based on POC technology (PTT over cellular) on its network, to replace the service the Company had provided on the iDEN network. The Mobile License with respect to the additional frequencies which we will utilize to provide UMTS-based mobile services is valid until September 2031. The Mobile License may be extended for periods of six years at a time upon approval by the Israeli Ministry of Communications. As a general rule, the Mobile License is non transferable, and the transfer of any means of control in a relevant license holder is subject to prior approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications. Certain key features of the regulations and licenses governing our mobile operations, including certain proposed regulatory changes that may have a significant impact on our operations, are set forth below. On July 2, 2014, the Israeli Ministry of Communications published a tender for a mobile phone license for the provision of advanced services using 4G-LTE technology, through which a total of eight frequency bands in the area of 1,800 MHz will be allocated (with a width of 5 MHz). On November 18, 2014, HOT Mobile submitted its offer in response to the tender. The draft tender clarified that a licensee may enter into a network sharing agreement with another licensee subject to certain conditions. As a result, HOT Mobile has updated its request for approval by the Israeli Ministry of Communications of the Joint Network Agreement with Partner accordingly. In connection with this tender process, the Israeli Ministry of Communications announced its decision to allow all existing mobile operators wishing to upgrade their systems immediately to use the frequency bandwidth of 5 MHz (X2) in the area of 1,800 MHz LTE technology. If the operator does not currently have such an allocation, the Israeli Ministry of Communications will assign them a temporary frequency bandwidth to use LTE technology until the end of the tender proceedings. However, companies will be required to avoid discrimination between operators that are being hosted on their networks, such as virtual operators or operators with domestic roaming agreements, in terms of the level of technology offered to their subscribers. In addition, companies will not be able to discriminate between subscribers with regards to the price of services, and will not be able to charge an additional cost for these 4G services, until such time as the launch of LTE after the publication of the tender winners and receiving their revised frequencies license. Companies may also not raise fares in light of this upgrade to customers, virtual operators or users of domestic roaming. During July and August 2014, Partner Communications Ltd., Cellcom Israel Ltd. and Pelephone Communications Ltd., announced the launch of LTE. HOT Mobile intends to launch such services in the coming months. The outcome of the 4G-LTE tender process was announced during 2015. In July 2018, the Ministry of Communications temporarily allocated two bands, each of 5 MHz, in the 700 MHz spectrum, to HOT Mobile and Partner. According to the announcement by the Ministry on May 17, 2018, these temporary allocations were intended to enable technological preparations for providing advanced services and for efficient assimilation of the relevant technologies via this frequency. In view of the network sharing agreement between HOT Mobile and Partner, it was decided that Partner will also be allowed to use the frequencies allocated to HOT Mobile using the shared network (see below). In June 2019, the Ministry of Communications published a tender for 5G frequencies, which defers the first payment on the bands until 2022, in order to enable the companies to direct their financial resources to investments during first two years. The temporary allocation will be canceled based on the results of the tender. In accordance with the tender conditions, HOT Mobile and Partner submitted a joint proposal and won, each, the following frequencies: 10 MHz in the 700 MHz frequency range, 20 MHz in the 2,600 MHz frequency range and 50 MHz in the 3,500 MHz frequency range. The frequencies were allocated to HOT Mobile in September 9, 2020, and in that day HOT Mobile also received an amended license allowing it to operate a 5G network. Upon the receipt of the amended license and the frequencies allocation, HOT Mobile began to operate a 5G network. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

With respect to the one-time bonus of Pierre Chappaz, Teads will gross up the one-time bonus for all Dutch income taxes that will become due by him and all Dutch wage withholding taxes to be withheld by Teads on his behalf in connection with this bonus. Based on the Dutch maximum statutory progressive income and wage tax rate of 49.50%, the total amount to be paid by Teads in respect of Pierre Chappaz may be up to $41 million. Teads and Pierre Chappaz will file an application with the Dutch Revenue Service for the purpose of designating 30% of the appointment bonus as tax-exempt wages, which, if granted, may reduce the total amount of the cost with respect to the one-time bonus of Pierre Chappaz to no more than $35 million.

The pledge agreements and the other security documents, as amended and/or restated, modified or replaced from time to time, in respect of the Notes Collateral are referred to as the “Security Documents”. Any other additional security interests that may in the future be granted to secure the obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute Notes Collateral. Other than pursuant to the HOT Proceeds Note, Altice International has only a shareholder’s claim over the assets of HOT and its Subsidiaries, which are junior to the claims that creditors of HOT and its Subsidiaries have against HOT and such Subsidiaries. Holders of the Notes will only be creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors and will not have any direct claim on the cash flows or assets of HOT and its Subsidiaries, and none of HOT and its Subsidiaries will have any obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes or the Note Guarantees or to make funds available to the Issuer or the Guarantors for those payments (other than their respective obligations to pay certain amounts due to the Issuer under the HOT Proceeds Note). The assets of Altice Portugal, PT Portugal and PT OpCo will secure the Notes subject to the applicable Aggregate Portuguese Security and Guarantee Limit Amount.

Accordingly, the Notes Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to release the security interests in some of the Notes Collateral, by reference to the interests of other creditors. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the Notes Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation.

Holders of the Notes will only be able to seek remedies against the HOT Proceeds Note Obligors in the event of an event of default under the applicable HOT Proceeds Note, in each case, indirectly as a result of the assignment of the applicable HOT Proceeds Note and/or the ability of the holders of the Notes to direct the actions of the Issuer in connection with the applicable HOT Proceeds Note in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent permitted thereby.

Whenever in the Indenture or in this “Description of Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, and any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, _mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes (and any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having power to tax) and any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of such Person on the Notes or any Note Guarantee and any political subdivision thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

No such purchase in part shall reduce the principal amount at maturity of the Dollar Notes held by any holder to below $200,000 or the Euro Notes held by any holder to below €100,000. Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional _Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is_ 60 days after any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Issuer’s option, at any time prior to a Change of Control Triggering Event following the public announcement thereof or if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control, the Issuer will send a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes by mail or otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days from the date such notice is mailed nor later than the later of 60 days from the date such notice is mailed and 60 days after the Change of Control Triggering Event) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) and the record date; (3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; ----- (4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event; (5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; (6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event; and (7) certain other procedures that a holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and admitted for trading on the Exchange and the rules and regulations of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any Change of Control Offer as required by such rules. The ability of the Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the _Notes and the Structure—We may not be able to obtain enough funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) as required by the Indenture”._ On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the relevant Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the U.S. Paying Agent (in the case of the Dollar Global Notes) or to the Euro Paying Agent (in the case of the Euro Global Notes) the applicable Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agents, at the Issuer’s expense, will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly instruct its authenticating agent to authenticate and, at the Issuer’s expense, mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Dollar Notes, and €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Euro Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice with respect to the results of the Change of Control Offer as required by such rules. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party from seeking to acquire Altice International or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the ----- requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The provisions of the Indenture will not afford holders of the Notes the right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, certain transactions with Altice International’s management or its Affiliates or certain other sale transactions, including a takeover, reorganization, recapitalization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction (including, in certain circumstances, an acquisition of Altice International by management or its Affiliates) involving the Issuer that may adversely affect holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control Triggering Event. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The existing indebtedness of the Issuer, Altice International or the Restricted Subsidiaries contains, and its respective future indebtedness may also contain, prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a “change of control” thereunder or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon such a change of control (and such change of control may not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture). Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by Altice International’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—We may _not be able to obtain enough funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) as required by the Indenture”._ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of Altice International and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to a Person (including any “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act)), other than a Permitted Holder. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

provided that: (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary;

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: (1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; (2) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; (3) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (8), (14) or (16) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; (4) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; ----- (5) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and (6) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, or at the option of the Issuer, the date first committed; _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable eurodenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus any additional amount to pay premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection therewith; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a currency other than euro is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal amount and interest payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, will be the Euro Equivalent of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency Agreement plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement. For purposes of determining compliance with the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, or at the option of the Issuer, the date first committed; _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other_ than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus any amount to pay premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection therewith; and (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio to test compliance with any covenant in the Indenture, in determining the amount of Indebtedness outstanding in euro on any date of determination, with respect to any Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro (the “Foreign Currency”): (1) subject to a currency swap arrangement or contract, the aggregate principal amount of such Foreign Currency Indebtedness on any such date of determination shall be the euro amount of the aggregate principal amount to be paid by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary on the maturity date of such currency swap arrangement or contract pursuant to the terms thereof; or ----- (2) subject to a currency forward arrangement, forward accretion curve or contract, the aggregate principal amount of such Foreign Currency Indebtedness shall be converted into euro at the exchange rate specified under the terms of such currency forward arrangement, forward accretion curve or contract as applicable to such Foreign Currency Indebtedness on such date of determination. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding a Group member entering into any such arrangement or contract hedging foreign exchange exposure of any Foreign Currency Indebtedness, for the purposes of calculating the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness subject to any such arrangement or contract shall be attributed to the total Indebtedness of the Person that originally Incurred such Indebtedness. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness (including any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the second paragraph of this covenant) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Note Guarantee on substantially identical terms (as determined in good faith by the Issuer); _provided,_ _however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured, by virtue of being secured with different collateral, by virtue of not being guaranteed by one or more of Altice International’s Subsidiaries, by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment-ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

(ii) unless included in clause (a)(i), to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor that is secured in whole or in part by a Lien on the Notes Collateral (including by virtue of the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement), which Lien ranks _pari _passu with the Liens securing the Notes, at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount_ of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; provided that the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, shall prepay, redeem, repay or repurchase Pari Passu Indebtedness that is Public Debt pursuant to this clause (ii) only if the Issuer or such Guarantor purchases through open market purchases at a price equal to or higher than 100% of the principal amount thereof, or makes an offer to the holders of the Notes to purchase their Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) for, in each case, an aggregate principal amount of Notes at least equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum of the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Pari Passu Indebtedness;

provided, however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of Altice International that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment or commitment to invest is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day; (c) to make a capital expenditure within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such capital expenditure made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of Altice International that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day;

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”. On the 366th day (or the 546th day, in the case of any Net Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or commitment approved by the Board of Directors of Altice International pursuant to clauses (b) or (c) of the second paragraph of this covenant) after the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €100 million, the Issuer will be required within ten (10) Business Days thereof to make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all holders of Notes and, to the extent the Issuer or a Guarantor elects or the Issuer or a Guarantor is required by the terms of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders of such other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and (i) in the case of the Dollar Notes, in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and (ii) in the case of the Euro Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. No such purchase in part shall reduce the principal amount at maturity of the Notes held by any holder to below $200,000 in the case of the Dollar Notes and to below €100,000 in the case of the Euro Notes. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to such Net Available Cash prior to the time period that may be required by the Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Net Available Cash (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”). To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), Altice International and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use any remaining Excess ----- Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for general corporate purposes, to the extent not prohibited by the other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euros, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero, and in the case of an Advance Offer, the amount of Net Available Cash the Issuer is offering to apply in such Advance Offer shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency. The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement or such shorter period of time required to comply with Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations in connection with the Asset Disposition Offer (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five (5) Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a _pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness_ or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and, (i) in the case of the Dollar Notes, in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and (ii) in the case of Euro Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agents, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five (5) Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Notes an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee, upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will, via an authenticating agent, authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of $200,000 in the case of the Dollar Notes, and €100,000, in the case of the Euro Notes of a series. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book-entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee (or other extinguishment in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Dispositions) of Indebtedness and any other liabilities (as recorded on the balance sheet of Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary or in the footnotes thereto, or if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on Altice International’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or in the footnotes thereof if such incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith Altice International) of Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of Altice International or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; ----- (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by Altice International or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition to the extent of the cash received; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that Altice International and each other Restricted Subsidiary (as applicable) are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of €400 million and 25% of L2QA Pro Forma EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received or, at the option of Altice International, at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition, and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee is aware, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability.

Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. With respect to any Default or Event of Default, the words “exists,” “is continuing” or similar expressions with respect thereto shall mean that the Default or Event of Default has occurred and has not yet been cured or waived. If any Default or Event of Default occurs due to (a) the failure by any person to take any action by a specified time, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have been cured at the time, if any, that the applicable person takes such action or (b) the taking of any action by any person that is not then permitted by the terms of the Indenture or any other Notes Document, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to be cured on the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which such action would be permitted at such time to be taken under the Indenture and the other Notes Documents and (ii) the date on which such action is unwound or otherwise modified to the extent necessary for such revised action to be permitted at such time by the Indenture and the other Notes Documents. If any Default or Event of Default occurs that is subsequently cured (a “Cured Default”), any other subsequent Default or Event of Default resulting from the taking or omitting to take any action by any person, ----- which subsequent Default or Event of Default would not have arisen had the Cured Default not occurred, shall be deemed to be cured automatically upon, and simultaneously with, the cure of the Cured Default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, a Default or Event of Default (the “Initial Default”) may not be cured pursuant to this paragraph: (a) in the case of an Initial Default described in clause (b) of the second sentence of this paragraph, if an Officer of the Issuer had Knowledge at the time of taking any such action that such Initial Default had occurred and was continuing; or (b) if the Trustee shall have declared all the Notes to be due and payable immediately pursuant to the provisions described under “Events of Default” prior to the date such Initial Default would have been deemed to be cured under this paragraph. For purposes of the paragraph above, “Knowledge” shall mean, with respect to an Officer of the Issuer, (i) the actual knowledge of such individual or (ii) the knowledge that such individual would have obtained if such individual had acted in good faith to discharge his or her duties with the same level of diligence and care as would reasonably be expected from an officer in a substantially similar position. Without limiting the foregoing, the Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with an Initial Default then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Notes will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) to its satisfaction.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors”.

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes and the closing of the offering (the “40-day Period”), beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated in the same currency only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions. After the expiration of the 40-day Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated in the same currency without compliance with these certification requirements. Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A (if available). Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors”, Book-Entry Interests may be transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of Notes—Transfer and Exchange”. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the firstmentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as described under “Description of Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors”. This paragraph refers to transfers and exchanges with respect to Dollar Global Notes only. Transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for 144A Book-Entry Interest in a Dollar Global Note will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originating from the Trustee through the DTC Deposit/Withdrawal Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the corresponding 144A Global Note. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of unrestricted Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a BookEntry Interest.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Registrars and the Transfer Agents nor the Initial Purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised the Issuer that it is: ----- - a limited purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law, - a “banking organization” within the meaning of New York Banking Law, - a member of the Federal Reserve System, - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and - a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provision of Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. Like DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic bookentry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and/or Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear and/or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Global Notes, cross market transfers between participants in DTC, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be done through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of each of Euroclear or Clearstream by its common depositary, however, such cross market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and regulations and within the established deadlines of such system (Brussels time). Euroclear or Clearstream will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the common depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the Global Notes by DTC, and making and receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement application to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the common depositary. Because of the time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be ----- a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received in Euroclear and Clearstream as a result of a sale of an interest in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a participant in DTC, will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC, but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

Moreover, this description does not address the 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income, the U.S. federal estate and gift tax or the alternative minimum tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Notes and does not address the U.S. federal income tax treatment of holders that do not acquire the Notes as part of the initial offering at their initial issue price (generally, in each case, the first price to the public at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money). Each prospective purchaser should consult its own tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of the Notes.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of the partnership and a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

The Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. Holder unless such holder discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations. The IRS, however, may take a position contrary to the Issuer’s position, which could affect the amount, timing and character of a U.S. Holder’s income with respect to the Notes. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof.

1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,96,FATCA,96.3,Stated Interest,96.3.1,,"Stated interest paid on the Notes generally will be treated as “qualified stated interest”. Payments of qualified stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as detailed below. The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the Issuer), or that is treated as constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate. Stated interest on the Euro Notes will be included in a U.S. Holder’s gross income in an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euros, including the amount of any withholding tax thereon, regardless of whether the euros are converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting will determine such U.S. dollar value using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt. A cash method U.S. Holder generally will not realize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of the interest payment but may have foreign currency gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros received. Generally, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will determine the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest income using the average rate of exchange for the accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within each taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period) or the spot rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of an interest payment if the exchange rate in effect on the date the payment is received differs from the rate used in translating the accrual of that interest. The amount of foreign currency gain or loss to be recognized by such U.S. Holder will be an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (determined on the basis of the spot rate on the date the interest income is received) in respect of the accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has accrued during the accrual period (as determined above) regardless of whether the payment is converted to U.S. dollars. This foreign currency gain or loss will be ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Foreign currency gain or loss generally will be U.S. source ----- provided that the residence of a taxpayer is considered to be the United States for purposes of the rules regarding foreign currency gain or loss. Interest (including OID, if any, as described below) included in a U.S. Holder’s gross income with respect to the Notes will be treated as foreign source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The limitation on non-U.S. taxes eligible for the U.S. foreign tax credit is calculated separately with respect to specific “baskets” of income. For this purpose, interest generally should constitute “passive category income”. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to the U.S. Holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,96,FATCA,96.4,Original Issue Discount,96.4.1,,"One or more series of the Notes may be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A Note will be treated as having been issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes if its “stated redemption price at maturity” exceeds its issue price by at least the “OID de minimis amount”. The OID de minimis amount equals 1/4 of 1% of the debt instrument’s stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years from its issue date to maturity. The “stated redemption price at maturity” of a Note is the sum of all payments required to be made on the Note other than qualified stated interest payments. If a Note is issued with OID, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income before the receipt of the associated cash payment, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s accounting method for tax purposes. The amount of OID with respect to a Note that a U.S. Holder must include in income is the sum of the “daily portions” of the OID for the Note for each day during the taxable year (or portion of the taxable year) in which the U.S. Holder held the Note. The daily portion is determined by allocating a pro rata portion of the OID for each day of the accrual period. An accrual period may be of any length and the accrual periods may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first day of an accrual period or on the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period is equal to the excess of (1) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the Note at the beginning of the accrual period and its yield to maturity (computed on a constant yield method and compounded at the end of each accrual period, taking into account the length of the particular accrual period) over (2) the amount of any stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Note at the beginning of any accrual period is generally the sum of the issue price of the Note plus the amount of OID allocable to all prior accrual periods reduced by any payments on the Note that were not stated interest. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. Under these rules, a U.S. Holder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) and the “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of the period. Under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, a U.S. Holder of a Note with OID may elect to include in gross income all interest (including stated interest) that accrues on the Note using the constant yield method described above. Once made with respect to the Note, the election cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder considering an election under these rules should consult its own tax advisor. U.S. Holders may obtain information regarding the amount of OID, if any, the issue price, the issue date and yield to maturity by contacting the Issuer, 5, Rue Eugène Ruppert, L-2453 Luxembourg, Attn: Chief Financial Officer. Any OID on a Euro Note generally will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated into U.S. dollars in the same manner as stated interest accrued by an accrual basis U.S. Holder. Upon receipt of an amount attributable to OID (whether in connection with a sale or disposition of such a Note or otherwise), a U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign currency gain or loss in an amount determined in the same manner as stated interest received by an accrual basis U.S. Holder, as described above. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the interplay between the application of the OID and foreign currency exchange gain or loss rules. For these purposes, all receipts on a Euro Note will be viewed first, as payments of stated interest payable on the Note; second, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earlier accrual periods first; and, third, as receipts of principal. The rules regarding OID are complex. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules to their particular situations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be its U.S. dollar cost increased by the amount of any OID previously included in income and decreased by payments other than stated interest made with respect to the Note. If a U.S. Holder purchases a Note with euros, the U.S. dollar cost of the Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price on the date of purchase calculated at the spot rate of exchange on that date. The amount realized upon the disposition of a Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the amount received on the date of the disposition calculated at the spot rate of exchange on that date. However, if the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder (and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder) should determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of or amount received on the Note, as applicable, by translating the amount paid or received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or disposition, as applicable. The election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in respect of the purchase and disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable disposition of a Note will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than one year as of the date of disposition. Long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder generally is taxed at preferential rates. The ability of a U.S. Holder to offset capital losses against ordinary income is limited. Any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be treated as income from sources within the United States or loss allocable to income from sources within the United States. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period in which the U.S. Holder held such Note. Such foreign currency gain or loss will equal the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Euro Note calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Euro Note calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase of the Note.

The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation that a debtor has its center of main interests in the EU Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary, Preamble 30 of the Insolvency Regulation states that the center of main interests of a “debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis, which is therefore ascertainable by third parties”. The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the center of main interests of a debtor, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s center of main interests is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If the center of main interests of a debtor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one EU Member State under the Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another EU Member State. If the center of main interests of a debtor is in an EU Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other EU Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean a place of operations where the debtor carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods. Where main proceedings have been commenced in the EU Member State in which the debtor has its center of main interests, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another EU Member State in which the debtor has an establishment (secondary proceedings) are limited to “winding up proceedings” listed in Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other EU Member State. Where main proceedings in the EU Member State in which the debtor has its center of main interests have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another EU Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the EU Member State in which the debtor’s center of main interests is situated under that EU Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of a creditor which is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the other EU Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all EU Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other EU Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in an EU Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s center of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that EU Member State in another EU Member State (such ----- as to remove assets of the debtor from that other EU Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other EU Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other EU Member State where the debtor has assets. Following the entry into force of the Insolvency Regulation, there is an increased scrutiny in situations where there has been a recent COMI shift. Where a company’s COMI has shifted in the preceding three months the rebuttable presumption that its COMI is at the place of its registered office will no longer apply. Also, the opening of secondary proceedings in another EU Member State - which will no longer be limited only to “winding-up proceedings”—will be possible not only if the debtor has an establishment in such EU Member State at the time of the opening of main insolvency proceedings, but also if the debtor had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three-month period prior to the request of opening of main insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Subject to any specific provision in a company’s organizational documents, a grant of security or a guarantee by an Israeli company would generally require the approval of its board of directors, absent the existence of any interested party transactions.

A fixed charge is the charge of a certain asset as a security until the debt secured by the charge is settled. A floating charge is a charge over all or an unspecified part of the assets of a company, including its future assets. Unless otherwise specifically stated, a floating charge would include all of a pledging company’s assets that by their nature may change from time to time in accordance with the company’s business and the nature of its operations. Generally and unless otherwise restricted pursuant to the debenture under which it is created, a floating charge does not restrict the company’s conduct in its ordinary course, the sale of the charged assets in the ordinary course of business, or the imposition of additional charges and liens on the company’s assets. When the floating charge crystallizes (for example, upon a default), it becomes, in effect, a fixed charge over all the company’s assets at the time of crystallization. A security interest is generally created by an agreement between the company and the creditor (certain security interests by operation of law excluded). The security is perfected against third parties if registered with the Companies Registrar within 21 days of its creation (or, if created by a non-Israeli company, upon registration with the Registrar of Pledges); however, certain charges may be perfected by the possession of the asset by the creditor or its agent. A charge over real-estate of a company (a “mortgage”) must also be registered with the Land Registry ----- Bureau.

Under Israeli law, the realization of a pledge generally requires a court order or, with respect to certain assets, an order from the Office of Execution of Judgments and as a practical matter generally results in the appointment of a receiver to manage the assets under supervision of the court. Certain limited exemptions allowing for selfrealization apply with respect to certain pledges in favor of certain institutional entities (namely a “Banking Institution” under Israeli law, the Bank of Israel, Israeli insurance companies, Israeli Provident Funds Management Companies, and members of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange) and certain securities pledges in favor of certain institutional entities. Certain terms and conditions apply to any such “self help” realization procedures including, without limitation, the obligation to provide notice and the obligation to sell the pledged assets in the manner common in the applicable market of the asset (and in the absence of such market, in a reasonable commercial manner). Israeli courts would apply Israeli law for the creation, perfection, and enforcement of a security created by an Israeli company over its assets located in Israel. In addition, Israeli courts would generally apply Israeli law for the creation, perfection and enforcement of a security created by a non-Israeli company over shares physically located in Israel. _Insolvency_ On September 15, 2019, the new Insolvency and Rehabilitation law, 2018 came into effect (the “IRL”). Under the IRL, if a company is determined by the court to be insolvent, based on an application made by the company or by a creditor thereof, through an order issued by the court, it shall be placed either into rehabilitation proceedings or into liquidation proceedings (the “Initiation Order”). Upon the issuance of an Initiation Order with respect to an Israeli company (or a company having business or assets in Israel), an automatic stay of proceedings shall apply and the court will appoint a trustee who shall act for the liquidation or rehabilitation of the company (the “Trustee”). The court may also impose a stay of proceeding prior to the granting of the Initiation Order. As long as the stay of proceedings is in effect, the continuance or commencement of any proceeding against the company is prohibited other than with the permission of the court, and in the rehabilitation path secured creditors are restricted from enforcing their collateral during the stay period, unless the court is convinced that either (i) no adequate protection exists to safeguard the secured creditor's rights or (ii) enforcement of the secured creditor’s rights will not jeopardize the ability of the company to rehabilitate. However, in the liquidation path, a creditor holding a fixed charge must only notify the Trustee of his intention to enforce his security and the following would apply: if the charged asset(s) worth more than the debt to such creditor, the Trustee will monitor the sale of such asset, and if the debt is higher than the value of the secured asset, the secured creditor may carry out the sale without the supervision of the Trustee (but through an application to the court). Any balance from the realization exceeding the secured debt will form part of the estate to be distributed by the Trustee to the unsecured creditors. If the value of the security is less than the value of the debt, then the secured creditor may recover the balance of the sum owed to it (exceeding such value) pari passu with the unsecured creditors. A creditor having a floating charge (as opposed to a fixed charge), would only be entitled to 75% of the sale proceeds, and the rest of the proceeds will be distributed to unsecured creditors. The rest of the debt owed to such creditor would be deemed as unsecured debt. However, this rule does not apply to a company on the assets of which any floating charge was registered prior to September 15, 2019, provided that: (a) the charge was granted in connection with debt incurred prior to September 15, 2019, and no change was made to the term or to the interest rate of such debt; or (b) the insolvency proceedings were initiated not later than 18 months after September 15, 2019 (i.e. September 15, 2023). The insolvency court may annul any transaction entered into by the company with a creditor within three months (one year, with respect to an affiliated creditor) prior to filing of the application for Initiation Order, if at the time ----- of such transaction the debtor was insolvent (with a presumption that the debtor was insolvent, unless proved otherwise) and due to such transaction such creditor will receive a larger portion of the debt compared to the part that it would have received under the insolvency proceedings according to its priority. In addition, the insolvency court may annul any transaction entered into by the company with any third party within two years (four years, with respect to an affiliated third party) prior to filing of an application for Initiation Order, if at the time of such transaction the debtor was insolvent (with a presumption that the debtor was insolvent, unless proved otherwise) or the transaction caused the debtor to be insolvency and such transaction took an asset out of the company’s possession with no appropriate consideration paid to the company. Any such transaction that was made with an intent of deceiving creditors may be annulled if entered into by the company within seven years prior to the filing of petition for initiation order. _Special Regulatory Approvals_ The approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications is required prior to the realization of the security interest granted (whether directly or indirectly) over the shares of Cool Holding. There is no set time period for review by the Israeli Ministry of Communications and such approval may be withheld or delayed by the Israeli Ministry of Communications in its sole discretion. _Protected Negotiations_ Israeli Law permits certain companies to limit the rights of creditors, for a period of up to six months, in order to enable the conduct of negotiations for an arrangement with creditors without any court filing. This measure may be taken only by a publicly traded company and only if the board of directors of the company confirms that the company is not in a default under any debt that was due and there is no real concern that the company will not be able to pay its debts which are due during the successive nine months. During the protected negotiations period, the company will enjoy the following advantages with respect to each creditor to which a notice of protected negotiations was given: Such creditor will not be permitted to apply for a commencement of insolvency proceedings; he will not be permitted to apply to court for approval of an arrangement of debts proposed by him; and he will not be permitted to accelerate his debt (although this period may be shortened to 45 days). _Priority of Claims_ Generally, the priority of claims on an insolvent company’s assets will be determined in the following order: 1. Secured Creditors (excluding, however, any interest in arrears or other late payment fines accrued from the date of the Initiation Order and until the actual repayment of the secured debt. Any such penalty interest accrued after such date will be paid only after unsecured creditors were paid in full); 2. Insolvency proceedings expenses; 3. Preferential creditors, in the following order: employee wages (up to certain caps), income tax and social security payments withheld by the company, VAT debt (exclusive of any interest) accrued in the 12 months period prior to the issuance of the Initiation Order, and some other limited tax debts; 4. Pledgees under floating charges, subject to the limitations described above; 5. Unsecured creditors (exclusive of interest in arrears); 6. Payments to secured creditors of interest in arrears accrued after the date of the Initiation Order and payments to unsecured creditors of any interest accrued until the date of the Initiation Order; 7. Punitive payments imposed on the debtor; and 8. Payments to Shareholders. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,296,LIMITATION ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,296.3,Luxembourg,296.3.1,Security Interests,"The conditions to be satisfied by the granting of security interests relate to (i) corporate power, (ii) corporate authority and (iii) corporate benefit. These rules are derived from general principles and must be applied to specific circumstances, which have to be analyzed on a case by case basis. _Corporate power_ Limits on corporate power can be imposed either by (i) law or (ii) the articles of association of the Issuer. 1. Limitations imposed by law. Pursuant to the Luxembourg Civil Code, a company is incorporated with a view to participate in the profits (and the losses) which may arise therefrom. The goal to share the profits is an essential element of every company and therefore, a purely free (or gratuitous) act, without consideration, may be outside the scope of the activities of a company as contemplated by law. A company may however carry out gratuitous acts whenever these acts are accomplished with a view to the realization, directly or indirectly, of the Issuer’s corporate objective. It is normally understood that except in exceptional circumstances, an intragroup security is a type of act which may serve the purpose of realizing a profit. Thus, it is only in exceptional circumstances where there is no reasonable indirect potential benefit of, or a motivated interest for, a proposed guarantee/security to be given by a company, that the validity of such a guarantee/security interest could be challenged for lack of any interest by the guarantor in providing the guarantee/security interest. Further to this general legal restriction, additional limitations are imposed by specific laws, such as the prohibition to exercise a financial activity without a specific authorization (which in the case of a Luxembourg company, does not apply to financial activities within a group of companies) or the limitation on financial assistance to shareholders in the case of subscription or purchase of shares of the guarantor. 2. Limitations imposed by the articles of association. The provision of security interests by a company must be within the limits of the object clause of its articles of association. Should the provision of security by a Luxembourg company be considered to exceed the corporate objective as expressed in the articles of association, the Issuer is still bound by such action, unless there is evidence that the beneficiary of such acts knew that the acts exceeded the corporate objective or that the beneficiary could not, in light of the circumstances, have been unaware of that fact. _Corporate authority_ When a Luxembourg company grants security interests, applicable corporate procedures typically entail that the decision be approved by a board resolution or by decision of delegates that have been appointed for such purpose. _Corporate benefit_ The third condition for a security interest to be granted by a Luxembourg company is that the proposed action by the Issuer must be “in the corporate interest of the Issuer”, which is a translation of the French intérêt _social, an equivalent term to the English legal concept of corporate benefit. The concept of “corporate interest” is not defined by law, but has been developed by doctrine and court precedents and may be described as being “the limit of acceptable corporate behavior”. Whereas the previous discussions regarding the limits of corporate power are based on objective criteria (provisions of law and of the articles of association), the concept of corporate benefit requires subjective judgment. In that context, the concept of a group of companies may be relevant, and while it should first be analyzed whether a transaction is in the best interest of the Issuer on a standalone basis, it should also be examined whether the transaction is justified in the light of the interest at the level of the group, which may result in a benefit for the guarantor. ----- In general terms, group interest may justify the issue of granting of security in favor of a parent company (upstream guarantee) or a sister company (cross stream guarantee), under the following circumstances: - the proposed action must be justified on the basis of a common economic, social, or financial policy applicable throughout the whole group; - the existence of a group should be evidenced through capital links; or - the proposed action must (i) not be without any consideration, or alternatively (ii) not break up the balance between the undertakings of the various group companies. To the extent that all companies of the group are asked to bear the burden of security given for the benefit of the other group company or companies in an equal way, the obligation undertaken by a group company for the benefit of other group companies may be justified. Similarly, if a group company cannot exist outside of the group and is dependent on the group, assistance to other group companies should ultimately result in a benefit for such company. The limit of reasonable corporate behavior is reached when the transaction is exclusively in the interest of the parent company or the other companies of the group, without any benefit, direct or indirect, for the Luxembourg company granting the security. However, the failure to comply with the corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability for the directors or managers of the guarantor concerned. There is a limited risk that the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company be held liable if, inter alia: - the security interest provided would materially exceed the (direct or indirect) benefit derived from the secured obligations for the Luxembourg company; - the Luxembourg company derives no personal benefit or obtains no direct or indirect consideration for the security interest granted; or - the commitment of the Luxembourg company exceeds its financial means. In addition to any criminal and civil liability incurred by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company, the security interest could itself be held unenforceable, if it is held that it is contrary to public policy (ordre public). The above analysis is slightly different within a group of companies where a group interest (intérêt du groupe) exists. The existence of a group interest would prevent the security interest from falling foul of the above constraints. In order for a group interest to be recognized, the following cumulative criteria must be met and proven: - the “assisting” company must receive some benefit, or there must be a balance between the respective commitments of all the affiliates; - the guarantee must not exceed the assisting company’s financial means; - the companies involved must form part of a genuine group operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective; and - the assistance must be granted for purposes of promoting a common economic, social and financial interest determined in accordance with policies applicable to the entire group. The criteria mentioned above is applied on a case-by-case basis and a subjective fact-based judgment is required to be made by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg guarantor. As a result, the guarantees (upstream and cross stream) granted by a Luxembourg company are subject to certain limitations, which usually take the form of general limitation language, which is inserted in the relevant transaction document(s) and which covers the aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg assisting company under the transaction documents. The Indenture contains the following limitation language: ----- The guarantee granted by any guarantor which is incorporated and/or having its registered office and its place of central administration in Luxembourg (a “Luxembourg Guarantor”) for the obligations of the Issuer which is not a direct or indirect subsidiary of such Luxembourg Guarantor shall be limited at any time to an aggregate amount not exceeding: (i) the aggregate amount of the outstanding intercompany loans made to the Luxembourg Guarantor or subsidiaries of that Luxembourg Guarantor (which are subsidiaries of that Luxembourg Guarantor on the issue date or which will be subsidiaries of that Luxembourg Guarantor hereafter) by the Issuer, which have been funded directly or indirectly with proceeds deriving from the sale of the Notes, increased by (ii) the greater of: (a) 90% of the sum of the Luxembourg Guarantor’s own funds (capitaux propres) and subordinated debt (dettes subordonnées, including for the avoidance of doubt intragroup liabilities), both as referred to in Annex I of the Luxembourg Grand-Ducal Regulation of December 18, 2015 in relation to, _inter alia, Article 34 of the Luxembourg law of December 19, 2002 on the commercial register and annual accounts, as amended (the “2002 Law”) or, as applicable, as referred to in the Grand-Ducal Regulation of September 12, 2019 (Règlement Grand-Ducal du _12 septembre 2019 déterminant le contenu du plan comptable normalisé visé à l’article 12 du Code de commerce), as of the issue date (whether as original party or by way of accession);_ (b) 90% of the sum of the Luxembourg Guarantor’s own funds (capitaux propres) and subordinated debt (dettes subordonnées, including for the avoidance of doubt intragroup liabilities), both as referred to in Annex I of the Luxembourg Grand-Ducal Regulation of December 18, 2015 in relation to, inter alia, Article 34 of the 2002 Law, or, as applicable, as referred to in the GrandDucal Regulation of September 12, 2019 (Règlement Grand-Ducal du 12 septembre 2019 _déterminant le contenu du plan comptable normalisé visé à l’article 12 du Code de commerce),_ as at the date on which a demand is made under the Notes; (c) 90% of the net assets of the Luxembourg Guarantor calculated on the basis of the fair market value of the assets minus liabilities of the Luxembourg Guarantor (as determined by the agent or if the agent so decides by a Luxembourg statutory approved auditor (réviseur d’entreprise _agréé) (an “Independent Auditor”) as of the issue date (whether as original party or by way_ of accession); or (d) 90% of the net assets of the Luxembourg Guarantor calculated on the basis of the fair market value of the assets minus liabilities of the Luxembourg Guarantor (as determined by the Trustee or if the Trustee so decides by an Independent Auditor as of the date on which a demand is made under the Notes).",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc. If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law. The Collateral Act 2005 governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares, bank accounts and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Under the Collateral Act 2005, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A share pledge agreement over present and future shares must be registered in the shareholders’ register of such company. A receivables pledge becomes enforceable against the debtor and against third parties by the mere entering into the pledge agreement by the pledgor and the pledgee. However, the debtor is validly discharged from its payment obligations by payment to the pledgor as long as it has not gained knowledge of the pledge. ----- Article 11 of the Collateral Act 2005 sets out the following enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event: - appropriate or cause a third party to appropriate this collateral at a price determined, before or after appropriation, by the valuation method agreed by the parties; - assign or cause to be assigned the pledged collateral by private sale in a commercially reasonable manner, by sale over a stock exchange or by public auction; - court adjudication of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court appointed expert; or - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. As the Collateral Act 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be substantially delayed. The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Except as provided in Article 20(4) of the Collateral Act 2005, a third party creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledger, which are subject to such security through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries under the relevant pledge or security documents will remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale. Under Luxembourg law, security interests qualifying as financial collateral arrangements under the Collateral Act 2005 may be granted in favor of a person acting on behalf of the beneficiaries of such security interests, a fiduciary or a trustee as a security for the claims of third party beneficiaries, present or future, to the extent that such third party beneficiaries are or may be determined.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Luxembourg. In the event that a Luxembourg company experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. ----- Pursuant to Luxembourg insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment under the Notes may be more limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (collectively referred to as “insolvency proceedings”) may be opened against a company incorporated in Luxembourg having its center of main interests in Luxembourg or an establishment within the meaning of the Insolvency Regulation (in relation to secondary proceedings): - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the Issuer or by any of its creditors. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the Issuer: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may open bankruptcy proceedings on its own motion. The main effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the Issuer, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets; - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested by the Issuer and not by its creditors and under which a court may order a provisional suspension of payments, including a stay of enforcement of claims by secured creditors; or - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de faillite), the opening of which may only be requested by the Issuer (subject to obtaining the consent of the majority of its creditors) and not by its creditors themselves. The court’s decision to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors. In addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of a court to grant a reprieve from payments (sursis de paiement) or to put a Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity that violates criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the commercial code or of the Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow rules similar to those applicable to bankruptcy proceedings. Liability of a Luxembourg company in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the Issuer following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those debts of the relevant entity that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others: - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue; - VAT and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise; - social security contributions; and - remuneration owed to employees. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized). During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. The ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited, in particular in the event of controlled management proceedings providing expressly that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by the court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant Luxembourg company’s liabilities in order to take effect. Furthermore, declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings. Luxembourg insolvency law may affect transactions entered into or payments made by a Luxembourg company during the period before the opening of the insolvency proceedings. If the liquidator or administrator (including, without limitation, in relation to a Luxembourg company, any _commissaire,_ _juge-commissaire, liquidateur or _curateur or similar official) can show that the Luxembourg company has given “preference” to any person by_ ----- defrauding the rights of creditors generally, regardless of when this fraud occurred, a Luxembourg court has the power to void the “abnormal” transaction. If the liquidator or administrator can show that: (i) a payment in relation to a due debt was made during the hardening period (période suspecte, which is a maximum of six months and ten days preceding the judgment declaring the opening of the insolvency proceedings) that is disadvantageous to the general body of creditors; and/or (ii) the party receiving such payment is shown to have known that the bankrupt party had ceased to make payments when such payment occurred, a Luxembourg court has the power, among other things, to void the preferential transaction. In particular: - pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (code de commerce), specified transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts that have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by a bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; - pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; - pursuant to Article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and Article 1167 of the Civil Code (action _paulienne) the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent_ payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit; and - pursuant to Article 21(2) of the Collateral Act 2005, a financial collateral arrangement entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures is valid and binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers or liquidators notwithstanding the suspect period referred to in Articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it. In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of contracts except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the Issuer or its solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the insolvency receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the Issuer. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. The bankruptcy order provides for a period of time during which creditors must file their claims with the clerk’s office of the Luxembourg district court sitting in commercial matters. After having converted all available assets of the Issuer into cash and after having determined all the Issuer’s liabilities, the insolvency receiver will distribute the proceeds of the sale, on a pro rata basis, to the creditors after deduction of the receiver fees and the bankruptcy administration costs. Insolvency proceedings may therefore have a material adverse effect on a Luxembourg company’s business and assets and the Luxembourg company’s respective obligations under the notes. The bankruptcy receiver decides whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the bankruptcy receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply: - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the Issuer. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contracts. ----- The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party that are still to be performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the bankruptcy. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may not require specific performance of the contract. International aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or voluntary arrangement with creditors’ proceedings may be subject to the Insolvency Regulation. Pursuant to the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU Member State (other than Denmark) where the Issuer concerned has its “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation that any such company has its center of main interests in the EU Member State in which it has its registered office, Preamble 30 of the Insolvency Regulation states that the “center of main interests” of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third parties”. In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where a company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the majority of a company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where a company has its center of main interests. The time when a company’s center of main interests is determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. If the center of main interests of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the Issuer under the Insolvency Regulation would be opened in such jurisdiction, and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to open the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one EU Member State under the Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another EU Member State. If the center of main interests of a debtor is in one EU Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary proceedings” only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” (in the meaning of the Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other EU Member State. The effects of those secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other EU Member State. If a company does not have an establishment in any other EU Member State, no court of any other EU Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the Insolvency Regulation. To the extent that our center of main interests is deemed to be outside Luxembourg, courts of such other jurisdictions may have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of such company.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Limitations imposed by law. Pursuant to the Portuguese Companies Code (Código das Sociedades Comerciais) (the “Companies Code”), a company incorporated in Portugal (a “Portuguese Company”) has the capacity to enter into any agreements, including financing and security agreements as long as they are necessary or convenient to pursue its purposes. Therefore, a purely free (or gratuitous) act, without consideration, may be outside the scope of the activities of a company as contemplated by law. A company may however carry out gratuitous acts whenever these acts are deemed usual in accordance with the circumstances of time and the own means of the company. ----- The Companies Code sets outs some restrictions on capacity of Portuguese Companies, in particular in what concerns the granting of security interest and guarantees to secure and guarantee the obligations of third parties. Pursuant to article 6(3) of the Companies Code, companies may guarantee third parties’ obligations provided that: - The third party is in a controlling or a group relationship (relação de domínio ou de grupo) as defined in the Companies Code; or - The company has a justified own interest (justificado interesse próprio) in guaranteeing the obligations of such company. Under the Companies Code the definition of “controlling relationship” includes relationships between Portuguese companies where one holds, directly or indirectly the majority of the share capital or the voting rights in, or the right to appoint the majority of the members of the board of directors or supervisory board of another company on, the other company. A “group relationship” includes relationships between Portuguese companies where one is 100% owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the other or between companies that are bound by a group agreement or a subordination agreement whereby one company is subject to the instructions or management of the other. In the absence of a controlling or a group relationship, the validity of a guarantee/security interest could be challenged if there is no justified own interest (justificado interesse próprio). Further to this general legal restriction, additional limitations are imposed by specific laws, such as the prohibition to exercise a financial activity without a specific authorization or the limitation on financial assistance to shareholders or third parties, under the article 322 of the Companies Code, whereby the guarantee or security interest provided by a Portuguese company cannot be extended to cover any indebtedness used to fund, directly or indirectly, the acquisition or subscription of the share capital of such Portuguese company or its parent company (or, if applicable, in any other company which may indirectly control the Portuguese company). 2. Limitations imposed by the articles of association. The provision of guarantees or security interest by a company must be within the limits of the corporate purpose clause of its articles of association. Should the provision of a guarantee or security by a Portuguese company be considered to exceed the corporate purpose as expressed in the articles of association, the company is still bound by such action, unless there is evidence that the beneficiary of such acts knew that the acts exceeded the corporate purpose or that the beneficiary could not, in light of the circumstances, have been unaware of that fact.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,296,LIMITATION ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,296.4,Portugal,296.4.5,Security Interest Considerations,"_Governing law_ According to Portuguese conflict of law rules, the courts in Portugal will generally apply the lex rei sitae or lex _situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is situated) in relation_ to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Portuguese law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Portugal, such as registered shares in Portuguese companies, bank accounts held with a bank or branch (sucursal) in Portugal, receivables/claims governed by Portuguese law and/or having debtors located in Portugal, movable assets located in Portugal, securities which are held through a securities account located in Portugal, bearer securities physically located in Portugal, etc. If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Portugal, the security interests over such assets will be governed by Portuguese law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Portuguese law. _Perfection_ Under Portuguese law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification and/or acceptance requirements. As examples: (a) the pledge of nominative shares represented by share certificates must be (i) endorsed in the shares certificates and (ii) registered in the shareholders’ register of such company; (b) the receivables pledge becomes enforceable against the debtor after it has been notified to, or acknowledged by, the debtor; (c) the bank account pledge becomes effective against the banks after having been notified to, or acknowledged by, the banks; and (d) the mortgages over real estate must be registered with the Real Estate Registry Office. _Enforcement methods_ In the case of a share pledge, bank account pledge and receivable pledge or assignment as security, the enforcement methods which are generally considered more suitable are (i) private sale (venda extraprocessual), (ii) foreclosure (apropriação) in case of financial pledges and/or (iii) disposal of collateral assigned as security (venda executiva). The private sale and foreclosure are only allowed if the security agreement so provides. The foreclosure is permitted for financial pledges over securities and cash deposits and for commercial pledges governed by Decree Law 75/2017 of June 26, 2017, provided that the parties agree the valuation method. In case of non-financial pledges (other than pledges governed by Decree Law 75/2017 of June 26, 2017), the foreclosure must be carried out at the price determined by a court of law. Court enforcement is also possible but is usually considered to be lengthier and could prejudice the recovery of the claims. _Rights of third parties_ The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. A third party creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgor which are subject to such security through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries under the relevant pledge or security documents will remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale. In this case, the beneficiaries under the relevant pledge or security documents have to timely claim their credits (“reclamação de créditos”) within the scope of the court proceedings initiated by the third parties creditors. _Language_ Portuguese law documents may be executed in English. However, in case of enforcement the Portuguese courts or any other official Portuguese authority may require that the transaction documents and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into Portuguese. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

In addition to the Presumed Prejudicial Transactions described above, the insolvency administrator may also terminate any transactions entered upon by the Portuguese Company during the two years prior to the initiation of the insolvency proceedings, and are entered into in bad faith by the counterparty. Bad faith will be deemed to exist if the beneficiaries knew, at the time the security or guarantee was given, that (i) the Portuguese Company was insolvent, (ii) the granting of the security would be prejudicial and that the insolvency was imminent and (iii) the insolvency proceedings had already been initiated. Bad faith is presumed to exist in relation to any transaction entered upon with or benefiting a related entity in the two years before the initiation of the insolvency proceedings irrespective of whether such relation existed or not on the date the transaction was entered upon. - The issuance of an insolvency order by a court of competent authority in respect of a company results in a stay of proceedings. The insolvency order creates a stay on all enforcement actions pending against the debtor. After the issuance of the insolvency order, the administration and disposal of assets will be decided by a court appointed administrator. - Claims and rights of creditors of a company in insolvency proceedings may abate in whole or in part due to insufficient funds and assets of the company in insolvency. Under the Portuguese Insolvency Code higher ranking creditors of a certain class will be permitted to satisfy their interests prior to creditors of lower rankings, and creditors of the same class will have a pro rata right to secure and satisfy their interest with other creditors of the same class. Creditors holding a pledge or charge in relation to the insolvent’s assets rank higher in priority to shareholders and other unsecured creditors of a company. Such creditors are entitled to receive the proceeds from the disposal of the pledged asset to satisfy their claim but will be treated as unsecured creditors with respect to any portion thereof not entirely satisfied by the proceeds received from the disposal of the pledge if such proceeds are insufficient to repay their entire claim. Creditors holding a pledge or charge may, however, be only be paid after (i) the debts of the insolvent company incurred during the insolvency proceedings, the court fees and other costs concerning the proceeding, subject to certain requirements and limits, (ii) the debts of creditors statutorily preferred under Portuguese law (e.g. tax authorities holding a lien in respect of taxes owed and not paid on real estate property of the company) and (iii) the debts of certain creditors holding statutory liens (e.g. employees). -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

As a consequence, Dominican law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located in the Dominican Republic. _Perfection/Lien_ Under Dominican law, the perfection of security interests and creation of liens depend on certain registration, notification and/or acceptance requirements applicable according to the type of security being perfected. On February 18, 2020, Law No. 45-20 on Movable Collateral (“Law 45-20”) was enacted with the purpose of establishing a legal framework that encourages the use of movable collateral. This new law, among other things, creates a public electronic registration system, the Electronic System of Movable Collateral (“SEGM”, for its acronym in Spanish), and a unitary regime applicable to the incorporation, effectiveness, publicity, registration, priority, execution and other matters related to security interests over movable assets in the Dominican Republic. In the legal system of the Dominican Republic, movable collateral refers to all preferential rights that constitute movable assets, such as a pledge, universal pledge, assignment of rights by way of security, chattel pledge with or without dispossession or any other asset included under the unitary concept of movable collateral. The SEGM is an electronic file with remote access where movable collateral are published in accordance with Law 45-20, and its implementation is governed by regulations issued by the Executive Branch at the request of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and MiPymes (micro, small and medium enterprises), along with complementary regulations of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and other internal provisions issued for its operation. The regulation on implementation of the SEGM has yet to be enacted and the system yet to be implemented. As Law 45-20 entered into force on December 2020, all its dispositions, including those related to the repeal of all existing legal dispositions on the perfection and creation of pledges over shares, chattel pledges, assignment of rights by way of security, among others, have entered into force. Currently, there is lack of clarity with respect to the manner in which security interest in movable collateral should be perfected as without the creation and implementation of the SEGM, the perfection of movable collateral cannot be completed. As of the date hereof, there is a bill in the Dominican Congress (already approved by the House of Representatives), which seeks to postpone the entry into force of Law 45-20 until the year 2023. If the entry into force of Law 4520 is postponed until 2023, movable collateral may be registered/perfected in the manner established by Dominican regulation existing prior to the entry into force of Law 45-20. _Enforcement methods_ In general, foreclosure requires judicial foreclosure procedures to be carried out before Dominican courts. Procedures vary depending on the type of asset/security being foreclosed on. There are certain requirements providing for notification to debtor, publicity and court hearings. Procedures normally end with a sale of the underlying asset at a public auction. However, in some cases (such as foreclosure on a pledge) creditor can either ask the court to sell the pledged assets at a public auction or request the court that the said assets be transferred to the creditor in payment of the secured debt. Contractual provisions allowing a creditor obtain ownership of the underlying asset without following judicial foreclosure procedures are generally considered null. _Rights of third parties_ The existence of security interests created pursuant to pledge/security agreements does not prevent third party creditors from seeking attachment or execution of assets already subject to a security interest created in favor of another creditor. A third party creditor may seek the forced sale of the said assets through court proceedings, although the secured creditor can oppose and should be entitled to priority over the proceeds of the sale. _Language_ Documents creating security may be executed in English or another language. However, for registration and enforcement purposes or any other official use, a translation into Spanish prepared by an Official Translator duly authorized in the Dominican Republic is required. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Until the promulgation and entry into force of Law 141-15, the Dominican legal system did not contemplate the restructuring of companies and individuals traders, but used such figures as bankruptcy and liquidation. Law 141-15 has introduced new figures of its own in order to enable the effective application of its provisions and orders the establishment of specialized courts to hear judicial proceedings. Law 141-15 regulates the process applicable to: (i) the natural persons traders, be they national or foreign; and (ii) national companies and those that have established domicile or have a permanent presence in the country. Its purpose is mainly to: (i) protect creditors against the insolvency of their debtors; and (ii) help debtors overcome their insolvency situation, ensuring their operational continuity. One of the pillars of Law 141-15 is the creation of the restructuring and liquidation jurisdiction, composed of the Restructuring and Liquidation Courts of First Instance and the Appeals Courts of Restructuring and Liquidation. The decisions of the latter may be appealed in cassation before the Civil and Commercial Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. Law 141-15 also creates two special courts located in Santiago and in the National District, which will be territorially competent to cover the other jurisdictions of the country. The restructuring can be requested from the competent Court of Restructuring and Liquidation (the “Court”), both by the debtor and/or by one of the creditors to whom Law 141-15 grants quality for this. Once the request for restructuring has been made, the Court should order the appointment of a verifier to confirm the debtor’s financial situation and to inform the Court of the results of its investigations. Once a restructuring application is submitted by the debtor, or when it is notified to the latter if it emanates from the creditor, the debtor is subject to an obligation to inform the court and the verifier of any act of administration or provision aimed at changing the bylaws, implementation of mergers, constitution of guarantees, payments, transactions, conciliations, execution of agreements with creditors, or disposal of assets or rights. The rule allows the parties to submit a Preliminary Agreement of Restructuring Plan, which if accepted by the Court, will have the same effect as the restructuring ordered by said Court. If the Court welcomes the restructuring process, it orders the notification and initiates the Conciliation and Negotiation process, which will be guided by a Personal Conciliator appointed by the same Court. During this process all judicial, administrative or arbitral actions against the estate are suspended, as well as any executive, eviction or seizure of movable and immovable property of the debtor, the calculation of interests, enforcement procedures of tax credits and other payments, so that the debtor can continue with the operation of the business. Precisely for the purposes of business continuity during the conciliation process, it is envisaged that, at the request of the conciliator and without an objection from the majority of creditors, the Court may authorize new financing at the expense of the debtor to ensure continuity of ordinary operations. At the request of the creditors duly substantiated, the Personal Conciliator may bring an action for annulment against acts performed by the Debtor within two years prior to the date of the request for restructuring, when those acts have constituted an unjustified distraction of the property of the estate. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—The Notes may not become, or remain, listed _on the Exchange”._ The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion without notice. In addition, such market-making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell which will be favorable. You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities. In connection with the offering, each Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, each Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. Each Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over allot the offering of the Notes, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, each Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. Each Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may enter into in the future investment banking, financial advisory and/or lending and commercial banking transactions with, and/or may perform other services for, to us and/or our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive customary fees, commissions and reimbursement of expenses (including acting as initial purchasers, arrangers and/or lenders in connection with previous issuances of debt securities and debt facilities of the Issuer or its affiliates).

If a foreign judgment is enforced by an Israeli court, it generally will be payable in Israeli currency, which can then be converted into non-Israeli currency and transferred out of Israel.

Pending collection, the amount of the judgment of an Israeli court stated in Israeli currency ordinarily will be linked to the Israeli consumer price index plus a per annum statutory rate of interest set on a quarterly basis by Israeli regulations.

(the ""Company"") and its subsidiaries (the ""Group""), which comprise the interim consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2021, the interim consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the three-month period then ended and the notes to the condensed interim consolidated financial statements (""the Condensed interim consolidated financial statements""). The Board of Managers is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” as adopted by the European Union. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated interim financial statements based on our review. Scope of Review We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” as adopted, for Luxembourg, by the Institut des Réviseurs d’Entreprises. A review of condensed interim consolidated financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. © 2021 KPMG Luxembourg, Société coopérative, a Luxembourg entity and ----- ### Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Condensed interim consolidated financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as adopted by the European Union.

A second earnout is due in December 2026 subject to some performance conditions and the Company did not take into consideration this second earnout in the valuation of the purchase price and thus the capital gain recognised at closing of the transaction. Following the closing of the transaction, PT Portugal continues to control and fully consolidate FastFiber. The transaction resulted in the recognition of a noncontrolling interest of €4.0 million and a gain of €1,111.5 million in equity. FastFiber will sell wholesale services to all operators at the same financial terms. MEO will sell technical services to FastFiber for the construction, the subscriber connection and the maintenance of its fibre network.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Other significant events,299.35.1,,"_Portugal pre-retirement program_ In connection with an ongoing transformation process of the Group in Portugal, in a severe context resulting not only from the COVID-19 pandemic but also from a hostile and troubled regulatory environment, some of the Group companies in Portugal have launched a voluntary employee reduction program in March 2021. This program is aimed at employees of 50 years old or more and those that decide to enroll in the program, subject to the companies’ acceptance, have their employment agreements terminated and will be entitled to receive a monthly fixed compensation up to retirement age corresponding to a percentage of their previous remuneration. The deadline for employees to enroll in the program has finished in the second quarter, but the selection process of the employees that will be allowed to terminate their employment agreements under this pre-retirement scheme is still ongoing. As of March 31, 2021, management considered that the conditions for recording a liability were met under IAS 19 Employee benefits and thus a liability was recognised in the caption ""provisions"" in the statement of financial position and in the caption “other (expense) and income” of the income statement for an amount of €241.1 million, relating to approximately 750 employees and corresponding primarily to the present value of salaries payable up to retirement age to the employees that agreed to terminate their employment agreements under pre-retirement schemes. Based on information up to date, the Company expects to record an additional liability in the second quarter of 2021 relating to approximately 200 employees.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Definition of segments,299.39.1,,"Given the geographical spread of the entities within the Group, analysis by geographical area is fundamental in determining the Group’s strategy and managing its different businesses. The Group’s chief operating decision maker is the Board of Managers. The Board of Managers analyses the Group’s results across geographies, and certain key areas by activity. The presentation of the segments here is consistent with the reporting used internally by the Board of Managers to track the Group’s operational and financial performance. The businesses that the Group owns and operates do not show significant seasonality, except for the mobile residential and business services, which can show significant changes in sales at year end and at the end of the summer season (the “back to school” period). The business services are also impacted by the timing of preparation of the annual budgets of public and private sector companies. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies. The segments that are presented are detailed below: - **Portugal: The Group owns Portugal Telecom (“PT Portugal”), the largest telecom operator in Portugal. PT Portugal caters to fixed residential, mobile residential and business services clients using the MEO brand. This segment also includes the Altice Technical Services entities in Portugal. - **Israel: Fixed and mobile services are provided using the HOT telecom, HOT mobile and HOT net brands to residential and business services clients. HOT also produces award winning exclusive content that it distributes using its fixed network, as well as content application called Next and OTT services through Next Plus. This segment also includes the Altice Technical Services entity in Israel. - **Dominican Republic: The Group provides fixed residential, mobile residential and business services using the Altice brand. This segment also includes the Altice Technical Services entity in the Dominican Republic. - **Teads: Provides digital advertising solutions. - **Others: Corporate entities are reported under “Others”.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Financial Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”),299.40.1,,"The Board of Managers has defined certain financial KPIs that are tracked and reported by each operating segment every month to the senior executives of the Company. The Board of Managers believes that these indicators offer them the best view of the operational and financial efficiency of each segment, and this follows best practices in the rest of the industry, thus providing investors and other analysts a suitable base to perform their analysis of the Group’s results. The financial KPIs tracked by the Board of Managers are: - Revenues: by segment and in terms of activity, - Adjusted EBITDA: by segment, - Capital expenditure (“Capex”): by segment, and - Operating free cash flow (“OpFCF”): by segment. _4.2.1._ _Revenues_ Additional information on the revenue split is presented as follows: - Residential revenue `o` Fixed: revenues from fixed services to B2C customers; `o` Mobile: revenues from mobile services to B2C subscribers; `o` Equipment business to B2C subscribers; - Business services: revenues from B2B customers, wholesale and other revenues; and - Media: media and advertisement revenues in Teads. ----- Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements Intersegment revenues mainly relate to services rendered by certain centralized Group functions (relating to centralized research) to the operational segments of the Group. _4.2.2._ _Non-GAAP measures_ Adjusted EBITDA, Capex and OpFCF are non-GAAP measures. These measures are useful to readers of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements as they provide a measure of operating results excluding certain items that the Group’s management believe are either outside of its recurring operating activities, or items that are non-cash. Excluding such items enables trends in the Group’s operating results and cash flow generation to be more easily observable. The non-GAAP measures are used by the Group internally to manage and assess the results of its operations, make decisions with respect to investments and allocation of resources, and assess the performance of management personnel. Such performance measures are also the de facto metrics used by investors and other members of the financial community to value other companies operating in the same industry as the Group and thus are a basis for comparability between the Group and its peers. Moreover, the debt covenants of the Group are based on the Adjusted EBITDA and other associated metrics. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA used in the covenants has not changed with the adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases by the Group. _4.2.2.1._ _Adjusted EBITDA_ Following the application of IFRS 16 _Leases, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, other expenses and income (capital gains, non-recurring litigation, restructuring costs) and share-based expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IAS 17 Leases for operating leases). This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating income as the effects of depreciation, amortization and impairment, excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, do ultimately affect the operating results. Operating results presented in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements are in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. _4.2.2.2._ _Capex_ Capex is an important indicator to follow, as the profile varies greatly between activities: - The fixed business has fixed Capex requirements that are mainly discretionary (network, platforms, general), and variable capex requirements related to the connection of new customers and the purchase of Customer Premises Equipment (TV decoder, modem, etc.). - Mobile Capex is mainly driven by investment in new mobile sites, upgrade to new mobile technology and licenses to operate; once engaged and operational, there are limited further Capex requirements. - Other Capex is mainly related to costs incurred in acquiring content rights. _4.2.2.3._ _Operating free cash flow_ OpFCF is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capex. This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating cash flow as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with IAS 7 Statement of Cashflows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Following the application of IFRS 16 _Leases, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, other expenses and incomes (capital gains, non-recurring litigation, restructuring costs) and share-based expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IAS 17 Leases for operating lease). The Board of Managers and the Group’s senior executives have determined that there have not been any changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. In addition, there were no significant changes in assets or liabilities in any CGU/GCGU. Therefore, no updated impairment testing was performed, nor any impairment recorded, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The non-current portion of other financial liabilities amounts to ----- Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements €1,857.1 million as at March 31, 2021, an increase of €18.0 million compared to December 31, 2020. Details of the main items within the caption, and the movements from the prior period, are detailed below. _8.7.1._ _Lease liabilities_ Leases relate to the current and non-current lease liabilities recorded in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases. _8.7.2._ _Reverse factoring_ Through the use of reverse factoring structures, the Group extends its payment terms up to 360 days, reducing its requirements for working capital. The contractual arrangements in place permit the supplier to obtain the amounts invoiced at agreed payment terms with the amounts paid by the banks that participate in the reverse factoring structure. The Group will repay the banks the full invoice amount, with interest, on the scheduled payment date as required by the reverse factoring agreement. Based on the scheduled payment dates, the amounts payable under this arrangement are accounted for as current liabilities. As the amounts are payable to the participating banks, the amounts have been presented under Other financial liabilities. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, the cash flows related to reverse factoring are presented under Changes in working capital or Payments to acquire tangible and intangible assets depending on the nature of the expenditure, and in addition in the financing flows are presented under Payments made to suppliers through factoring arrangements and Payments made to factoring companies. The increase in reverse factoring as at March 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 is due to the combination of timing of reverse factoring capacity with the banks. _8.7.3._ _Accrued interest_ Accrued interest is the amount of interest due at the reporting date regarding the Company’s outstanding debentures and loans from financial institutions. The decrease in accrued interest is the consequence of the refinancing transactions in 2020 which have led to permanent interest cost savings and consequently a decrease in accrued interest. _8.7.4._ _Put options with non-controlling interests_ The Group executes agreements with the non-controlling interests in certain acquisitions whereby the noncontrolling interests have the option to sell their non-controlling interests to the Group. These instruments are measured at their fair value at the reporting date. _8.7.5._ _Mandatory Convertible Notes Portugal_ On April 17, 2020, PT Portugal and Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners entered into a subscription agreement regarding the issuance and subscription of €1,600.0 million mandatory convertible notes in which the parties subscribed considering the percentage of interest in equity of FastFiber. The €848.8 million relates to the financial liability of the Group towards Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners, consisting of the notional amount of €799.8 million and an additional subscription of €49.0 million. The notes bear interest on their aggregate principal amount at the fixed rate of 6.00% per annum. Interest is due in May and November of each year. At any time on or after the date that is twenty years after the date of issue, all or part of the notes issued can be converted into shares with mutual consent. The principle of the convertible notes do not have a stated maturity and will never become payable in cash. _8.7.6._ _Mandatory Convertible Notes Altice Luxembourg_ The Mandatory Convertible Notes (“MCN”) were issued for an aggregate amount of €2,055 million, which were entirely subscribed by the Company’s sole shareholder, Altice Luxembourg. These instruments are compound financial instruments that contain both a liability and an equity component. As a result of the full reimbursement of Altice Luxembourg senior debt in the first quarter of 2020, the Company obtained the right to convert all or part of the MCN issued into shares with no limitation in time up until the maturity date.

Ltd. Level 1 Quoted share price 5.3 5.8 _9.1.3._ _Information on valuation techniques 9.1.3.1. Investments in listed entities_ Quoted prices directly available from an active market are used to source the fair value, i.e. the quoted share price of the listed investments in Partner Co. These valuations are directly observable in an open market and therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. _9.1.3.2._ _Derivative financial instruments_ Future cash flows are estimated using market observable data at the end of the reporting period (namely, forward exchange rates and interest rates) and the contracted rates of the derivative discounted at a rate that reflects the counterparty credit risk. Since model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgement, the Company has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. _9.1.3.3._ _Put options_ Each contract has specific terms and conditions, and the valuation is performed using the contracted terms and assessment against market comparable information where appropriate. For example, the exercise price in the option may be determined based on an EBITDA multiple minus the net financial debt. In all instances, the probabilities of the option being exercised is determined using management’s best estimate and judgement. The resulting fair value is discounted using appropriate discount rates of the related funding pool. These models use a variety of inputs that use judgements not able to be verified externally, therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. _9.1.3.4._ _Call options_ The valuation is derived by calculating the intrinsic value, being the difference in the value of the underlying asset and the options exercise price, and time value of the option, which accounts for the passage of time until the option expires. Various inputs are used, including the price of the underlying asset and its volatility, the strike price and maturity in the contract, and the risk-free rate and dividend yield. The model calculates the possible prices of the underlying asset and their respective probability of occurrence, given these inputs. These models use a variety of inputs that use judgements not able to be verified externally, therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. _9.1.4._ _Assumptions with management judgement used in fair value measurement_ The instruments in Level 3 are the put and call options with the non-controlling interests in acquired entities. The valuation methods used to determine the fair value of these instruments include certain inputs that do not use publicly available information and therefore require management’s judgement. Those with significant impact on the fair value of the instruments concerned are deemed to be categorized as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Further details on these valuation methods and the associated inputs using judgements and which can have a significant impact on the fair value are presented below. ----- Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and for the year then ended are presented in millions of Euros, except as otherwise stated, and have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted in the European Union (“IFRS”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain properties and financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company considers the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 16 _Leases, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value_ in IAS 2 Inventories or value in use in IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. For financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows: - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date; - Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability (please refer to note 19). ----- Where the accounting treatment of a specific transaction is not addressed by any accounting standard and interpretation, the Board of Managers applies its judgment to define and apply accounting policies that provide information consistent with the general IFRS concepts: faithful representation and relevance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,300,REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE,300.33,1.3.** **Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs),300.33.1,,"1.3.1. _Standards applicable for the reporting period The following standards have mandatory application for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020 as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements: - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of Material, effective on or after January 1, 2020; - Amendments to IFRS 3 Definition of a Business, effective on or after January 1, 2020; - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards, effective on or after January 1, 2020; and - Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases, Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions, effective on or after June 1, 2020, with early application permitted. The application of amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8, IFRS 3 and to References of the Conceptual Framework in IFRS standards had no material impact on the amounts recognised and on the disclosures in these consolidated financial statements. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, an amendment to IFRS 16 was issued in May 2020 in order to provide practical relief for lessees in accounting for rent concessions. Under the practical expedient, lessees are not required to assess whether eligible rent concessions are lease modifications. Rent concessions are eligible for practical expedient if they occur as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and if all of the following criteria are met: - The change in lease payments results in revised consideration for the lease that is substantially the same as, or less than, the consideration for the lease immediately preceding the change; - Any reduction in lease payments affects only payments originally due on or before June 30, 2021; - There is no substantive change to the other terms and conditions of the lease. The Group has applied the amendment retrospectively and the amendment has no impact on retained earnings as of January 1, 2020. The amount recognised in the income statement for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020 to reflect changes in lease payments arising from rent concessions to which the Group applies the practical expedient for COVID-19 related rent concession is not material. In addition, the IFRIC published a decision in November 2019 which establishes that the determination of the enforceable period of a lease and the lease term itself consider broad economic circumstances beyond purely contractual terms. The committee considers that a lease arrangement remains enforceable as long as lessee, or lessor, would have to support a loss or a more than insignificant penalty in the event of termination of the contract. The assessment of the impact for the Group of the IFRIC decision has been finalised and there was no material impact on ----- the amounts recognised as Right of use and Lease Liabilities at the date of first implementation of IFRS 16 Leases as of January 1, 2019. 1.3.2. _Standards and interpretations not applicable as of reporting date The Group has not early adopted the following standards and interpretations, for which application is not mandatory for period started from January 1, 2020 and that may impact the amounts reported: - Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or _Joint Venture, effective date of the amendments has not yet been determined by the IASB;_ - Amendments in Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1), effective on or after January 1, 2023; - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020, effective on or after January 1, 2022; and - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16), effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, with earlier application permitted. The Board of Managers anticipates that the application of those amendments will not have a material impact on amounts reported in respect of the Group's financial assets and financial liabilities. 1.3.1. _Standards applicable for the reporting period The following standards have mandatory application for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 as described in note 1.3.3: - IFRS 16 Leases, effective on January 1, 2019; ### • Annual improvements cycle 2015-2017, effective on or after January 1, 2019; - IFRS Interpretation Committee (“IFRIC”) 23: Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019; - Amendments to IFRS 9: Prepayments features with Negative Compensation, effective on or after January 1, 2019; - Amendments to IAS 28: Long term interests in Associates and Joint ventures, effective on or after January 1, 2019; - Amendments to IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement, effective on or after January 1, 2019; and - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendment to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7), effective on or after January 1, 2020. The application of amendments to IAS 19, IAS 28, IFRS 9 and annual improvements cycle 2015-2017 had no material impact on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements and had no material impact on the disclosures in these Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, IFRIC 23 had no material impact on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements and resulted in a reclassification of the provisions for tax risk to deferred tax liabilities and current tax payable. The impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases and the accounting policies relating to the application of the IFRS 16 _Leases are described respectively in notes 1.3.3 and 2.12._ In addition, the Group has elected to make an early application, from January 1, 2019, of the amendment related to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 published in September 2019 by the IASB (effective on or after January 1, 2020). In the new amendment, the IASB has modified specific hedge accounting requirements so that entities would apply those hedge accounting requirements assuming that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and cash flows of the hedging instrument are based is not altered as a result of the uncertainties of the interest rate benchmark reform. The amendments apply to all hedging relationships that are directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform. Interest rate benchmark reform refers to the market-wide reform of an interest rate benchmark, including the replacement of an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate such as that resulting from the recommendations set out in the FSB’s July 2014 report Reforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks. Based on the application of the new amendment, the existing hedge accounting relationships within the Group are not impacted as a result of the uncertainties of the interest rate benchmark reform. The Group is assessing the consequences related to the future modification of the interest rate benchmark. ----- 1.3.2. _Standards and interpretations not applicable as of reporting date The Group has not early adopted the following standards and interpretations, for which application is not mandatory for periods before January 1, 2020 and that may impact the amounts reported: - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Definition of Material, effective on or after January 1, 2020; - Amendments to IFRS 3: Definition of a Business, effective on or after January 1, 2020; - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards, effective on or after January 1, 2020; - Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or _Joint Venture, effective date of the amendments has not yet been determined by the IASB; and_ - Amendments in Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1), effective on or after January 1, 2022. The Board of Managers anticipates that the application of those amendments will not have a material impact on amounts reported in respect of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities. 1.3.3. _IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 _Leases, IFRIC 4_ _Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 _Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. The standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and_ requires lessees to account for most leases under a single on-balance sheet model. The change of definition of a lease mainly relates to the conception of control. IFRS 16 determines whether a contract contains a lease on the basis of whether the customer has the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration. Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from IAS 17. Lessors will continue to classify leases as either operating or finance leases using similar principles as in IAS 17. Therefore, IFRS 16 did not have an impact for leases where the Group is the lessor. The Group adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method of adoption with the date of initial application of January 1, 2019. Under this method, the standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised at the date of initial application. Therefore, the Consolidated Financial Statements were not restated under the new standard. The effect of adoption IFRS 16 as at January 1, 2019 is as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

In this context and following regulatory requirements published by governments over the last months in the countries in which the Group operates, the Group activated a response program in order to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic had a limited impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group as of December 31, 2020 and for the twelve-month periods then ended. The Group has been impacted by a decline in handsets sales (low margin activity) in the context of the closure of the shops in many countries where the Group operates, a decrease in roaming revenue and a decline in the advertising businesses (Teads). The impact has remained limited since the beginning of the crisis demonstrating the resilience of the Group’s telecom business in the countries where the Group operates. Although the situation continues to evolve, the Company expects that the COVID-19 pandemic will have limited effects on the Group’s operations and financial performance for future periods. In countries where the Group operates, the Group did not benefit from specific programs that required the compliance with particular conditions. The Group has taken this situation into account in its estimates, notably those related to the non-current and current assets valuation (including goodwill) (please refer to note 5.1).

The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. If the Group does not have a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. ----- The Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether the Group’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including: - the size of the Group’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders; - potential voting rights held by the Group, other vote holders or other parties; - rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and - any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Group has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings.

1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,300,REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE,300.38,2.3.** **Revenue recognition,300.38.1,,"Revenue from the Group’s activities is mainly composed of television, broadband internet, fixed and mobile telephony subscription, installations fees invoiced to residential and business clients and advertising revenues. Revenue comprises the expected consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, discounts and after eliminating intercompany sales within the Group. In accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the revenue recognition model includes five steps for analysing transactions so as to determine when to recognise revenue and at what amount: (1) Identifying the contract with the customer. (2) Identifying separate performance obligations in the contract. (3) Determining the transaction price. (4) Allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations. (5) Recognizing revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied. For bundled packages, the Group accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct – i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if the product or service is distinct from other items in the bundle. The consideration is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the market prices at which the Group sells the mobile devices and telecommunications services separately. This could lead to the recognition of a contract asset – a receivable arising from the customer contract that has not yet legally come into existence – in the statement of financial position. The contract asset is amortized over the enforceable period. Enforceable period has been determined for each agreement. It represents the period over which rights and obligation are enforceable. This period is determined not only by the commitment period as stated in the contract, but also by business practices and contracts mechanisms (early renewal, exit options, penalties and other clauses). 2.3.1. _Revenues from the sale of equipment The Group recognises revenues when a customer takes possession of the device, which is the performance obligation. This usually occurs when the customer signs a new contract. The amount of revenue includes the sale of mobile devices and ancillary equipment for those devices. For mobile devices sold separately, customers pay in full at the point of sale or in several instalments (credit agreement). ----- 2.3.2. _Revenues on separable components of bundle packages Revenues from telephone packages are recorded as a sale with multiple components. Revenues from sales of handsets (mobile phones and other) are recorded upon activation of the line, net of discounts granted to the customer via the point of sale and the costs of activation. When elements of these transactions cannot be identified or analysed separately from the main offer, they are considered as related elements and the associated revenues are recognised in full over the duration of the contract or the expected duration of the customer relationship. 2.3.3. _Revenue from service Revenues from subscriptions for basic cable services, digital television pay, Internet and telephony (fixed and mobile) are recognised in revenue on a straight-line basis over the subscription period; revenues from telephone calls are recognised in revenue when the service is rendered in accordance with the term of the contract. The Group sells certain telephone subscriptions based on plans under which the call minutes for a given month can be carried over to the next month if they are not used. The minutes carried over are recorded as a liability based on the proportion of total telephone subscription revenues they represent. Revenues related to carried over minutes are recognized when the minutes are used or when they expire. Revenues relative to incoming and outgoing calls and off-plan calls are recorded when the service is provided. Revenues generated by vouchers sold to distributors and by prepaid mobile cards are recorded each time use is made by the end customer, as from when the vouchers and cards are activated. Any unused portion is recorded in contract liabilities at the end of the reporting period. Revenues are in any case recognised upon the expiry date of the cards, or when the use of the vouchers is statistically unlikely. Sales of services to subscribers managed by the Group on behalf of content providers (principally special numbers and SMS+) are recorded on a gross basis, or net of repayments to the content providers when the content providers are responsible for the content and determine the pricing applied to the subscriber. Please refer to note 2.3.8 for a consideration of when the Group acts as a principal or an agent. The costs of access to the service or installation costs principally billed to operator and corporate clients in relation to DSL connection services, bandwidth services, and IP connectivity services, are recognised over the expected duration of the contractual relationship and the provision of the principal service. Installation service revenue is deferred and recognised over the benefit period. For business service subscribers, the benefit period is the contract term, which is defined and agreed for 2 years or more. For residential customers, there is no commitment period and installation costs are recognised over the estimated benefit period. Revenues linked to switched services are recognised each time traffic is routed. Revenues from bandwidth, IP connectivity, high-speed local access and telecommunications services are recorded as and when the services are delivered to the customers. 2.3.4. _Access to telecommunications infrastructures The Group provides its operator clients with access to its telecommunications infrastructures by means of different types of contracts: rental, hosting contracts or concessions of Indefeasible Rights of Use (‘‘IRU’’). The IRU contracts grant the use of an asset (ducting, fibre optic or bandwidth) for a specified period. The Group remains the owner of the asset. Proceeds generated by rental contracts, hosting contracts in Netcenters, and infrastructure IRUs are recognised over the duration of the corresponding contracts, except where these are defined as a finance lease, in which case the equipment is considered as having been sold on credit. In the case of IRUs, and sometimes rentals or service agreements, the service is paid in advance in the first year. These prepayments, which are non-refundable, are recorded in deferred income within Contract liabilities caption (current and non-current) in the Statement of Financial Position and recognised over the expected term of the related agreements. ----- 2.3.5. _Sales of infrastructure The Group builds infrastructure on behalf of certain clients. The average duration of the construction work is less than one year; therefore, revenues are recorded when ownership is transferred. A provision is recognised when any contracts are expected to prove onerous. 2.3.6. _Advertising revenues Advertising revenues are recognised when commercials are aired. For revenue related to space to display video advertisements online sold either directly to clients or to advertising agencies (the clients), the Group generates revenue when a user clicks on the banner ad or views the advertisement. The Group prices the advertising campaigns on a cost per view (“CPV”) model or a cost per mille (“CPM”) model based on the number of views generated by users on each advertising campaign. Revenue is recognised when four basic criteria are met: - persuasive evidence exists of an arrangement with the client reflecting the terms and conditions under which the services will be provided (insertion order, which are commonly based on specified CPVs and related campaign budgets); - services have been provided or delivery has occurred. Income relating to services provided is recorded based on the stage of completion of the service. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the work performed at the reporting date. For on-going service agreements, the stage of completion is prorated over time. In case of negative margin for a campaign, a provision for an onerous contract is booked; - the fee is fixed or determinable; and - collection is probable. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including the creditworthiness of a client, the size and nature of a client’s website and transaction history. Amounts billed or collected in excess of revenue recognised are included as deferred revenue. An example of such deferred revenue would be arrangements whereby clients request or are required by the Group to pay in advance of delivery. 2.3.7. _Income from credit arrangements Revenues deriving from long-term credit arrangements (such as the sale of devices in instalments) are recorded at the present value of the future cash flows (against long-term receivables) and are discounted in accordance with market interest rates. The difference between the original amount of the credit and the present value, as aforesaid, is spread over the length of the credit period and recorded as interest income over the length of the credit period. 2.3.8. _Gross versus net revenue recognition The Group determines whether it is acting as a principal or as an agent. The Group is acting as a principal if it controls a promised good or service before it is transferred to a customer. Indicators for acting as a principal include: (1) the Group is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service, (2) the Group has inventory risk in the specified good or service and (3) the Group has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. On the other hand, the Group is acting as an agent or an intermediary, if these criteria are not met. When the Group is acting as an agent, revenue is presented on a net basis in the statement of income. When the Group is acting as principal, revenue is presented on a gross basis. Revenue from the Group’s activities is mainly composed of television, broadband internet, fixed and mobile telephony subscription, installations fees invoiced to residential and business clients and advertising revenues. Revenue comprises the expected consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, discounts and after eliminating intercompany sales within the Group. In accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the revenue recognition model includes five steps for analysing transactions so as to determine when to recognise revenue and at what amount: - Identifying the contract with the customer. - Identifying separate performance obligations in the contract. - Determining the transaction price. - Allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations. ----- - Recognizing revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied. For bundled packages, the Group accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct – i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if the product or service is distinct from other items in the bundle. The consideration is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the market prices at which the Group sells the mobile devices and telecommunications services separately. This could lead to the recognition of a contract asset – a receivable arising from the customer contract that has not yet legally come into existence – in the statement of financial position. The contract asset is amortized over the enforceable period. Enforceable period has been determined for each agreement. It represents the period over which rights and obligation are enforceable. This period is determined not only by the commitment period as stated in the contract, but also by business practices and contracts mechanisms (early renewal, exit options, penalties and other clauses). 2.3.1. _Revenues from the sale of equipment The Group recognises revenues when a customer takes possession of the device, which is the performance obligation. This usually occurs when the customer signs a new contract. The amount of revenue includes the sale of mobile devices and ancillary equipment for those devices. For mobile devices sold separately, customers pay in full at the point of sale or in several instalments (credit agreement). 2.3.2. _Revenues on separable components of bundle packages Revenues from telephone packages are recorded as a sale with multiple components. Revenues from sales of handsets (mobile phones and other) are recorded upon activation of the line, net of discounts granted to the customer via the point of sale and the costs of activation. When elements of these transactions cannot be identified or analysed separately from the main offer, they are considered as related elements and the associated revenues are recognised in full over the duration of the contract or the expected duration of the customer relationship. 2.3.3. _Revenue from service Revenues from subscriptions for basic cable services, digital television pay, Internet and telephony (fixed and mobile) are recognised in revenue on a straight-line basis over the subscription period; revenues from telephone calls are recognised in revenue when the service is rendered in accordance with the term of the contract. The Group sells certain telephone subscriptions based on plans under which the call minutes for a given month can be carried over to the next month if they are not used. The minutes carried over are recorded based on the proportion of total telephone subscription revenues they represent, when the minutes are used or when they expire. Revenues relative to incoming and outgoing calls and off-plan calls are recorded when the service is provided. Revenues generated by vouchers sold to distributors and by prepaid mobile cards are recorded each time use is made by the end customer, as from when the vouchers and cards are activated. Any unused portion is recorded in contract liabilities at the end of the reporting period. Revenues are in any case recognised upon the expiry date of the cards, or when the use of the vouchers is statistically unlikely. Sales of services to subscribers managed by the Group on behalf of content providers (principally special numbers and SMS+) are recorded on a gross basis, or net of repayments to the content providers when the content providers are responsible for the content and determine the pricing applied to the subscriber. The costs of access to the service or installation costs principally billed to operator and corporate clients in relation to DSL connection services, bandwidth services, and IP connectivity services, are recognised over the expected duration of the contractual relationship and the provision of the principal service. Installation service revenue is deferred and recognised over the benefit period. For business service subscribers, the benefit period is the contract term, which is defined and agreed for 2 years or more. For residential customers, there is no commitment period and installation costs are recognised over the estimated benefit period. ----- Revenues linked to switched services are recognised each time traffic is routed. Revenues from bandwidth, IP connectivity, high-speed local access and telecommunications services are recorded as and when the services are delivered to the customers. 2.3.4. _Access to telecommunications infrastructures The Group provides its operator clients with access to its telecommunications infrastructures by means of different types of contracts: rental, hosting contracts or concessions of Indefeasible Rights of Use (‘‘IRU’’). The IRU contracts grant the use of an asset (ducting, fibre optic or bandwidth) for a specified period. The Group remains the owner of the asset. Proceeds generated by rental contracts, hosting contracts in Netcenters, and infrastructure IRUs are recognised over the duration of the corresponding contracts, except where these are defined as a finance lease, in which case the equipment is considered as having been sold on credit. In the case of IRUs, and sometimes rentals or service agreements, the service is paid in advance in the first year. These prepayments, which are non-refundable, are recorded in prepaid income and recognised over the expected term of the related agreements. 2.3.5. _Sales of infrastructure The Group builds infrastructure on behalf of certain clients. The average duration of the construction work is less than one year; therefore, revenues are recorded when ownership is transferred. A provision is recognised when any contracts are expected to prove onerous. 2.3.6. _Advertising revenues Advertising revenues are recognised when commercials are aired. For revenue related to space to display video advertisements online sold either directly to clients or to advertising agencies (the clients), the Group generates revenue when a user clicks on the banner ad or views the advertisement. The Group prices the advertising campaigns on a cost per view (“CPV”) model or a cost per mille (“CPM”) model based on the number of views generated by users on each advertising campaign. Revenue is recognised when four basic criteria are met: - persuasive evidence exists of an arrangement with the client reflecting the terms and conditions under which the services will be provided (insertion order, which are commonly based on specified CPVs and related campaign budgets); - services have been provided or delivery has occurred. Income relating to services provided is recorded based on the stage of completion of the service. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the work performed at the reporting date. For on-going service agreements, the stage of completion is prorated over time. In case of negative margin for a campaign, accrual for future loss is booked. - the fee is fixed or determinable; and - collection is probable. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including the creditworthiness of a client, the size and nature of a client’s website and transaction history. Amounts billed or collected in excess of revenue recognised are included as deferred revenue. An example of such deferred revenue would be arrangements whereby clients request or are required by the Group to pay in advance of delivery. 2.3.7. _Income from credit arrangements Revenues deriving from long-term credit arrangements (such as the sale of devices in instalments) are recorded at the present value of the future cash flows (against long-term receivables) and are discounted in accordance with market interest rates. The difference between the original amount of the credit and the present value, as aforesaid, is spread over the length of the credit period and recorded as interest income over the length of the credit period. 2.3.8. _Gross versus net revenue recognition The Group determines whether it is acting as a principal or as an agent. The Group is acting as a principal if it controls a promised good or service before it is transferred to a customer. ----- Indicators for acting as a principal include: (1) the Group is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service, (2) the Group has inventory risk in the specified good or service and (3) the Group has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. On the other hand, the Group is acting as an agent or an intermediary, if these criteria are not met. When the Group is acting as an agent, revenue is presented on a net basis in the statement of income. When the Group is acting as principal, revenue is presented on a gross basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group from the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognised in profit or loss as incurred. At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value, except that: - deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 _Income Taxes and IAS 19_ _Employee Benefits respectively; - liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payments at the acquisition date; and - assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets _Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard._ Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain. Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Other types of non-controlling interests are measured at fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in the applicable IFRS standard. When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, in respect of: - the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; - the consideration transferred for the acquiree (or the other amount used in measuring goodwill); - in a business combination achieved in stages, the equity interest in the acquiree previously held by the acquirer; and ----- - the resulting goodwill or gain on a bargain purchase. The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, or IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and _Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss._ Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods. On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. _Acquisition under common control_ In the absence of specific guidance under IFRS for transactions between entities under common control, the Company considered and applied standards on business combination and transactions between entities under common control issued by the accounting standard-setting bodies in the United States (Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810-10-45-10 and Topic 810-10-55-1B Consolidation and SEC Regulation S-X Article 3A – _Consolidated and _Combined Financial Statements) and in the United Kingdom (FRS 6_ _Acquisitions and mergers) to prepare the_ consolidated financial statements.

Franchise rights are periodically reviewed to determine if each franchise has a finite life or an indefinite life in accordance with goodwill and other intangible asset financial accounting standards. Accordingly, the Company believes its franchises qualify for indefinite life treatment and are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances. Costs incurred in negotiating and renewing broadband franchises are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the renewal period. Other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually as well as where there is an indication that it may be impaired by comparing their carrying amount with their recoverable amount. Operating licenses for telephony services are recorded based on the fixed amount paid upon acquisition of the license. Investments made in the context of concessions or public service contracts, and linked to the rollout of the telecommunications network, are recorded in intangible assets in accordance with interpretation IFRIC 12 _Service _Concession Arrangements. The ‘‘intangible asset’’ model stipulated by this interpretation applies when the concession_ holder receives a right to bill users of the public service and the concession holder is essentially paid by the user. These intangible assets are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the categories of assets in question and the duration of the concession. Intangible assets also comprise rights of use or access rights obtained. Amortization is generally calculated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the contractual term and 30 years. Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs are capitalised as intangible assets when the following can be demonstrated: - the technical feasibility of the project and the availability of the adequate resources for the completion of the intangible assets; - the ability of the asset to generate future economic benefit; - the ability to measure reliably the expenditures attributable to the asset; and - the feasibility and intention of the Group to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it. _Content rights_ Exclusive sports broadcasting rights are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position from the point at which the legally enforceable licence period begins. Rights for which the licence period has not started are disclosed as contractual commitments in note 29. Payments made to acquire broadcasting rights in advance of the legal right to broadcast the programmes are classified as prepayments in the caption “other financial assets” in the statement of financial position. Broadcasting rights are initially recognised at cost and are amortised from the point at which they are available for use, on a straight-line basis over the broadcasting period. The amortisation charge is recorded in the caption “depreciation and amortisation” in the consolidated statement of income. The costs of exclusive in-house content and external content are recognised as an intangible asset.

Operating licenses for telephony services are recorded based on the fixed amount paid upon acquisition of the license. Investments made in the context of concessions or public service contracts, and linked to the rollout of the telecommunications network, are recorded in intangible assets in accordance with interpretation IFRIC 12 _Service _Concession Arrangements. The ‘‘intangible asset’’ model stipulated by this interpretation applies when the concession_ holder receives a right to bill users of the public service and the concession holder is essentially paid by the user. These intangible assets are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the categories of assets in question and the duration of the concession. Intangible assets also comprise rights of use or access rights obtained. Amortization is generally calculated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the contractual term and 30 years. Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs are capitalised as intangible assets when the following can be demonstrated: - the technical feasibility of the project and the availability of the adequate resources for the completion of the intangible assets; - the ability of the asset to generate future economic benefit; - the ability to measure reliably the expenditures attributable to the asset; and - the feasibility and intention of the Group to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it. _Content rights_ Exclusive sports broadcasting rights are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position from the point at which the legally enforceable licence period begins. Rights for which the licence period has not started are disclosed as contractual commitments in note 29. Payments made to acquire broadcasting rights in advance of the legal right to broadcast the programmes are classified as prepayments in the caption “other financial assets” in the statement of financial position. Broadcasting rights are initially recognised at cost and are amortised from the point at which they are available for use, on a straight-line basis over the broadcasting period. The amortisation charge is recorded in the ----- caption “depreciation and amortisation” in the consolidated statement of income. The costs of exclusive in-house content and external content are recognised as an intangible asset. The cost of the rights is recognised at the cost of production of the shows and is amortized based on the actual screenings.

The Group recognises rightof-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-ofuse assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, lease payments made at or before the commencement date and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.

All other financial assets are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The Group did not elect such a designation. Debt financial assets are subsequently measured at FVTPL, amortised cost, or FVOCI. The classification is based on two criteria: the Group’s business model for managing the assets; and whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows represent ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the principal amount outstanding (the ‘SPPI criterion’). The classification and measurement of the Group’s debt financial assets are, as follows: - Debt instruments at amortised cost for financial assets that are held within a business model with the objective to hold the financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows that meet the SPPI criterion. This category includes the Group’s Trade and other receivables, and Loans included under balance sheet caption “Financial assets” (non-current and current portion). - Debt instruments at FVOCI, with gains or losses recycled to profit or loss on derecognition. The Group has no instrument in this new category. ----- Other financial assets are classified and subsequently measured, as follows: - Equity instruments at FVOCI, with no recycling of gains or losses to profit or loss on derecognition. This category only includes equity instruments, which the Group intends to hold for the foreseeable future and which the Group has irrevocably elected to so classify upon initial recognition or transition. The Group classified its quoted and unquoted equity instruments as equity instruments at FVOCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment under IFRS 9. - Financial assets at FVTPL comprise derivative instruments. This category would also include debt instruments whose cash flow characteristics fail the SPPI criterion or are not held within a business model whose objective is either to collect contractual cash flows, or to both collect contractual cash flows and sell. Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains and losses arising on remeasurement recognised in the caption “Other Financial expense” or “Other Financial income” in the income statements. Under IFRS 9, embedded derivatives are not separated from a host financial asset. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met. _Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities_ Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. _Impairment of financial assets_ Under IFRS 9, accounting for impairment losses for financial assets is based on an expected credit loss (ECL) approach. IFRS 9 requires the Group to record an allowance for ECLs for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive. The shortfall is then discounted at an approximation to the asset’s original effective interest rate. For contract assets, trade and other receivables, the Group has applied the standard’s simplified approach and has calculated ECLs based on lifetime expected credit losses. The Group records provision for doubtful debt based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. _Call option granted to non-controlling interests_ The call options are derivative financial instruments that are stated at fair value and subsequently re-measured to their fair value at balance sheet date, with any gains and losses arising on remeasurement recognised in the caption “Other Financial expense” or “Other Financial income” in the income statement. Except for certain trade receivables, under IFRS 9, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Debt financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), amortised cost, or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

Financial assets at FVPL are stated at fair value, with any gains and losses arising on remeasurement recognised in the caption “Other Financial expense” or “Other Financial income” in the income statements. Under IFRS 9, embedded derivatives are not separated from a host financial asset. The assessment of the Group’s business models was made as of the date of initial application, January 1, 2018. The assessment of whether contractual cash flows on debt instruments are solely comprised of principal and interest was made based on the facts and circumstances as at the initial recognition of the assets. _Impairment of financial assets_ Under IFRS 9, accounting for impairment losses for financial assets is based on a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach.

All other financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities at amortized cost: 2.22.1. _Financial liabilities at amortized cost These financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost calculated based on the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the internal yield rate that exactly discounts future cash flows through the term of the financial liability. Fees, debt issuance and transaction costs are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate over the expected life of the instrument. 2.22.2. _Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at FVTPL if they are acquired for sale in the near term. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in profit or loss. Derivatives, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, are classified as financial liabilities at FVTPL unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. In the event of a financial instrument that contains one or more embedded derivatives, the entire combined instrument may be designated as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss only upon initial recognition.

Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required. The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in an active market is determined by reference to quoted market prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.

The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. ----- 2.27.1. _Critical accounting judgements The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are presented separately below), that the Board of Managers of the Company has made in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. - Revenue recognition Judgement and estimates are made for (i) the identification of the separable elements of a packaged offer and allocation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each element; (ii) the period of deferred revenues related to costs to access the service based on the type of product and the term of the contract; and (iii) presentation as net or gross revenues depending on whether the Group is acting as agent or principal. 2.27.2. _Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below. - Litigations In estimating the likelihood of outcome of claims filed against the Group and its investees and the estimated provision, the Group companies rely on the opinion of internal and/or external counsel. These estimates are based on the counsel’s best professional judgment, considering the stage of proceedings and historical precedents in respect of the different issues. Since the outcome of the claims will be determined via settlement or court’s decision, the results could differ from these estimates. - Post-employment benefits The liability in respect of post-employment defined benefit plans is determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about, among others, discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to uncertainty. - Fair value of financial instruments Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 Fair value is determined by reference to the market price at the end of the period, when the data is available. For financial instruments for which there is no active market such as interest rate swaps (which the Company currently may use to hedge its interest rate risk), call options and put options granted to non-controlling interests fair value is estimated based on models that rely on observable market data or using various valuation techniques, such as discounted future cash flows. - Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets relate primarily to tax loss carried forwards and to deductible temporary differences between reported amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The assets relating to the tax loss carried forwards are recognised if it is probable that the Group will generate future taxable profits against which these tax losses can be set off. Evaluation of the Group’s capacity to utilize tax loss carried forward relies on significant judgment. The Group analyses past events, and the positive and negative elements of certain economic factors that may affect its business in the foreseeable future to determine the probability of its future utilization of these tax losses carried forward. - Intangible assets and Property, plant and equipment Estimates of useful lives are based on the effective obsolescence of fixed assets and the use made of these assets. - Impairment of intangible assets At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. The recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not available for use on the reporting date, are measured at least on an annual basis, irrespective of whether any impairment indicators exist. ----- Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Board of Managers to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate to calculate present value. Where the actual future cash flows are less than expected, a material impairment loss may arise. - Impairment of contract assets and trade receivables For contract assets and trade receivables, the Group has applied the standard’s simplified approach and has calculated ECLs based on lifetime expected credit losses. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. - Determination of the right-of-use and lease liabilities The right-of-use and the lease liabilities are determined based on the lease term and the discount rate. - For the lease term, the Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. - The discount rate is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described above, the Board of Managers of the Company is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not clear from other sources.

(“Belmont”), that owns 100% of a tower company OMTEL, to Cellnex Telecom S.A.. Total cash proceeds amounted to €201.0 million. The total capital gain recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to €101.0 million (please refer to note 4.3.2.2). The sale by PT Portugal of its 25% equity interest in Belmont is part of a larger transaction pursuant to which Cellnex Telecom S.A. acquired 100% of the share capital of OMTEL. In September 2018, at the time of its sale of OMTEL to a consortium including Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and Horizon Equity Partners, PT Portugal had reinvested €108.8 million for a 25% equity interest in OMTEL. 3.1.2. _Closing of the partnership with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and the sale of 49.99% interest in _FastFiber (formerly known as Altice Portugal FTTH)_ On December 12, 2019, PT Portugal entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners regarding the sale of a 49.99% interest in the Portuguese fibre business to be carved-out into a dedicated wholesale vehicle, FastFiber (formerly known as Altice Portugal FTTH), comprising of the fibre passive infrastructure assets and rights, related contracts and underlying agreements, thereby creating a nationwide fibre wholesaler in Portugal. On April 17, 2020, the transaction was closed and the Group received €1,576.0 million of proceeds from this transaction, for the sale of 49.99% of the share capital of FastFiber (€773.3 million) and for the sale of 49.99% of the existing intercompany loan (€799.8 million), which was simultaneously converted into mandatory convertible notes (please refer to note 9.7.5). The proceeds from the transaction were partly used to further deleverage the Group’s debt (please refer to note 9.2). Furthermore, the Group recorded a receivable representing the net present value of an earnout of €375 million due December 2021. A second earnout is due in December 2026 subject to some performance conditions and the Company did not take into consideration this second earnout in the valuation of the purchase price and thus the capital gain recognized at closing of the transaction. Following the closing of the transaction, PT Portugal continues to control and fully consolidate FastFiber. The transaction resulted in the recognition of a non-controlling interest of ----- €4.0 million (please refer to note 3.4) and a gain of €1,111.5 million in equity.

The Group’s chief operating decision maker is the Board of Managers. The Board of Managers analyses the Group’s results across geographies, and certain key areas by activity. The presentation of the segments here is consistent with the reporting used internally by the Board of Managers to track the Group’s operational and financial performance. The businesses that the Group owns and operates do not show significant seasonality, except for the mobile residential and business services, which can show significant changes in sales at year end and at the end of the summer season (the “back to school” period). The business services are also impacted by the timing of preparation of the annual budgets of public and private sector companies. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies. The segments that are presented are detailed below: - **Portugal: The Group owns Portugal Telecom (“PT Portugal”), the largest telecom operator in Portugal. PT Portugal caters to fixed residential, mobile residential and business services clients using the MEO brand. This segment also includes the Altice Technical Services entities in Portugal. - **Israel: Fixed and mobile services are provided using the HOT telecom, HOT mobile and HOT net brands to residential and business services clients. HOT also produces award winning exclusive content that it distributes using its fixed network, as well as content application called Next and OTT services through Next Plus. This segment also includes the Altice Technical Services entity in Israel. - **Dominican Republic: The Group provides fixed residential, mobile residential and business services using the Altice brand.

The Board of Managers believes that these indicators offer them the best view of the operational and financial efficiency of each segment and this follows best practices in the rest of the industry, thus providing investors and other analysts a suitable base to perform their analysis of the Group’s results. ----- The financial KPIs tracked by the Board of Managers are: - Revenues: by segment and in terms of activity; - Adjusted EBITDA: by segment; - Capital expenditure (“Capex”): by segment; and - Operating free cash flow (“OpFCF”): by segment. 4.2.1. _Revenues Additional information on the revenue split is presented as follows: - Residential revenue `o` Fixed: revenues from fixed services to B2C customers; `o` Mobile: revenues from mobile services to B2C subscribers; `o` Equipment business to B2C subscribers; - Business services: revenues from B2B customers, wholesale and other revenues; and - Media: media revenues in Teads. Intersegment revenues represented 0.1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 0.2% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 (€4.2 million compared to €3.9 million). 4.2.2. _Non-Gaap measures Adjusted EBITDA, Capex and OpFCF are non-GAAP measures. These measures are useful to readers of the consolidated financial statements as they provide a measure of operating results excluding certain items that the Group’s management believe are either outside of its recurring operating activities, or items that are non cash. Excluding such items enables trends in the Group’s operating results and cash flow generation to be more easily observable. The non-GAAP measures are used by the Group internally to manage and assess the results of its operations, make decisions with respect to investments and allocation of resources, and assess the performance of management personnel. Such performance measures are also the de facto metrics used by investors and other members of the financial community to value other companies operating in the same industry as the Group and thus are a basis for comparability between the Group and its peers. Moreover, the debt covenants of the Group are based on the Adjusted EBITDA and other associated metrics. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA used in the covenants has not changed with the adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases by the Group. 4.2.2.1. _Adjusted EBITDA Following the application of IFRS 16 Leases, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, other expenses and income (capital gains, non-recurring litigation, restructuring costs) and sharebased expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IAS 17 Leases for operating leases). This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating income as the effects of depreciation, amortization and impairment, excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, do ultimately affect the operating results. Operating results presented in the consolidated financial statements are in accordance with IAS 1 _Presentation of Financial Statements._ 4.2.2.2. _Capex Capex is an important indicator to follow, as the profile varies greatly between activities: - The fixed business has fixed Capex requirements that are mainly discretionary (network, platforms, general), and variable capex requirements related to the connection of new customers and the purchase of Customer Premises Equipment (TV decoder, modem, etc.). - Mobile Capex is mainly driven by investment in new mobile sites, upgrade to new mobile technology and licenses to operate; once engaged and operational, there are limited further Capex requirements. - Other Capex is mainly related to costs incurred in acquiring content rights. ----- 4.2.2.3. _Operating free cash flow OpFCF is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capex. This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating cash flow as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with IAS 7 Statement of Cashflows.

For more details on the GCGUs, please refer to notes 2.7 and 2.9. Goodwill is tested at the level of each GCGU or CGU annually for impairment and whenever changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill was tested at the CGU/GCGU level for impairment as of December 31, 2020. The CGU/GCGU is at the country level where the subsidiaries operate. The recoverable amounts of the GCGUs are determined based on their value in use. The Group determined value in use for purposes of its impairment testing and, accordingly, did not determine the fair value less cost of disposal of the GCGUs. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are primarily the pre-tax discount rates, the terminal growth rate, revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures. Following the application of IFRS 16 Leases, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, other expenses and incomes (capital gains, nonrecurring litigation, restructuring costs) and share-based expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IAS 17 Leases for operating lease). The Board of Managers and the Group’s senior executives have determined that there have not been any changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. In addition, there were no significant changes in assets or liabilities in any CGU/GCGU, while the recoverable amounts continue to significantly ----- exceed the carrying amounts. Therefore, based on the annual impairment test performed as at December 31, 2020, no impairment of goodwill was recorded. 5.1.1. _Key assumptions used in impairment testing The Group has made use of various external indicators and internal reporting tools to assess and estimate the key assumptions used in the Group’s impairment testing for the year ended December 31, 2020. 5.1.1.1. _Cash flows The value in use of each GCGU was determined by estimating cash flows for a period of five years for the operating activities. Cash flow forecasts are derived from the most recent business plans approved by the Board of Managers. Beyond the specifically forecasted period of five years, the Company extrapolates cash flows for the remaining years based on an estimated constant growth rate between 1.0% - 4.0%. The growth rate is estimated at an individual GCGU level and does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. 5.1.1.2. _Discount rates Discount rates have been estimated using pre-tax rates, which reflect current market rates for investments of similar risk. The discount rate for the GCGUs was estimated using the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) of companies that operate a portfolio of assets similar to the Group’s.

These assumptions were based on historical experience and expectations of future changes in the market. The Group also assumes that recurring capex is expected to be proportional to sales, related to the acquisition of new clients, and thus is indexed to the growth in revenues. 5.1.1.4. _Assumptions about external factors In addition to using internal indicators to assess the carrying amount in use, the Board of Managers also relies on external factors which can influence the cash generating capacity of the CGUs or GCGUs and indicate that certain factors beyond the control of the Board of Managers might influence the carrying amounts in use: - Indicators of market slowdown in a country of operation, - Indicators of degradation in financial markets, that can impact the financing ability of the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

In addition, PT Portugal and some of its subsidiaries are also responsible for the payment of salaries to suspended and pre-retired employees until ----- retirement age. A detailed nature of these benefits is presented below: - Pension supplements - Retirees and employees of Companhia Portuguesa Rádio Marconi, S.A. (“Marconi”, a company merged into PT Portugal in 2002) hired prior to February 1, 1998 and retirees and employees of Telefones de Lisboa e Porto, S.A. (“TLP”, a company merged into PT in 1994) and Teledifusora de Portugal, S.A. (“TDP”, a company merged into PT in 1994) hired prior to June 23, 1994 are entitled to receive a supplemental pension benefit, which complements the pension paid by the Portuguese social security system. In addition, on retirement, PT Portugal pays a lump sum gratuity of a fixed amount which depends on the length of service completed by the employee and its salary. Employees hired by PT Portugal or any of its predecessor companies after the dates indicated above are not entitled to these benefits and are thus covered only by the general Portuguese Government social security system, which is a defined contribution plan in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits. - Healthcare benefits - PT Portugal sponsors the payment of post-retirement health care benefits to certain suspended employees, pre-retired employees and retired employees and their eligible relatives. Health care services are rendered by Altice - Associação de Cuidados de Saúde (“Altice ACS”), which was incorporated with the only purpose of managing this Health Care Plan. This plan, sponsored by MEO, includes all employees hired by MEO until December 31, 2000 and by Marconi until February 1, 1998. The financing of the Health Care Plan comprises defined contributions made by participants to Altice ACS and the remainder by MEO, which incorporated an autonomous fund in 2004 for this purpose. - Salaries to suspended and pre-retired employees - PT Portugal and some of its subsidiaries are also responsible for the payment of salaries to suspended and pre-retired employees until the retirement age, which result from agreements between both parties. These liabilities are not subject to any legal funding requirement and therefore the monthly payment of salaries is made directly by each of the subsidiaries of PT Portugal. 16.1.2. _Israel In Israel, the plans are normally financed by contributions to insurance companies and classified as defined contribution plans or as defined benefit plans. The Group has defined contribution plans pursuant to Section 14 of the Severance Pay Law under which the Group pays regular contributions and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient amounts to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. In addition, the Group has a defined benefit plan in respect of severance pay pursuant to the Severance Pay Law. According to the law, employees are entitled to receive severance pay upon dismissal or retirement. In respect of its severance pay obligation to certain of its employees, the Group makes current deposits in pension funds and insurance companies (the “plan assets""). Plan assets comprise assets held by a long-term employee benefit fund or qualifying insurance policies. Plan assets are not available to the Group’s own creditors and cannot be returned directly to the Group. 16.1.1. _Portugal PT Portugal sponsors defined benefit plans, under which it is responsible for the payment of pension supplements to retired and active employees and healthcare services to retired employees and eligible relatives.

The non-current portion of other financial liabilities amounts to €1,839.1 million as at December 31, 2020, an increase of €308.6 million compared to December 31, 2019. Details of the main items within the caption, and the movements from the prior period, are detailed below. 17.8.1. _Lease liabilities Leases relate to the current and non-current lease liabilities recorded in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases, which standard was adopted as from January 1, 2019. Please also refer to note 20. 17.8.2. _Reverse factoring Through the use of reverse factoring structures, the Group extends its payment terms up to 360 days, reducing its requirements for working capital. The contractual arrangements in place permit the supplier to obtain the amounts invoiced at agreed payment term with the amounts paid by the banks that participate in the reverse factoring structure. The Group will repay the banks the full invoice amount, with interest, on the scheduled payment date as required by ----- the reverse factoring agreement. Based on the scheduled payment dates, the amounts payable under this arrangement are accounted for as current liabilities. As the amounts are payable to the participating banks, the amounts have been presented under Other financial liabilities. In the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the cash flows related to reverse factoring are presented under Changes in working capital or Payments to acquire tangible and intangible assets depending on the nature of the expenditure, and Payments made to suppliers through factoring arrangements or Payments made to factoring companies relating to the net payment to the banks. The decrease in reverse factoring as at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 is due to the combination of timing of reverse factoring capacity with the banks. 17.8.3. _Accrued interest Accrued interest is the amount of interest due at balance sheet date regarding the Company’s outstanding debentures and loans from financial institutions. 17.8.4. _Put options with non-controlling interests The Group executes agreements with the non-controlling interests in certain acquisitions whereby the non-controlling interests have the option to sell their non-controlling interests to the Group. These instruments are measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date (please refer to note 19.1.2.3 for further information). 17.8.5. _Mandatory Convertible Notes On April 17, 2020, PT Portugal and Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners entered into a subscription agreement regarding the issuance and subscription of €1,600.0 million mandatory convertible notes in which the parties subscribed considering the percentage of interest in equity of FastFiber. The €848.8 million relates to the financial liability of the Group towards Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners, consisting of the notional amount of €799.8 million and an additional subscription of €49.0 million. The notes will bear interest on their aggregate principal amount at the fixed rate of 6.00% per annum. Interest is due in May and November of each year. At any time on or after the date that is twenty years after the date of issue, all or part of the notes issued can be converted into shares with mutual consent. The principle of the convertible notes do not have a stated maturity and will never become payable in cash. 17.8.6. _Mandatory Convertible Notes Altice Luxembourg The Mandatory Convertible Notes (“MCN”) were issued for an aggregate amount of €2,055 million, which were entirely subscribed by the Company’s sole shareholder, Altice Luxembourg. These instruments are compound financial instruments that contain both a liability and an equity component. On December 30, 2020, the existing agreement was amended with a revised maturity date of December 31, 2023 and an interest rate which is based on the annual interest rate accrued on the Company’s Senior Debt. Following the amended agreement, the existing liability was derecognized and a new liability was recorded, resulting in the recognition of an interest expense of €17.9 million and an extinguishment of debt of €478.3 million. The non-current portion of the MCN liability recorded at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are €174.0 million and €489.9 million respectively. The current portion of the MCN liability recorded at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are €180.0 million and €139.9 million respectively. 17.8.7. _Debt and liabilities with Altice Group companies Debts and liabilities with Altice Group companies relate to debts and liabilities which the Company has with Altice Group companies outside of the Group (please refer to note 28 for further information). 17.8.8. _Other Other consists mainly of various other debts and liabilities of the Altice Group. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The credit risk may arise from the exposures of commitments under a number of financial instruments with one body or as the result of commitments with a number of groups of debtors with similar economic characteristics, whose ability to meet their commitments could be similarly affected by economic or other changes. The Group accounting for impairment losses for financial assets is based on a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. IFRS 9 requires the Group to record an allowance for ECLs for all loans and other financial assets not held at FVTPL. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive. The shortfall is then discounted at an approximation to the asset’s original effective interest rate. For contract assets, trade and other receivables, the Group has applied the standard’s simplified approach and has calculated ECLs based on lifetime expected credit losses. The Group records expected credit losses based on the ----- Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. The Group’s income mainly derives from customers in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic. The Group regularly monitors its customers’ debts and expected credit losses are recorded in the consolidated financial statements, which provide a fair value of the loss that is inherent to debts whose collection lies in doubt. Additionally, retail customers represent a major portion of revenues and these clients generally pay in advance for the services they buy, or in more significant regions, retail customers generally pay using direct debit, a practice that reduces the Group’s credit risk. The expected credit losses on the financial assets of €2,769.7 million is deemed not material. Please also refer to note 10 for Financial assets and note 12 for Trade and other receivables. The Group does not have significant concentrations of credit risk.

The Group’s objective when managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Managers, which manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserves borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Group has a strong track record of driving operating free cash flow generation and specializes in turning around struggling businesses and optimizing the cash generation of existing businesses.

When it can, the Group endeavours to issue fixed rate debt (which also typically offers longer maturities). The Group has entered into different hedging contracts to manage interest rate risk related to debt instruments with variable interest rates. Please see note 17.4 for more information. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the impact of an increase of interest rates applicable to floating rate debt: a Euribor/Libor rate increase by 1 percentage point would result in an additional annual interest expense of €9.0 million. ----- 18.3.2. _Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk from transactions and translation. Transactional exposures are managed within a prudent and systematic hedging policy in accordance with the Company’s specific business needs. Translation exposure arises from the consolidation of the financial statements of foreign operations in euros, which is, in principle, not hedged. The Group’s objective is to manage its foreign currency exposure using currency forwards, futures and swaps. The Group estimates that a 10% variation of foreign currencies against euro parity is a relevant change of variables and reasonably possible risk in any given year. The table below provides the assessment of the impact of a 10% change in foreign currencies against euro on net result and reserves.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Investments in listed entities Quoted prices directly available from an active market are used to source the fair value, i.e. the quoted share price of the listed investments in Partner Co. These valuations are directly observable in an open market and therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 19.1.2.2. Derivative financial instruments Future cash flows are estimated using market observable data at the end of the reporting period (namely, forward exchange rates and interest rates) and the contracted rates of the derivative discounted at a rate that reflects the counterparty credit risk. Since model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgement, the Company has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 19.1.2.3. Put options Each contract has specific terms and conditions, and the valuation is performed using the contracted terms and assessment against market comparable information where appropriate. For example, the exercise price in the option may be determined based on an EBITDA multiple minus the net financial debt. In all instances, the probabilities of the option being exercised is determined using management’s best estimate and judgement. The resulting fair value is discounted using appropriate discount rates of the related funding pool. These models use a variety of inputs that use judgements not able to be verified externally, therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 19.1.2.4. Call options The valuation is derived by calculating the intrinsic value, being the difference in the value of the underlying asset and the options exercise price, and time value of the option, which accounts for the passage of time until the option expires. Various inputs are used, including the price of the underlying asset and its volatility, the strike price and maturity in the contract, and the risk-free rate and dividend yield. The model calculates the possible prices of the underlying asset and their respective probability of occurrence, given these inputs. These models use a variety of inputs that use judgements not able to be verified externally, therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The Group does not believe that the unrecognised deferred tax losses can be used given the Group’s current structure, but the Group will continue exploring opportunities to offset these against any future profits that the Company or its subsidiaries may generate. Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Group's future deductible temporary differences and NOLs. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is probable that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating the recognition of deferred tax assets, management takes into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Group may be required to adjust its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income tax expense in the consolidated income statement.

The provision covers risks related mainly to the potential return of tax credits/incentives and VAT on indemnities charged as result of the breach of loyalty contracts entered with post-paid customers. The VAT contingency relates to both the fixed and mobile businesses and covers years since 2012. The claim for the VAT of the mobile company in 2012 was being discussed in an arbitral court, which decided to send the matter to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), that issued a decision on November 22, 2018 which was not favourable to MEO, concluding that, under certain circumstances, indemnities should be charged with VAT, and at the same time referring that ultimately VAT should only be assessed based on indemnities received from customers. The tax assessments of the fixed-line company in 2012 and both the mobile and fixed-line companies in 2013 and 2014, were submitted to the arbitral court as well, and all were suspended and waited for the decision of the ECJ. Following the ECJ decision, MEO was notified of the arbitral court decisions on all actions relating to the fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014, all of which unfavourable and some referring that VAT should only be assessed based on indemnities received from customers, which is less than 20% of the overall indemnities invoiced. MEO appealed from all these decisions to the Administrative Central Court, the decisions of which are not yet know. For the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 MEO reached an agreement with the tax authorities resulting in the payment of approximately €3 million. For the following years, it is not certain that the tax authorities will accept similar agreements. 23.5.2. _Israel On July 4, 2019, HOT signed a compromise agreement with the Israeli tax authorities for an amount of €7.6 million related to tax assessment for the years 2015 and 2016. 23.5.3. _Other tax jurisdictions Tax assessments are conducted in several tax jurisdictions within the Group (Israel and Luxembourg).

1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,300,REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE,300.323,30.1.** **Portugal,300.323.1,,"30.1.1. _European Commission Investigation After having approved the acquisition of PT Portugal by the Group on April 20, 2015, the European Commission initiated an investigation into infringement by Altice Europe of the obligation of prior notification of concentrations under Article 4(1) of the Merger Regulation and/or of the stand-still obligation laid down in Article 7(1) of the Merger Regulation. The European Commission issued a statement of objections on May 18, 2017, informing Altice Europe of the objections raised against it. On April 24, 2018, the European Commission notified Altice Europe of its decision to impose upon it two fines totalling €124.5 million. The Commission found that Altice Europe infringed the prior notification obligation of a concentration under Article 4(1) of the EU Merger Regulation, and the stand-still obligation under Article 7(1) of the EU Merger Regulation. Altice Europe fully disagrees with the Commission's decision, and in particular, it considers that this case differs entirely from the French Numéricable/Altice France/Virgin gun jumping case, in which the Altice Group had agreed not to challenge the allegations brought against it. In Altice Europe’s opinion, the Commission's decision relies on a wrongful definition of the notion of ""implementation"" of a concentration. Further, the transaction agreement governing the management of the target during the pre-closing period provided Altice Europe with a consultation right on certain exceptional matters relating to PT Portugal aimed at preserving the value and integrity of the target prior to closing and was in accordance with well-established M&A market practice. In any event, Altice Europe considers that the elements in the Commission's file do not establish the exercise of influence, as alleged by the Commission, by Altice Europe over PT Portugal's business conduct neither prior to the merger notification to the Commission nor prior to the Commission's clearance. On July 5, 2018, Altice Europe filed an Application for annulment against the Commission's decision before the EU General Court to request that the decision as a whole be annulled or, at the very least, that the sanction be significantly reduced (Case T-425/18). The Commission's decision does not affect the approval granted by the European Commission on April 20, 2015 for the acquisition of PT Portugal by the Group. On November 6, 2018, the Council of the European Union filed an Application to intervene in the case before the EU General Court. Both Altice Europe and the European Commission confirmed they had no observations to the Council’s Application to intervene. The Council requested an extension of the time-limit to file its Statement of intervention. The Court granted that extension until February 25, 2019. On November 30, 2018, the European Commission filed its Defence requesting the Court (1) to dismiss Altice Europe’s Application and (2) to order Altice Europe to pay the costs. The said Defence was notified to Altice Europe on December 14, 2018. On December 20, 2018, Altice Europe requested an extension of one month to lodge its Reply. The extension was granted on January 4, 2019, until February 25, 2019. On February 25, 2019, Altice Europe filed its Reply to the Commission’s Defence adhering to the conclusions and orders sought in its Application for annulment. On March 15, 2019, Altice Europe filed its observations on the Statement of intervention of the Council of the European Union, which essentially mirror the corresponding allegations in Altice Europe’s Application and reply to the Commission’s defence. On March 18, 2019, Altice Europe received the copy of the Commission’s observations on the Statement of intervention of the Council of the European Union, which merely state it does not have any observations, as its position and that of the Council of the European Union are aligned. After an extension of the deadline, the Commission filed its Rejoinder to Altice Europe’s reply on May 10, 2019. ----- The written phase of the procedure was closed. The President fixed a date on which the Judge-Rapporteur was to present a preliminary report to the General Court. Altice Europe submitted a reasoned request for a hearing on May 29, 2019. On March 10, 2020, Altice Europe received from the General Court an invitation addressed to all the parties to submit observations regarding the possible consequences of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) judgment on another case by March 25, 2020. On March 25, 2020, Altice Europe lodged its observations and reiterated its submission filed on May 29, 2019, regarding the importance of a hearing in the present case. On March 23, 2020, the Commission and the Council of the European Union lodged their observations, which have been transmitted to Altice Europe on March 31, 2020. In essence, the Commission and the Council concluded by reiterating that Altice Europe’s application should be rejected. On June 3, 2020, Altice Europe received the decision from the General Court to open the oral part of the procedure. The hearing took place on September 24, 2020. On July 21, 2020, Altice Europe received the report for the hearing prepared by the Judge-Rapporteur summarizing the facts relied on and the arguments of each party and of the Council as the intervener. On October 5, 2020, Altice Europe sent a letter to the General Court with some observations to respond to a question posed by the Judge Rapporteur during the Hearing. On November 16, 2020, Altice Europe received the decision from the General Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure, to hear the other parties on Altice Europe’s observations and to request the Commission to produce certain documents. On December 10, 2020, Altice Europe received a copy of the Commission’s and the Council’s responses. It was invited by the General Court to submit any observations it might have on the Commission’s reply. On January 7, 2021, Altice Europe sent its observations to the Commission’s reply. On January 12, 2021, Altice Europe received the decision from the General Court to close the oral part of the procedure. Altice Europe would expect a judgment in the first half of 2021. As of December 31, 2020, a liability of €129.1 million (including accrued interest) is recorded at Altice Portugal, as it is the acquiring entity of PT Portugal. On July 25, 2018, the Altice Group issued a bank guarantee to the European Commission of €124.5 million (excluding accrued interest). 30.1.2. _Vodafone – Network Sharing Agreement Vodafone and PT Comunicações (currently MEO) signed, on July 21, 2014, an agreement for the acquisition of exclusive rights of use of the PON Network, which consisted in the possibility of access to the installed infrastructure owned by each of the parties to offer new generation services and integrated offerings (voice, internet and television) autonomously in the retail market. On November 4, 2015, MEO informed Vodafone that it has decided to individually develop a new, ambitious plan for the expansion of its fibre optic network, both in geographical areas already covered by a new generation network and in other geographical areas, while continuing to comply with the agreed. Notwithstanding, Vodafone states that this was a breach of the agreement and is claiming an amount of approximately €132 million from MEO for damages and losses allegedly caused by that non-compliance with the agreed. MEO submitted its defence to these claims in June 2018, stating that (i) Vodafone did not have a contractual right to prevent MEO from developing its network autonomously and independently from the agreement, (ii) all of Vodafone rights, resulting from the agreement, were respected by MEO, and Vodafone was in no way limited by MEO in the investment in the construction of its own network, which it developed freely and voluntarily, choosing to invest where it found greater profitability for its business, and (iii) Vodafone´s claims for damages and losses were not factually sustainable. A preliminary hearing took place in February 2019, following the Court asked experts to review information provided by Vodafone supporting its alleged damages and losses. The experts' report has been submitted to the Court, which in ----- summary concludes that there are not enough elements allowing, with a certain level of reliability, to validate the amounts requested by Vodafone. At this stage, both parties are waiting for the Court to schedule the trial date. 30.1.3. _Optimus (currently NOS Comunicações) - Interconnection agreement This legal action is dated from 2001 and relates to the price that Telecomunicações Móveis Nacionais (“TMN”, PT Portugal’s mobile operation at that time) charged Optimus - Comunicações S.A. (“Optimus”, one of MEO’s mobile competitors at that time, currently NOS) for mobile interconnection services, price that Optimus did not agree with. TMN transferred to PT Comunicações (PT Portugal’s fixed operation at that time, currently named MEO) the receivables from Optimus, and subsequently PT Comunicações offset those receivables with payables due to Optimus. NOS argues for the annulment of the offset made by PT Comunicações and accordingly claims from PT Comunicações the settlement of the payables due before the offset plus accrued interest. In August 2015, the Court decided that the transfer of the interconnection receivables from TMN to PT Comunicações and consequently the offset of those receivables with payables due by PT Comunicações to Optimus were not legal and therefore sentenced MEO to settle those payables plus interest up to date in the total amount of approximately €35 million. MEO appealed this decision in October 2015 to the Court of Appeal of Lisbon. In September 2016, MEO was notified of the decision from the Court of Appeal of Lisbon, which confirmed the initial ruling against MEO, as a result of which MEO decided to appeal to the Supreme Court. On March 13, 2017, MEO was notified of the Supreme Court’s decision of dismissal of its appeal and as a result MEO decided to appeal to the Constitutional Court. In January 8, 2018, MEO was notified of the Constitutional Court decision of dismissal of the appeal, after which MEO appealed to the Constitutional Court Conference. MEO was notified that the Constitutional Court Conference did not accept and consequently will not analyse the appeal. In July 2018, MEO paid €41 million to settle the action which had been accrued for in 2015. NOS claimed an additional amount of interests during the judicial procedure and is now claiming an additional payment of €5 million. The contestation of the legal action by MEO was submitted in February 2019. On May 8, 2020, MEO received the first instance sentence that totally absolves MEO of the request by NOS. NOS appealed to Higher Court that decided, on January 15, 2021, to condemn MEO in the total amount requested by NOS. MEO will appeal to the Supreme Court. 30.1.4. _Anacom litigation MEO has several outstanding proceedings filed from Anacom, for some of which MEO has not yet received formal condemnations. This litigation includes matters such as the violation of rules relating to portability, TDT, the noncompliance of obligations under the universal service (public phones) and regulated offers (ORAC). Historically, MEO paid amounts significantly lower than the administrative fines set by Anacom in final decisions. The initial value of the proceedings is normally set at the maximum applicable amount of the administrative fine until the final decision is formally issued. 30.1.5. _Zon TV Cabo Portugal – Violation of portability rules Zon TV Cabo Portugal (currently NOS) claims that MEO has not complied with the applicable rules for the portability of fixed numbers, as a result of which claims for an indemnity of €22 million corresponding to profits lost due to unreasonable rejections and the delay in providing the portability of the number. An expert indicated by each party and a third-party expert evaluated this matter and presented the final report to the Court, which decided to change the scope of the work to be performed by the experts, and accordingly the action moved back again. The experts presented the new final report to the Court in January 2019 and the final Court hearing is scheduled in April, 2021. 30.1.6. _Municipal taxes and rights-of-way Pursuant to a statute enacted on August 1, 1997, as an operator of a basic telecommunications network, MEO was exempt from municipal taxes and rights-of-way and other fees with respect to its network in connection with its obligations under the Concession. The Portuguese Government has advised MEO in the past that this statute confirmed the tax exemption under MEO’s former Concession and that it will continue to take the necessary actions in order for MEO to maintain the economic benefits contemplated by the former Concession. Law 5/2004, dated 10 February 2004, established a new rights-of-way regime in Portugal whereby each municipality may establish a fee, up to a maximum of 0.25% of each wireline services bill, to be paid by the customers of those wireline operators which network infra-structures are located in each such municipality. Meanwhile, Decree-Law 123/2009, dated 21 May 2009, clarified that no other tax should be levied by the municipalities in addition to the tax established by Law 5/2004. This interpretation was confirmed by the Supreme Administrative Court of Portugal in ----- several legal actions. Some municipalities continue to perceive that the Law 5/2004 does not expressly revoke other taxes that the municipalities wish to establish, because Law 5/2004 is not applicable to the public municipality domain. Currently, there are legal actions with some municipalities regarding this matter and some of the municipalities have initiated enforcement proceedings against MEO to demand the payment of those taxes. 30.1.7. _National Commission for Data Protection MEO has several outstanding proceedings filed by the National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD), for some of which MEO has not yet received formal condemnations. This litigation includes matters such as the violation of rules relating to marketing contact with clients and alleged non-compliance of obligations under the database of debtors to telecom operators. Historically, MEO paid significantly lower (or even no amounts) of the administrative fines set by CNPD in final decisions. The initial value of the proceedings is normally set at the maximum applicable amount of the administrative fine until the final decision is formally issued. 30.1.8. _Portuguese Competition Authority investigation On December 20, 2019, MEO has received a Statement of Objections from the Portuguese Competition Authority regarding its preliminary view that both MEO and NOWO, which operates as a MVNO using MEO’s network, were part of a cartel for market sharing and price fixing of mobile services, sold either on a standalone basis or in bundles of fixed and mobile telecommunications services. The Competition Authority concluded that this alleged illegal practice took place between 2017 and 2018. MEO firmly denies the existence of any cartel. On February 19, 2020, MEO has submitted its written defence to the Statement of Objections, after which the Portuguese Competition Authority will decide whether to issue a condemnatory decision and in that case the amount of the fine. The decision to impose a fine will end the administrative procedure with MEO having the possibility of challenging this decision in court. On 3 December 2020, the PCA notified MEO of its decision to impose upon it a fine of €84 million for market sharing and price fixing of mobile and fixed telecommunications services with NOWO. MEO fully disagrees with the PCA’s unexpected. On January 18, 2021, MEO filed a judicial appeal against the decision before the Competition, Supervision and Regulation Court to request the decision to be annulled and to be acquitted of all charges. The risk associated with this contingency was classified as possible and accordingly no provision was recorded as of December 31, 2020. 30.1.9. _Portuguese Competition Authority investigation – Google AdWords On July 16, 2020, the Portuguese Competition Authority issued a Statement of Objections regarding its preliminary view that MEO, NOS – Comunicações, S.A. NOWO – Communications, S.A. and Vodafone Portugal – Comunicações Pessoas, S.A. were part of an agreement in accordance with which all those entities would not bid for certain key Google AdWords of the other operators, which in accordance with the Competition Authority is similar to an agreement to indirectly fix the acquisition price of certain Google AdWords related to the retail telecommunications market. The Competition Authority concluded that telecommunications operators distorted competition of the Portuguese online search advertising, between 2010 and 2018 in the case of MEO. The maximum fine applicable for this kind of infraction corresponds to 10% of the entity’s turnover. MEO submitted its written defense to the Statement of Objections on October 2, 2020 and will wait for the Portuguese Competition Authority decision. Due to the early stage of the process and little previous background in similar cases, management determined that it is difficult to reliably estimate the probability of the outcome of this case at this time, but it also believes that it is not more likely than not that an outflow of economic resources will be required with regards to this Statement of Objections from the Portuguese Competition Authority. As such, no provision was recognized as of December 31, 2020. 30.1.1. _European Commission Investigation After having approved the acquisition of PT Portugal by the Group on April 20, 2015, the European Commission initiated an investigation into infringement by Altice Europe N.V. (“Altice Europe”) of the obligation of prior notification of concentrations under Article 4(1) of the Merger Regulation and/or of the stand-still obligation laid down in Article 7(1) of the Merger Regulation. The European Commission issued a statement of objections on May 18, 2017, informing Altice Europe of the objections raised against it. On April 24, 2018, the European Commission notified Altice Europe of its decision to impose upon it two fines totalling €124.5 million. The Commission found that Altice Europe infringed the prior notification obligation of a concentration under Article 4(1) of the EU Merger Regulation, and the stand-still obligation under Article 7(1) of the EU Merger Regulation. Altice Europe fully disagrees with the Commission's decision, and in particular, it considers that this case differs entirely from the French Numéricable/Altice France/Virgin gun jumping case, in which the Group had agreed not to challenge the allegations brought against it. In Altice Europe's opinion, the Commission's decision relies on a wrongful definition of the notion of ""implementation"" of a concentration. Further, the transaction agreement governing the management of the target during the pre-closing period provided Altice Europe with a consultation right on certain exceptional matters relating to PT Portugal aimed at preserving the value and integrity of the target prior to closing and was in accordance with well-established M&A market practice. In any event, Altice Europe considers that the elements in the Commission's file do not establish the exercise of influence, as alleged by the Commission, by Altice Europe over PT Portugal's business conduct neither prior to the merger notification to the Commission nor prior to the Commission's clearance. On July 5, 2018, Altice Europe filed an Application for annulment against the Commission's decision before the EU General Court to request that the decision as a whole be annulled or, at the very least, that the sanction be significantly reduced (Case T-425/18). The Commission's decision does not affect the approval granted by the European Commission on April 20, 2015 for the acquisition of PT Portugal by the Group. On November 6, 2018, the Council of the European Union filed an Application to intervene in the case before the EU General Court. Both Altice Europe and the European Commission confirmed they had no observations to the Council’s Application to intervene. The Council requested an extension of the time-limit to file its Statement of intervention. The Court granted that extension until February 25, 2019. On November 30, 2018, the European Commission filed its Defence requesting the Court (1) to dismiss Altice Europe’s Application and (2) to order Altice Europe to pay the costs. The said Defence was notified to Altice Europe on December 14, 2018. On December 20, 2018, Altice Europe requested an extension of one month to lodge its Reply. The extension was granted on January 4, 2019, until February 25, 2019. On February 25, 2019, Altice Europe filed its Reply to the Commission’s Defence adhering to the conclusions and orders sought in its Application for annulment. On March 15, 2019, Altice Europe filed its observations on the Statement of intervention of the Council of the European Union, which essentially mirror the corresponding allegations in Altice Europe’s Application and reply to the Commission’s defence. On March 18, 2019, Altice Europe received the copy of the Commission’s observations on the Statement of intervention of the Council of the European Union, which merely state it does not have any observations, as its position and that of the Council of the European Union are aligned. After an extension of the deadline, the Commission filed its Rejoinder to Altice Europe’s reply on May 10, 2019. The written phase of the procedure has now been closed. The President will fix a date on which the Judge-Rapporteur is to present a preliminary report to the General Court. The preliminary report shall contain an analysis of the relevant issues of fact and of law raised by the action, proposals as to whether measures of organization of procedure or measures of inquiry should be undertaken, whether there should be an oral part of the procedure and whether the case should be referred to the Grand Chamber or to a Chamber sitting with a different number of Judges. Altice Europe submitted a reasoned request for a hearing on May 29, 2019. ----- On March 10, 2020, Altice Europe received from the General Court an invitation addressed to all the parties to submit observations regarding the possible consequences of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) judgment on another case by March 25, 2020. On March 25, 2020, Altice Europe lodged its observations and reiterated its submission filed on May 29, 2019, regarding the importance of a hearing in the present case. On March 23, 2020, the Commission and the Council of the European Union lodged their observations, which have been transmitted to Altice Europe on March 31, 2020. In essence, the Commission and the Council concluded by reiterating that Altice Europe’s application should be rejected. Depending on the Court’s evaluation of the observations received from the parties on the relevance of such judgment from the CJEU for Altice Europe's case, the General Court will decide whether or not to hold an oral hearing, which would most likely take place in 2020. In that case, Altice Europe would expect a judgment in 2021. As of December 31, 2019, a liability of €127.2 million (including accrued interests) is recorded at Altice Portugal, as it is the acquiring entity of PT Portugal. On July 25, 2018, the Group issued a bank guarantee to the European Commission of €124.5 million (excluding accrued interests). 30.1.2. _Vodafone – Network Sharing Agreement Vodafone and PT Comunicações (currently MEO) signed, on July 21, 2014, an agreement for the acquisition of exclusive rights of use of the PON Network, which consisted in the possibility of access to the installed infrastructure owned by each of the parties to offer new generation services and integrated offerings (voice, internet and television) autonomously in the retail market. On November 4, 2015, MEO informed Vodafone that it has decided to individually develop a new, ambitious plan for the expansion of its fibre optic network, both in geographical areas already covered by a new generation network and in other geographical areas, while continuing to comply with the agreed. Notwithstanding, Vodafone states that this was a breach of the agreement and is claiming an amount of approximately €132 million from MEO for damages and losses allegedly caused by that non-compliance with the agreed. MEO submitted its defence to these claims in June 2018, stating that (i) Vodafone did not have a contractual right to prevent MEO from developing its network autonomously and independently from the agreement, (ii) all of Vodafone rights, resulting from the agreement, were respected by MEO, and Vodafone was in no way limited by MEO in the investment in the construction of its own network, which it developed freely and voluntarily, choosing to invest where it found greater profitability for its business, and (iii) Vodafone´s claims for damages and losses were not factually sustainable. An experts’ report should be submitted to the Court and the experts asked the Court for a 45 days extension for the report submission, so the report should be submitted in April 2020. MEO will wait for the notification from the Court for analysis and response with respect to the experts’ report. 30.1.3. _Optimus (currently NOS Comunicações) - Interconnection agreement This legal action is dated from 2001 and relates to the price that Telecomunicações Móveis Nacionais (“TMN”, PT Portugal’s mobile operation at that time) charged Optimus - Comunicações S.A. (“Optimus”, one of MEO’s mobile competitors at that time, currently NOS) for mobile interconnection services, price that Optimus did not agree with. TMN transferred to PT Comunicações (PT Portugal’s fixed operation at that time, currently named MEO) the receivables from Optimus, and subsequently PT Comunicações offset those receivables with payables due to Optimus. NOS argues for the annulment of the offset made by PT Comunicações and accordingly claims from PT Comunicações the settlement of the payables due before the offset plus accrued interest. In August 2015, the Court decided that the transfer of the interconnection receivables from TMN to PT Comunicações and consequently the offset of those receivables with payables due by PT Comunicações to Optimus were not legal and therefore sentenced MEO to settle those payables plus interest up to date in the total amount of approximately €35 million. MEO appealed this decision in October 2015 to the Court of Appeal of Lisbon. In September 2016, MEO was notified of the decision from the Court of Appeal of Lisbon, which confirmed the initial ruling against MEO, as a result of which MEO decided to appeal to the Supreme Court. On March 13, 2017, MEO was notified of the Supreme Court’s decision of dismissal of its appeal and as a result MEO decided to appeal to the Constitutional Court. In January 8, 2018, MEO was notified of the Constitutional Court decision of dismissal of the appeal, after which MEO appealed to the Constitutional Court Conference. MEO was notified that the Constitutional Court Conference did not accept and consequently will not analyse the appeal. In July 2018, MEO paid €41 million to settle the action which had been accrued for in 2015. ----- NOS claimed an additional amount of interests during the judicial procedure and is now claiming an additional payment of €5 million. The contestation of the legal action by MEO was submitted and preliminary hearing should be scheduled. 30.1.4. _Anacom litigation MEO has several outstanding proceedings filed from Anacom, for some of which MEO has not yet received formal condemnations. This litigation includes matters such as the violation of rules relating to portability, TDT, the noncompliance of obligations under the universal service (public phones) and regulated offers (ORAC). Historically, MEO paid amounts significantly lower than the administrative fines set by Anacom in final decisions. The initial value of the proceedings is normally set at the maximum applicable amount of the administrative fine until the final decision is formally issued. 30.1.5. _Zon TV Cabo Portugal – Violation of portability rules Zon TV Cabo Portugal (currently NOS) claims that MEO has not complied with the applicable rules for the portability of fixed numbers, as a result of which claims for an indemnity of €22 million corresponding to profits lost due to unreasonable rejections and the delay in providing the portability of the number. An expert indicated by each party and a third-party expert evaluated this matter and presented the final report to the Court, which decided to change the scope of the work to be performed by the experts, and accordingly the action moved back again. The experts presented the new final report to the Court in January 2019 and the parties are waiting for the appointment date of the preliminary hearing. 30.1.6. _Municipal taxes and rights-of-way Pursuant to a statute enacted on August 1, 1997, as an operator of a basic telecommunications network, MEO was exempt from municipal taxes and rights-of-way and other fees with respect to its network in connection with its obligations under the Concession. The Portuguese Government has advised MEO in the past that this statute confirmed the tax exemption under MEO’s former Concession and that it will continue to take the necessary actions in order for MEO to maintain the economic benefits contemplated by the former Concession. Law 5/2004, dated 10 February 2004, established a new rights-of-way regime in Portugal whereby each municipality may establish a fee, up to a maximum of 0.25% of each wireline services bill, to be paid by the customers of those wireline operators which network infra-structures are located in each such municipality. Meanwhile, Decree-Law 123/2009, dated 21 May 2009, clarified that no other tax should be levied by the municipalities in addition to the tax established by Law 5/2004. This interpretation was confirmed by the Supreme Administrative Court of Portugal in several legal actions. Some municipalities continue to perceive that the Law 5/2004 does not expressly revoke other taxes that the municipalities wish to establish, because Law 5/2004 is not applicable to the public municipality domain. Currently, there are legal actions with some municipalities regarding this matter and some of the municipalities have initiated enforcement proceedings against MEO to demand the payment of those taxes. 30.1.7. _Invesfundo II - Disposal of plots of land Invesfundo II, acquired from one of MEO’s former pension fund assets, has a group of plots of land for a total amount of €41 million, including one plot of land that Invesfundo II argues was not MEO’s property, as a result of which Invesfundo II had to acquire that plot of land from a third party for €4 million, amount that is claiming from MEO. Judicial decision was totally favourable to MEO and the process was finalized in December 2019. 30.1.8. _Opway– Construction of Covilhã data centre In connection with construction of a data centre in Covilhã, PT Data Center had contracted Opway-Somague consortium as its main contractor responsible for the project, while Opway-Somague contracted Isolux as a subcontractor. Isolux filed an action against the Opway-Somague consortium for alleged delays in the construction works and changes to the initial project that resulted in higher costs for Isolux. The amount of this action is approximately €17.4 million. PT Data Center is only an accessory intervener in this action and thus no amount can be directly claim from it as a result of this action. Following the action filed by Isolux, the Opway-Somague consortium filed an action against PT Data Center in late 2016 for an amount of €16.7 million, claiming that PT Data Center orientations caused changes to the work plan and other vicissitudes in the realization of the construction plan that were never paid and caused damages to the Opway-Somague consortium. ----- By an extra judicial agreement between Opway and PT Data Center, closed in December 2018, with a broader scope than the facts that were being discussed in the judicial process, it was possible to close all the issues that involved the construction of the Covilhã data centre and the final reception of the contract took place. PT Data Center made a single payment, in face of the commitment of both parties that there was nothing more to claim from each other, and that they would desist from all legal proceedings. The process has been finalized since the beginning of February 2019, as the request by Opway to the Court for the process to be terminated occurred. 30.1.9. _National Commission for Data Protection MEO has several outstanding proceedings filed by the National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD), for some of which MEO has not yet received formal condemnations. This litigation includes matters such as the violation of rules relating to marketing contact with clients and alleged non-compliance of obligations under the database of debtors to telecom operators. Historically, MEO paid significantly lower (or even no amounts) of the administrative fines set by CNPD in final decisions. The initial value of the proceedings is normally set at the maximum applicable amount of the administrative fine until the final decision is formally issued. 30.1.10. Portuguese Competition Authority investigation On December 20, 2019, MEO has received a Statement of Objections from the Portuguese Competition Authority regarding its preliminary view that both MEO and NOWO, which operates as a MVNO using MEO’s network, were part of a cartel for market sharing and price fixing of mobile services, sold either on a standalone basis or in bundles of fixed and mobile telecommunications services. The Competition Authority concluded that this alleged illegal practice took place between 2017 and 2018. MEO firmly denies the existence of any cartel. The maximum fine applicable for this kind of infraction corresponds to 10% of the turnover of each company in the specific markets that were impacted by the alleged illegal practices of both MEO and NOWO. In relation to MEO, such maximum fine amounts to approximately €52 million. On February 19, 2020, MEO has submitted its written defence to the Statement of Objections, after which the Portuguese Competition Authority will decide whether to issue a condemnatory decision and in that case the amount of the fine. The decision to impose a fine will end the administrative procedure with MEO having the possibility of challenging this decision in court.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,300,REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE,300.324,30.2.** **Israel,300.324.1,,"30.2.1. _Israel Consumer class action In June 2014, a claim and a motion to approve it as class action was filed at the Central District Court against HOTTelecommunication Systems Ltd. and HOT Telecom (together ""HOT""). The claim is based on the allegation that HOT ----- violated its licenses terms by failing to meet the required standards for response times in its call centers and by failing to operate the call centers during the entire working hours as required. In addition, the claimants argue that HOT did not comply with the Consumer Protection Regulations regarding the operation of a call back service in its call centers. The amount of the claim was estimated by the claimants at €10.3 million. On August 26, 2017, the Court certified the motion to approve the claim as class action based on the causes described above. Following the Court's decision, the parties submitted their statements of claim and defense and preliminary proceedings were conducted.

1769,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,300,REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE,300.325,Going concern,300.325.1,,"As of December 31, 2020, the Group had net current liability position of €560.8 million (mainly due to trade payables amounting to €1,371.6 million) and a positive working capital of €163.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group registered a net profit of €417.8 million from continuing operations and generated cash flows of €1,476.6 million from continuing operations. As at December 31, 2020, the Group had a equity position of €736.0 million compared to a negative equity position of €541.7 million as at December 31, 2019. The equity position increased from the prior period mainly due to comprehensive profit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the positive impact of transactions with non-controlling interests during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020. These positive impacts were partially offset by certain other transactions. As of December 31, 2020, the Group’s short-term borrowings comprised mainly loans from lenders for Altice Financing of €17.8 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Group’s short-term borrowings amounted to €276.6 million. The short-term obligations are expected to be covered by the operating cash flows of the operating subsidiaries. As at December 31, 2020, the amount drawn on the revolving credit facilities at Altice Financing amounted to nil. A listing of available credit facilities is provided in note 17.7 and the amounts available are sufficient to cover the short-term debt and interest expense needs of each of these segments if needed. The expected interest payments for the 12 months period ending December 31, 2021 amount to approximately €311.3 million. Given the above, the Board of Managers has considered the following elements in determining that the use of the going concern assumption is appropriate: - The Group’s performance on Adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flows: Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to €1,579.5 million, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA of €1,548.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 were €1,476.6 million. - The Group had unrestricted cash reserves of €354.0 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to €395.3 million as of December 31, 2019, which would allow it to cover any urgent cash needs. The Group can move its cash from one segment to another under certain conditions as allowed by the covenants under its various debentures and loan agreements. Cash reserves in operating segments carrying debt obligations were as follows: : €354.0 million. - Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, the Group had access to revolving credit facilities of up to €538.0 million, of which nil was drawn as at December 31, 2020. The Group’s senior executives track operational key operating measures (KPIs) on a weekly basis, thus tracking top line trends closely. This allows the Group’s senior executives and local CEOs to ensure proper alignment with budget targets and respond with speed and flexibility to counter any unexpected events and help to ensure that the budgeted targets are met. On April 17, 2020, the Group closed the transaction to sell 49.99% interest in the Portuguese fibre business to Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners. On April 17, 2020, the Group received €1,573.1 million of proceeds from this transaction. Regarding commitments, please refer to note 29 for more details. On March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic, highlighting the health risks of the disease. The COVID-19 pandemic had a limited impact on consolidated ----- financial statements of the Group as of December 31, 2020 and for the twelve month period then ended. Although the situation continues to evolve, the Company expects that the COVID19 pandemic will have limited effects on the Group’s operations and financial performance for future periods. Management expects the available cash on hand at December 31, 2020 and the expected limited impact of COVID19 on the Group’s cash flows to be sufficient to continue the Group’s operations and to repay all contractual obligations that fall due in the next 12 months. Accordingly, the Board of Managers is of the view that the Group will continue to act as a going concern for 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements and has hence deemed it appropriate to prepare these consolidated financial statements using the going concern assumption. As of December 31, 2019, the Group had net current liability position of €961.9 million (mainly due to trade payables amounting to €1,412.7 million) and a negative working capital of €258.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group registered a net profit of €438.9 million from continuing operations and generated cash flows of €1,363.6 million from continuing operations. As at December 31, 2019, the Group had a negative equity position of €542.1 million compared to an equity position of €25.0 million as at December 31, 2018. The equity position decreased from the prior period mainly due to the net loss and Other comprehensive loss recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019. The negative working capital position is structural and follows industry norms. Customers generally pay subscription revenues early or mid-month, with short days of sales outstanding and suppliers are paid under standard commercial terms, thus generating a negative working capital. This is evidenced by the difference in the level of receivables and payables: €1,023.6 million and €1,412.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to €943.6 million and €1,210.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Payables due the following month are covered by revenues and cash flows from operations (if needed). As of December 31, 2019, the Group’s short-term borrowings comprised mainly debentures in Altice Finco of €257.5 million and loans from lenders for Altice Financing of €19.1 million. As of December 31, 2018, the Group’s shortterm borrowings comprised mainly loans from lenders for Altice Financing for €18.8 million. The short-term obligations are expected to be covered by the operating cash flows of the operating subsidiaries. As at December 31, 2019, the amount drawn on the revolving credit facilities at Altice Financing amounted to nil. A listing of available credit facilities is provided in note 17.5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the amounts available per segments are sufficient to cover the short-term debt and interest expense needs of each of these segments if needed. ----- Given the above, the Board has considered the following elements in determining that the use of the going concern assumption is appropriate: - The Group’s performance on Adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flows: Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to €1,547.7 million, a decrease of 4.2% compared to the Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 were €1,363.6 million. - The Group had unrestricted cash reserves of €395.5 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to €597.3 million as of December 31, 2018, which would allow it to cover any urgent cash needs. The Group can move its cash from one segment to another under certain conditions as allowed by the covenants under its various debentures and loan agreements. Cash reserves in operating segments carrying debt obligations were as follows: Altice International: €395.5 million. - Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, the Group had access to revolving credit facilities of up to €581.0 million, of which nil was drawn as at December 31, 2019. The Group’s senior executives track operational key operating measures (KPIs) on a weekly basis, thus tracking top line trends closely. This allows the Group’s senior executives and local CEOs to ensure proper alignment with budget targets and respond with speed and flexibility to counter any unexpected events and help to ensure that the budgeted targets are met. Altice Group continues to review its fiber infrastructure to further accelerate its deployment and is exploring financial partnerships. On December 12, 2019, PT Portugal signed an agreement with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners to create a nationwide fibre wholesaler in Portugal. PT Portugal will sell to Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners a minority equity stake of 49.99% in Altice Portugal FTTH based on an enterprise value of €4.63 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, on January 2, 2020, PT Portugal sold its 25% equity interest in the tower company OMTEL to Cellnex Telecom S.A.. The total cash proceeds were received in the first quarter of 2020 and amounted to €201.0 million. Furthermore, through the successful refinancing of Altice International in the first quarter of 2020, significant annual interest savings through both average cost and debt reduction are expected. Based on the above, the Board is of the view that the Group will continue to act as a going concern for twelve months from the date of approval of the Consolidated Financial Statements and has hence deemed it appropriate to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements using the going concern assumption.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Managers is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Managers either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. ----- - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Managers. - Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Managers’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of the “Réviseur d’Entreprises Agréé” to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. . Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the “Réviseur d’Entreprises Agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the Board of Managers regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

The Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2019 and for the year then ended are presented in millions of Euros, except as otherwise stated, and have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted in the European Union (“IFRS”). The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain properties and financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company considers the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these Consolidated Financial Statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 16 _Leases, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value_ in IAS 2 Inventories or value in use in IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. For financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows: - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date; - Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability (please refer to note 19). Where the accounting treatment of a specific transaction is not addressed by any accounting standard and interpretation, the Board of Managers applies its judgment to define and apply accounting policies that provide information consistent with the general IFRS concepts: faithful representation and relevance. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Before the adoption of IFRS 16, the Group classified each of its leases (as lessee) at the inception date as either a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease was classified as a finance lease if it transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset to the Group; otherwise it was classified as an operating lease. ----- Finance leases were capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments were apportioned between interest (recognised as finance costs) and reduction of the lease liability. In an operating lease, the leased property was not capitalised and the lease payments were recognised as rent expense in the consolidated statement of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any prepaid rent and accrued rent were recognised under Trade and other receivables and Trade and other payables, respectively. Upon adoption of IFRS 16, the Group applied a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases that it is the lessee. The Group recognised lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. The standard provides specific transition requirements and practical expedients, which have been applied by the Group: - Right-of-use assets are reported separately in the statement of financial position. - The recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of IFRS 16 are also applied to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. - A distinction is made in leases that contain both lease components and non-lease components except for master service agreements with towers company. - Application of the portfolio approach for the recognition and measurements of certain asset categories with similar characteristics (same residual value, same economic environment), mainly for local loop unbundling. - Application of the standard to contracts that were previously identified as leases under IAS 17 / IFRIC 4 at the transition date. - Calculate outstanding liability for existing operating leases using the incremental borrowing rate at date of transition. - IFRS 16 is not applied to leases for intangible assets. - The Group chooses to apply the relief option, which allows it to adjust the right-of-use asset by the amount of any provision for onerous leases recognised in the balance sheet immediately before the date of initial application. Based on the aforementioned, as at January 1, 2019: - Right-of-use assets of €896.3 million were recognised and presented separately in the statement of financial position. This includes the lease assets recognised previously under finance leases of €18.8 million that were reclassified from Property, plant and equipment. - Additional lease liabilities of €930.1 million (current and non-current) were recognised (including the reclassification of finance lease liabilities already recorded as of December 31, 2018 of €54.0 million). - Trade and other receivables of €1.5 million related to previous operating leases were derecognised. In addition, the Group is closely monitoring the work of IASB and the IFRS Interpretation Committee, aiming to clarify interpretation of IFRS 16, which could lead to a revision of the accounting policies applied by the Group. The lease liabilities as at January 1, 2019 can be reconciled to the operating lease commitments as of December 31, 2018 as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The presentation of the segments here is consistent with the reporting used internally by the Board of Managers to track the Group’s operational and financial performance. The businesses that the Group owns and operates do not show significant seasonality, except for the mobile residential and business services, which can show significant changes in sales at year end and at the end of the summer season (the “back to school” period). The business ----- services are also impacted by the timing of preparation of the annual budgets of public and private sector companies. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies. The segments that are presented are detailed below: - **Portugal: Altice owns Portugal Telecom (“PT Portugal”), the largest telecom operator in Portugal. PT Portugal caters to fixed residential, mobile residential and business services clients using the MEO brand. As of 2018, this segment also includes the Altice Technical Services entities in Portugal. - **Israel: Fixed and mobile services are provided using the HOT telecom, HOT mobile and HOT net brands to residential and business services clients.

For more details on the GCGUs, please refer to notes 2.9 and 5. Goodwill is tested at the level of each GCGU or CGU annually for impairment and whenever changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill was tested at the CGU/GCGU level for impairment as of December 31, 2019. The CGU/GCGU is at the country level where the subsidiaries operate. The recoverable amounts of the GCGUs are determined based on their value in use. The Group determined value in use for purposes of its impairment testing and, accordingly, did not determine the fair value less cost of disposal of the GCGUs. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are primarily the post-tax discount rates, the terminal growth rate, revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures. Following the application of IFRS 16 Leases, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, other expenses and incomes (capital gains, nonrecurring litigation, restructuring costs) and share-based expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IAS 17 Leases for operating lease). The Board of Managers and the Group’s senior executives have determined that there have not been any changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. In addition, there were no significant changes in assets or liabilities in any CGU/GCGU, while the recoverable amounts continue to significantly exceed the carrying amounts. Therefore, no updated impairment testing was performed, nor any impairment recorded, for the year ended December 31, 2019. 5.1.1. _Key assumptions used in impairment testing The Group has made use of various external indicators and internal reporting tools to estimate the revenue growth rates used in the Group’s impairment testing for the year ended December 31, 2019. ----- 5.1.1.1. _Cash flows The value in use of each GCGU was determined by estimating cash flows for a period of five years for the operating activities. Cash flow forecasts are derived from the most recent business plans approved by the Board of Managers. Beyond the specifically forecasted period of five years, the Company extrapolates cash flows for the remaining years based on an estimated constant growth rate between 0.5% - 4.3%. The growth rate is estimated at an individual subsidiary level and does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. 5.1.1.2. _Discount rates Discount rates have been estimated using post-tax rates, which reflect current market rates for investments of similar risk. The discount rate for the GCGUs was estimated using the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) of companies that operate a portfolio of assets similar to the Group’s. The WACC used across the Group for the calculation of the value in use at December 31, 2019 ranges from 6.0% to 11.5%. 5.1.1.3. _Other internal assumptions The Groups makes assumptions of customer churn rates and operating income, or Adjusted EBITDA (and the Adjusted EBITDA margin). These assumptions were based on historical experience and expectations of future changes in the market. The Group also assumes that recurring capex is expected to be proportional to sales, related to the acquisition of new clients, and thus is indexed to the growth in revenues. 5.1.1.4. _Assumptions about external factors In addition to using internal indicators to assess the carrying amount in use, the Board of Managers also relies on external factors which can influence the cash generating capacity of the CGUs or GCGUs and indicate that certain factors beyond the control of the Board of Managers might influence the carrying amounts in use: - Indicators of market slowdown in a country of operation, - Indicators of degradation in financial markets, that can impact the financing ability of the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The majority of intangible assets are related to the recognition of intangible assets on acquisition of business combinations as a reduction in the value of attributable goodwill. The key items include: - Customer relations: these assets are valued using the excess earnings method upon acquisition and subsequently amortized based on the local churn rate. The carrying amount of customer relations by segment was: (i) Portugal: €533.4 million, (ii) Israel: €72.3 million, (iii) the Dominican Republic: €1.1 million. - Brand name: the carrying amounts of the Group’s main brand names includes: (i) MEO in Portugal: €39.6 million, (ii) HOT in Israel: €6.3 million, (iii) Teads: €13.3 million. Content rights: corresponds mainly to content right in Israel as HOT co-develops and co-owns high-quality original local content together with local producers and broadcasts it on HOT proprietary channels. The content rights were capitalized in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets and are amortized over their respective useful lives. When useful lives extend beyond one year the nominal cash flows are discounted to their present value on initial recognition of the asset. The amortization related to content rights recorded for local production and fiction in Israel for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €43.9 million (average useful life is 3 years).",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The amount of finance lease existing under IAS 17 _Leases as at December 31, 2018 have been reclassified under the caption lease liabilities in the statement of financial_ position and amounts to €39.1 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to €54.0 million as at December 31, 2018. The amounts of non-current and current finance lease existing under IAS 17 Leases (before the adoption of IFRS 16 _Leases) as at December 31, 2019 were €23.5 million and €15.6 million, respectively. Please also refer to note 1.3.3_ for more details on IFRS 16 Leases. 17.6.2. _Reverse factoring Through the use of reverse factoring structures, the Group extends its payment terms up to 360 days, reducing its requirements for working capital. The contractual arrangements in place permit the supplier to obtain the amounts invoiced at agreed payment term with the amounts paid by the banks that participate in the reverse factoring structure. The Group will repay the banks the full invoice amount, with interest, on the scheduled payment date as required by the reverse factoring agreement. Based on the scheduled payment dates, the amounts payable under this arrangement are accounted for as current liabilities. As the amounts are payable to the participating banks, the amounts have been presented under Other financial liabilities. In the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the cash flows related to reverse factoring are presented under Changes in working capital for the movement in Trade payable and Other cash provided by financing activities relating to the net payment to the banks. The increase in reverse factoring as at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 is due to the combination of timing of reverse factoring capacity with the banks. 17.6.3. _Accrued interest Accrued interest is the amount of interest due at balance sheet date regarding the Company’s outstanding debentures and loans from financial institutions. 17.6.4. _Put options with non-controlling interests The Group executes agreements with the non-controlling interests in certain acquisitions whereby the non-controlling interests have the option to sell their non-controlling interests to the Group. These instruments are measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date (please refer to note 19.1.2 for further information). 17.6.5. _Mandatory Convertible Notes The Mandatory Convertible Notes (“MCN”) were issued for an aggregate amount of €2,055 million, which were ----- entirely subscribed by the Company’s sole Partner, Altice Luxembourg S.A. These instruments are compound financial instruments that contain both a liability and an equity component. The non-current portion of the MCN liability recorded at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are €489.9 million and €586.9 million respectively. The current portion of the MCN liability recorded at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are €139.9 million and €139.5 million respectively. 17.6.6. _Debt and liabilities with Altice Group companies Debts and liabilities with Altice Group companies relate to debts and liabilities which Altice International has with Altice Europe group companies outside of the Altice International Group. 17.6.7. _Other Other consists mainly of various other debts and liabilities of the Altice Group.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

These valuations are directly observable in an open market and therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 19.1.2.2.Derivative financial instruments Future cash flows are estimated using market observable data at the end of the reporting period (namely, forward exchange rates and interest rates) and the contracted rates of the derivative discounted at a rate that reflects the counterparty credit risk. Since model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management ----- judgement, the Company has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 19.1.2.3.Put options Each contract has specific terms and conditions, and the valuation is performed using the contracted terms and assessment against market comparable information where appropriate. For example, the exercise price in the option may be determined based on an EBITDA multiple minus the net financial debt. In all instances, the probabilities of the option being exercised is determined using management’s best estimate and judgement. The resulting fair value is discounted using appropriate discount rates of the related funding pool (4.5%). These models use a variety of inputs that use judgements not able to be verified externally, therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 19.1.2.4.Call options The valuation is derived by calculating the intrinsic value, being the difference in the value of the underlying asset and the options exercise price, and time value of the option, which accounts for the passage of time until the option expires. Various inputs are used, including the price of the underlying asset and its volatility (47%), the strike price and maturity in the contract, and the risk-free rate (ranging between -0.632% and -0.624%) and dividend yield (0%). The model calculates the possible prices of the underlying asset and their respective probability of occurrence, given these inputs.

The decrease in the amount of Net operating losses and tax carry forward net of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019 is mainly due to PT Portugal. The Group does not believe that the unrecognised deferred tax losses can be used given the Group’s current structure, but the Group will continue exploring opportunities to offset these against any future profits that the Company or its subsidiaries may generate. Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Group's future deductible temporary differences and NOLs. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is probable that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management takes into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Group may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income tax expense in the consolidated income statement. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, the Group recognised deferred tax asset on the basis of projections of future use of the loss carry forward deemed probable.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The provision covers risks related mainly to the potential return of tax credits/incentives and VAT on indemnities charged as result of the breach of loyalty contracts entered with post-paid customers. The VAT contingency relates to both the fixed and mobile businesses and covers years since 2012. The claim for the VAT of the mobile company in 2012 was being discussed in an arbitral court, which decided to send the matter to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), that issued a decision on November 22, 2018 which was not favourable to MEO, concluding that, under certain circumstances, indemnities should be charged with VAT, and at the same time referring that ultimately VAT should only be assessed based on indemnities received from customers. The tax assessments of the fixed-line company in 2012 and both the mobile and fixed-line companies in 2013 and 2014, were submitted to the arbitral court as well, and all were suspended and waited for the decision of the ECJ. Following the ECJ decision, MEO was notified of the arbitral court decisions on the 2013 fixed and 2012 mobile actions, both unfavourable but both referring that VAT should only be assessed based on indemnities received from customers, which is less than 20% of the overall indemnities invoiced. MEO will be appealing from both these decisions to the Administrative Central Court. For the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 MEO reached an agreement with the tax authorities resulting in the payment of approximately €3 million. For following years, it is not certain that the tax authorities accept similar agreements. 23.4.2. _Israel On July 4, 2019, HOT signed a compromise agreement with the Israeli tax authorities for an amount of €7.6 million related to tax assessment for periods 2015-2016. 23.4.3. _Other tax jurisdictions Tax assessments are conducted in other tax jurisdictions within the Group (Israel and Luxembourg).

In this context and following regulatory requirements published by governments over the last weeks in the countries in which the Group operates, the Group continues to assess conditions in order to adapt to the business and social environment in which it operates. The COVID-19 pandemic can have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations, depending on the nature and period of governmental measures in the countries in which the Group operates. Impact may include: (i) the slowdown of the production capabilities of China or other affected countries may have a negative impact on hardware, software and other providers of outsourced services that the Group relies on to provide its services, and the global reach of the pandemic may lead to a situation where there are no clear or cost effective alternatives; (ii) delay in infrastructural projects; (iii) productivity of the workforce may decline due to an increase in sick leaves, quarantine procedures and work or travel restrictions; and (iv) habits and financial situation of customers may change due to the economic slowdown and possibility of a worldwide recession, e.g., postponing purchase decisions, breaking contracts and personal or corporate bankruptcies. The Group has activated a response program in order to minimize the impact of this risk, by protecting employees, securing the supply chain, and continuously monitoring the situation and leveraging at the same time the Group’s services that may help in the virus containment efforts, such as videoconferencing and online classes. In addition, networks play a key role in keeping people connected and the Group is monitoring its network usage and assessing its policies and procedures to best support its customers. As of the date of issuance of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group is facing a decline in handsets sales (low margin activity) in the context of the closure of the shops in many countries where the Group operates and a decline in the advertising businesses (Teads) but the impact has been limited, since the crisis only began at the beginning of March 2020. ----- The situation continues to evolve, including further regulatory requirements published by governments, and it is difficult to predict the effect on the Group’s operations and financial performance. Based on the above and information in note 31, the Group considers that the assessment of the going concern assumption for the Group is not impacted",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
