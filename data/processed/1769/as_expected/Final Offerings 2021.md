The attached Offering Memorandum is being distributed only to and directed only at (i) persons who are outside
the U.K., (ii) persons who have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article
19(5) of The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 or (iii) those persons to
whom it may otherwise lawfully be distributed (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”).
This Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons
who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates
is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

The information in the attached Offering Memorandum is not complete and may be changed. The materials
relating to the offering of the Notes do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or
solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the
offering of the Notes be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the initial purchasers or any affiliate of the initial
purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering of the Notes shall be deemed to be made
by the initial purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer in such jurisdiction.

**PRIIPS REGULATION/PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS: The Notes are not**
intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to any “retail investor” in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID
**II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution**
**Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1)**
of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**U.K. PRIIPS REGULATION/PROHIBITION OF SALES TO U.K. RETAIL INVESTORS: The Notes are**
not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to any “retail investor” in the U.K. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms part
of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within
the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, “FSMA”) and any
rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No. 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared,
and therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the U.K.
may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls any Initial Purchaser, the Issuer or any of its respective

Memorandum distributed to you in electronic format and the hard copy version available to you on request from
the Initial Purchasers.

You are reminded that the attached Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a
person into whose possession the attached Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with
the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver this

**Restrictions: Any securities to be issued will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws**
of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit
of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the expiration of a 40-day
distribution compliance period (as defined under Regulation S) commencing on the Issue Date (as defined in the

attached Offering Memorandum), the securities may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the
account or benefit of, U.S. persons, except pursuant to another exemption from the registration requirements of
the U.S. Securities Act.

**MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the purposes**
of the product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes described (and as defined)
in the attached Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of
such Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The target market and distribution
channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in force in the relevant
jurisdiction. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such Notes (a “distributor”) should take
into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or
refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**UK MIFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the**
purposes of the product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes, taking into account
the five categories referred to in item 18 of the Guidelines published by the European Securities and Markets
Authority (“ESMA”) on February 5, 2018 (in accordance with the FCA’s policy statement entitled “Brexit our
**approach to EU non-legislative materials”), has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is**
only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor
subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR
**Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the**
Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

The Issuer is offering the Notes in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities
Act. The Notes have not been registered with, recommended by or approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) or any other securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC or any such
securities commission or authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this Offering Memorandum. Any
representation to the contrary is a criminal offense in the United States.

This Offering Memorandum is a confidential document that is being provided for informational use solely in
connection with consideration of a purchase of the Notes (i) to U.S. investors that the Issuer reasonably believes
to be qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A and (ii) to certain persons in offshore transactions
complying with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S. Its use for any other purpose is not authorized. This
Offering Memorandum may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part nor may it be distributed or any of
its contents be disclosed to anyone other than the qualified institutional buyers described in (i) above or to persons
considering a purchase of the Notes in offshore transactions described in (ii) above and, in each case, any advisors
to such persons in connection with this offering.

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) are investment professionals, as such term
is defined in Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as

not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to

which this Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with
relevant persons.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis of an exemption provided by the Preamble 14 (and
Article 4) of the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “EU **Prospectus Regulation”) and on the basis of**
an exemption provided by Preamble 14 (and Article 4) of the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”), in
each case stating that the mere admission of securities to trading on the multilateral trading facility (as defined in
point (22) of article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU), is not to be regarded in itself as an offer of securities to the
public and is therefore not subject to the obligation to draw up, approve and distribute the prospectus as required
by the EU Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation, as applicable. Accordingly, any person making
or intending to make any offer within the EEA or the U.K. of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in
which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer.
Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do any of them authorize, the making of any
offer of the Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers which
constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum.

The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as
permitted under the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable securities laws. See “Notice to Investors”. You
should be aware that you may be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of
time.

Application will be made to the Authority to list the Notes on the Exchange, and we intend to submit this Offering
Memorandum to the competent authority in connection with the listing application. In the course of any review
by the Authority, we may be requested to make changes to the financial and other information included in this
Offering Memorandum in producing listing particulars for such listing. Comments by the Authority may require
significant modification or reformulation of information contained in this Offering Memorandum or may require
inclusion of additional information. We may also be required to update the information in this Offering
Memorandum to reflect changes in the business, financial condition or results of operations and prospects of the
Issuer, the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries. There is no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the
Exchange, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing.

Neither the admission of the Notes to trading on the Exchange nor the approval of this Offering Memorandum
pursuant to the listing requirements of the Authority shall constitute a warranty or representation by the Authority
as to the competence of the service providers to, or any other party connected with, the Issuer, the adequacy and
accuracy of information contained in this Offering Memorandum or the suitability of the Issuer for investment or
for any other purpose.

You are not to construe the contents of this Offering Memorandum as investment, legal or tax advice. You should
consult your own counsel, accountant and other advisers as to legal, tax, business, financial and related aspects of
a purchase of the Notes. You are responsible for making your own examination of the Issuer and the Group and
your own assessment of the merits and risks of investing in the Notes. The Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the
Trustee and their respective agents are not making any representation to you regarding the legality of an
investment in the Notes by you.

The information contained in this Offering Memorandum has been furnished by the Issuer and Altice International

Initial Purchasers, the Trustee and their respective agents as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the

unlawful to make such an offer or invitation. You must comply with all laws that apply to you in any place in

**NOTICE TO U.S. INVESTORS**

Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and acknowledgements
that are described in this Offering Memorandum under “Notice to Investors”. The Notes and the Guarantees have
not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the United


-----

States and are subject to certain restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold
except as permitted under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, pursuant to registration
or an exemption therefrom. Prospective purchasers are hereby notified that the seller of any Note may be relying
on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. For a
description of certain further restrictions on resale or transfer of the Notes, see “Notice to Investors”. The Notes
may not be offered to the retail investors within any jurisdiction. By accepting delivery of this Offering
Memorandum, you agree not to offer, sell, resell transfer or deliver, directly or indirectly, any Note to the retail
investors.

**PRIIPS REGULATION/PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any “retail investor” in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the
“Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined
in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**U.K. PRIIPS REGULATION/PROHIBITION OF SALES TO U.K. RETAIL INVESTORS**

The securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any “retail investor” in the U.K. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No.
2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”);
or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as
amended, “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation
(EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA
(the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the U.K. has been prepared, and therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the U.K. may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**MIFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE/PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPS ONLY TARGET**
**MARKET**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each of BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE
and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (each, an “EU **manufacturer”), the target market assessment in respect**
of the Notes described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such
Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for
distribution of such Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The target market
and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in
force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such Notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the EU manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such
Notes (by either adopting or refining the EU manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

**U.K. MIFIR PRODUCT GOVERNANCE / PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPS ONLY**
**TARGET MARKET**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (the “UK
**manufacturer”), the target market assessment in respect of the Notes, taking into account the five categories**
referred to in item 18 of the Guidelines published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”)
on February 5, 2018 (in accordance with the FCA’s policy statement entitled “Brexit our approach to EU non**legislative materials”), has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible**
counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional


-----

clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK
**MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are**
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take
into consideration the UK manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA
Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance
**Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting**
or refining the UK manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

_Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “IFRS” herein are to International_
_Financial Reporting Standards as adopted in the EU._

**Financial Statements Presented**

The Issuer is incorporated under the name of Altice Financing S.A. as a public limited liability company (société
_anonyme), incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg on August 17, 2012. The Issuer is a wholly-_
owned subsidiary of Altice International. This Offering Memorandum includes the following historical
consolidated financial information of Altice International:

- the audited consolidated financial statements for Altice International as of and for the year ended December
31, 2020 (which include comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019) prepared in
accordance with IFRS as adopted in the EU and which have been audited by KPMG Luxembourg, Société
cooperative (the “2020 Financial Statements”);

- the audited consolidated financial statements for Altice International as of and for the year ended December
31, 2019 (which include comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018) prepared in
accordance with IFRS as adopted in the EU and which have been audited by Deloitte Audit S.à r.l. (the “2019
**Financial Statements” and together with the 2020 Financial Statements, the “Audited Financial**
**Statements”); and**

- the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for Altice International as of and for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 (which include comparative figures for the three months ended March
31, 2020) prepared in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted in the EU and which have been reviewed by KPMG
Luxembourg, Société cooperative (the “Unaudited Financial Statements”).

The historical consolidated financial information of Altice International described above, including the
accompanying notes thereto, are referred to herein as the “Historical Consolidated Financial Information”.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted in the EU requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying
Altice International’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to Altice International’s financial statements are disclosed
in the Historical Consolidated Financial Information.

The Group has adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) (“IFRS 16”) using the modified retrospective method of adoption with
the date of initial application of January 1, 2019. The comparative financial information as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2018 in the 2019 Financial Statements has not been restated for the impacts of IFRS 16.

The Historical Consolidated Financial Information mentioned above does not indicate results that may be expected
for any future period.

**_Significant Events Affecting Comparability of the Historical Consolidated Financial Information_**

Altice International is a holding company which, since its formation in 2008, has from time to time made
significant investments and disposals in a number of cable, media and telecommunication businesses in various
jurisdictions. As a result of such acquisitions and disposals that have been consummated by the Group during the
periods presented in this Offering Memorandum, and the intra-year timing of such acquisitions and disposals, the
comparability of the Historical Consolidated Financial Information over each of such periods may be limited. For
more information on the key investments and disposals made by Altice International since 2018 which have had
a significant impact on the Historical Consolidated Financial Information, please see “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Discussion and Analysis of Our Results of_
_Operations—For the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020—_

_December 31, 2018—Significant Events Affecting Historical Results” and “Description of our Business—_
_Significant Investments and Dispositions” for more information. Unless otherwise specified, the Historical_
Consolidated Financial Information does not give pro forma effect to the acquisitions and disposals that have been
consummated by the Group during the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum, or to any acquisitions
and disposals occurring after March 31, 2021.

**_LTM Financial Information_**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended March
31, 2021. This financial information has been calculated by adding Altice International’s historical financial
information for the three months ended March 31, 2021 (derived from the Unaudited Financial Statements), to
Altice International’s historical financial information for the year ended December 31, 2020 (derived from the
2020 Financial Statements), and subtracting Altice International’s historical financial information for the three
months ended March 31, 2020 (derived from the Unaudited Financial Statements) (the “LTM Financial
**Information”). Unless otherwise specified, no pro forma adjustments have been applied to the LTM Financial**
Information. The LTM Financial Information has been prepared solely for the purposes of this Offering
Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting and has not been audited or
reviewed. It is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of Altice International’s results
of operations, for any future period or Altice International’s financial condition at any future date.

**Non-IFRS Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains measures and ratios (the “Non-IFRS Measures”), including Adjusted
EBITDA, Operating Free Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures (Accrued), Total Net Debt and Senior Net Debt, that
are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards.
We present Non-IFRS Measures herein because we believe that they are of interest to the investors and similar
measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental
measures of performance and liquidity. We believe these measures are useful as they provide a measure of
operating results excluding certain items that the Group’s management believe are either outside of its recurring
operating activities, or items that are non-cash. Excluding such items enables trends in the Group’s operating
results and cash flow generation to be more easily observable. The Non-IFRS Measures are used by the Group
internally to manage and assess the results of its operations, make decisions with respect to investments and
allocation of resources, and assess the performance of management personnel. Such performance measures are
also the de facto metrics used by investors and other members of the financial community to value other companies
operating in the same industry as the Group and thus are a basis for comparability between the Group and its peers.

The Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations
as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our, or any of our
subsidiaries’, operating results as reported under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting standards. The NonIFRS Measures may also be defined differently than the corresponding terms governing our indebtedness,
including the Altice Financing Indentures (as defined herein) and the Indenture. Non-IFRS Measures, such as
Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Free Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures (Accrued), Total Net Debt and Senior Net
Debt are not measurements of our, or any of our subsidiaries’, performance or liquidity under IFRS or any other
generally accepted accounting principles. In particular, you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA, Operating
Free Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures (Accrued), Total Net Debt and Senior Net Debt in isolation or as an
alternative to (a) operating profit or profit for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure
of our, or any of our operating entities’, operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and
financing activities as a measure of our, or any of our subsidiaries’, ability to meet our cash needs or (c) any other
measures of performance under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting standards. Adjusted EBITDA,
Operating Free Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures (Accrued), Total Net Debt and Senior Net Debt have certain
limitations as analytical tools, including but not limited to:

- they do not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments;


-----

- although depreciation, amortization and impairment are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will generally need to be replaced in the future;

- Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Free Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures (Accrued) do not reflect any cash
requirements that would be required for such replacements; and

- some of the other expenses and income items that we or our operating entities eliminate in calculating
Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Free Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures (Accrued) reflect cash payments that
were made, or will in the future be made.

Our primary Non-IFRS Measures include:

- “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as, (i) for periods prior to the application of IFRS 16, operating profit before
depreciation, amortization and impairment, other expenses and income (capital gains, non-recurring litigation,
restructuring costs) and share-based expenses and (ii) following the application of IFRS 16, as operating profit
before depreciation, amortization and impairment, other expenses and income (capital gains, non-recurring
litigation, restructuring costs), share-based expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line
recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IAS 17 Leases for operating leases)
allowing comparability for each of the periods presented. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Adjusted EBITDA” for more information. For a_
reconciliation of the Group’s profit/(loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA, see “Summary
_Financial Information and Other Financial Data—Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA—Reconciliation of_
_profit/(loss) from continuing operations and operating profit/(loss) to Adjusted EBITDA”._

- “Operating Free Cash Flow” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures (Accrued). See
“Summary Financial Information and Other Financial Data—Capital Expenditures (Accrued) and Operating
_Free Cash Flow” for more information. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for_
operating cash flow as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with IAS 7
(Statement of Cash Flows).

- “Capital Expenditures (Accrued)” is defined as additions in tangible and intangible assets and contracts
costs and include the following by activities:

     - the fixed business has fixed capital expenditure requirements that are mainly discretionary (network,
platforms, general) and variable capital expenditure requirements related to the connection of new
customers and the purchase of customer premises equipment (TV decoder, modem, etc.);

     - mobile capital expenditures are mainly driven by investment in new mobile sites, upgrade to new
mobile technology and licenses to operate; once engaged and operational, there are limited further
capital expenditure requirements; and

     - other capital expenditures are mainly related to costs incurred in acquiring content rights.

We use the below mentioned terms and definitions, which are relevant when calculating the Non-IFRS Measures
discussed above:

- “Capital Expenditures (Working Capital Items)” is defined as change in fixed asset payables included in
‘Current Liabilities’ caption of the consolidated statement of financial position.

- “Total Capital Expenditures” is equal to “payment to acquire tangible and intangible assets and contract
costs” in our statement of cash flows, and can also be presented as the sum total of Capital Expenditures
(Accrued) and Capital Expenditures (Working Capital Items). For a reconciliation of Capital Expenditures
(Accrued) to payment to acquire tangible and intangible assets and contract costs, as presented in ‘net cash
used in investing activities’ in the consolidated cash flow statement, see “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Total Capital Expenditures”._

- “Working Capital” is defined as the sum of inventories and trade and other receivables less trade and other
payables. This computation may not be comparable to that of similarly titled measures presented by other
companies. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—

**_Certain As Adjusted Financial Information_**

This Offering Memorandum also includes certain financial information, including Total Net Debt and Senior Net
Debt, on an as adjusted basis to give effect to (a) the Refinancing Transactions, including the offering of the Notes
hereby and the application of the proceeds therefrom and (b) receipt of the cash proceeds expected to be received
in 2021 from the Altice Portugal FTTH Transaction, as if such transactions had occurred on March 31, 2021.
“Total Net Debt” is defined as total third-party financial debt (excluding other long term and short term liabilities,
other than finance leases prior to giving effect to IFRS 16) after taking into account the currency impact of
derivative instruments with respect to our existing debt as presented under the line ‘Total third-party financial
debt (after currency impact of derivative instruments)’ in “Capitalization” less cash and cash equivalents. “Senior
**Net Debt” is defined as total third-party senior secured debt under the Altice Financing Notes, the Altice**
Financing Revolving Credit Facilities, the Altice Financing Term Loans and the finance leases prior to giving
effect to IFRS 16 after taking into account the currency impact of derivative instruments with respect to our
existing debt as presented under the line ‘Total third-party senior secured debt (after currency impact of derivative
instruments)’ in “Capitalization” _less cash and cash equivalents. The as adjusted financial information under_
“Summary Financial and Other Information—Certain As Adjusted Information” has been prepared for illustrative
purposes only and does not represent what the Group’s Total Net Debt or Senior Net Debt would have been had
the Refinancing Transactions and the Altice Portugal FTTH Transaction occurred on such dates, nor does it
purport to project the Group’s indebtedness or cash interest expense at any future date. This as adjusted financial
information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S.
Securities Act, the EU Prospectus Regulation, IFRS or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the
assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted financial information have been audited or
reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing or review standards. Management believes that Total
Net Debt and Senior Net Debt are useful indicators of the Group’s indebtedness, financial flexibility and capital
structure because they indicate the level of borrowings after taking account of cash and cash equivalents within
the Group’s business that could be utilized to pay down the outstanding borrowings and since certain financial
covenants and incurrence covenants under the Group’s existing indebtedness are calculated on a net basis after
taking into account the cash and cash equivalents.

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this offering and the
financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your own professional
advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and how those differences could
affect the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

Certain monetary amounts, percentages and other figures included in this Offering Memorandum have been
rounded. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables and charts may not be the arithmetic aggregation
of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total 100%.

**Market and Industry Data**

We operate in industries in which it is difficult to obtain precise market and industry information. We have
generally obtained the market and competitive position data in this Offering Memorandum from our competitors’
public filings, from industry publications and from surveys or studies conducted by third party sources that we
believe to be reliable. Certain information in this Offering Memorandum contains market research derived from
third party sources and reports and should not be relied upon in making, or refraining from making, any investment
decision. Forecasts and other forward-looking information obtained from these sources are subject to the same
qualifications and uncertainties as the other forward-looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in
this Offering Memorandum.

In our footprint in the jurisdictions in which we operate, market shares are calculated from our penetration data
by extrapolating overall market penetration from industry sources to our footprint. We are also required to
calculate market share for certain of our services under the relevant operating licenses and the calculation of
market share for such purposes may be based on different parameters compared to the market share presented in
this Offering Memorandum.

However, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers or any of our or their respective advisors can verify the accuracy
and completeness of such information and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers or any of our or their respective
advisors has independently verified such market and position data. We do, however, accept responsibility for the
correct reproduction of this information and, as far as we are aware and are able to ascertain from information
published, no facts have been omitted that would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading.

In addition, in many cases we have made statements in this Offering Memorandum regarding our industries and
our position in these industries based on our experience and our own investigation of market conditions. Neither
we nor the Initial Purchasers or any of our or their respective advisors can assure you that any of these assumptions
are accurate or correctly reflect our position in these industries, and none of our or their internal surveys or
information has been verified by independent sources.

The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic has created significant uncertainty in the global economic environment
and the industry in which we operate. Certain reports and publications from which we have obtained industry and
market data that are used in this Offering Memorandum may not reflect the current or ultimate impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on our industry.

**Overview**

We are a multinational broadband and mobile communications, content and media group operating in Portugal,
Israel and the Dominican Republic. We have major positions in a number of segments of the telecommunications
markets in which we operate, including residential fixed, residential mobile and business services, which includes
B2B services and wholesale, and also offer other services, which includes media, content and advertisement
services. In the geographies in which we operate, we are either the largest or the second largest fixed services
provider, and a leading provider of multi-play services offering bundled triple-play (“3P”) services and, where
possible, quad-play (“4P”) services and focus our marketing on our multi-play offerings. We are also the largest
mobile operator in Portugal, the second largest mobile operator in the Dominican Republic, and a significant
competitor to the three largest mobile operators in Israel. As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately 10,159,000
total mobile B2C subscribers and approximately 3,011,000 total fixed B2C unique customers as well as a fiber
network passing approximately 8,707,000 homes in our footprint (including homes accessed through wholesale
fiber operators). Our service portfolio in each of the regions in which we operate is set forth below under “—
_Overview of Service Portfolio”._

The Group was created through a number of price-disciplined acquisitions of telecommunications businesses,
including: PT Portugal in Portugal, HOT in Israel, and Altice Dominicana in the Dominican Republic. Our
acquisition strategy has allowed us to target fiber/cable and mobile operators with what we believe to be highquality networks in markets we find attractive from an economic, competitive and regulatory standpoint and create
value at the acquired businesses by implementing operational improvements and leveraging economies of scale,
as well as pursuing in-market consolidation and attractive diversification with B2B, DSL and mobile add-on
opportunities. Furthermore, this has enabled us to grow the acquired businesses organically while we continue to
focus on cost optimization and increasing economies of scale and operational synergies as our Group develops.
Moreover, as part of our strategy, we also focus on the convergence of telecommunications, media, content and
advertising to offer more value to our customers. For example, since June 2017 we have owned Teads, which is a
leading video advertising marketplace with, as of April 2021, 1.9 billion unique monthly users worldwide. In
Portugal, in February 2017, we acquired a 25% stake in the capital of sports broadcaster SPORT TV.

We have invested in high quality cable and fiber-based network infrastructure which allows us to offer advanced
multi-play and high bandwidth services in a vast majority of our service areas. Our fixed-line services in Portugal
are primarily delivered over FTTH, DSL and DTH, in Israel are primarily delivered over HFC cables (and since
April 2021, fiber-based internet services are also delivered over IBC Israel’s fiber optic network in certain areas
where the network had already been deployed) and in the Dominican Republic are delivered over both HFC cable
and FTTH, in each case that are among the most technically advanced in the markets in which we operate. Our
cable networks enable us to offer download speeds of at least 200 Mbps to a majority of homes passed in our
footprint in Israel and the Dominican Republic. We believe that our cable networks are well positioned for future
technological developments, while the fiber networks in Portugal are already set up to provide download speeds
of up to 1 Gbps. We are focused on increasing our investment in fiber in Portugal. We own 50.01% of FastFiber

- Infraestruturas de Comunicaçã, S.A. (“FastFiber”) (formerly known as Altice Portugal FTTH), comprising all
of our fiber assets in Portugal, including FTTH and dark fiber, which was created in April 2020 in partnership
with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners. Through FastFiber, we rolled out over 388,000 new fiber homes
passed in 2018, 356,000 new fiber homes passed in 2019, 603,000 new fiber homes passed in 2020 and a further
73,000 new fiber homes passed in the three months ended March 31, 2021. Throughout our geographies, we are
working to expand our fiber network. In Israel, in February 2021, we acquired a 23.3% stake in IBC Israel
Broadband Company (2013) Ltd. (“IBC Israel”). In Portugal and the Dominican Republic, we continue to upsell
our fiber/cable based services to our existing DSL subscriber base. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021,


-----

without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, we generated residential fixed revenues of €631 million in
Portugal, €563 million in Israel and €91 million in the Dominican Republic.

We operate an extensive mobile network, which provides 4G coverage for 99.6% of the population of Portugal,
99.9% of the population of Israel and 97.5% of the population of the Dominican Republic, in each case, as of
March 31, 2021. In addition, we have relationships with the industry’s significant mobile equipment providers
and are able to offer customers top-of-the-market mobile equipment. In 2018, we completed the Towers
Transactions, through which we monetized the value of our passive mobile infrastructure assets in Portugal and
the Dominican Republic. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, without giving effect to intersegment
eliminations, we generated residential mobile revenues of €463 million in Portugal, €210 million in Israel and
€263 million in the Dominican Republic.

Further, we are in various stages of bidding for and investing in 5G spectrum in all jurisdictions in which we
operate our mobile services. Following the completion of the 5G spectrum auction in Israel in August 2020, HOT
along with Partner Communications Company Ltd. (“Partner”) was awarded two bands of 700 MHz (10 MHz
each band), two bands of 2,600 MHz (20 MHz each band) and 10 bands of 3,500 MHz (10 MHz each band). After
completion of the required preconditions, on September 29, 2020 the spectrums were allocated to HOT and HOT’s
license was amended to allow the operation of 5G network. We launched 5G services in the first quarter of 2021
in certain areas in Israel. In Portugal, the 5G spectrum auction started on December 22, 2020 and the main auction
is ongoing. The expected allocation of rights of use for frequencies is scheduled for the third quarter of 2021. In
the Dominican Republic, the 5G spectrum auction started on February 9, 2021 and the auction is ongoing. The
expected allocation of rights of use for frequencies is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect to
participate in both of these auctions.

In furtherance of our convergence strategy, we are focused on delivering high quality content offerings to
complement our fixed and mobile services, including producing proprietary content, including live broadcasts of
sports events and other sports- and lifestyle-related programs as well as the sports programming for which the
Group has acquired broadcasting rights. For instance, this strategy is evidenced by our investment in SPORT TV
for broadcasting premium sports content in Portugal. In July 2020, PT OpCo entered into a new distribution
agreement with SPORT TV for a four-season period, pursuant to which PT Portugal committed to pay a noncontingent fixed price plus an additional variable fee component based on the number of subscribers and
penetration rate. Between the end of 2015 and early 2016, we also entered into various agreements with other
telecom operators and football clubs in Portugal to acquire reciprocal or exclusive broadcasting rights, including
a sponsorship agreement with F.C. Porto. In Israel, we have entered into commitments to purchase content, mainly
channels. We have also entered into various arrangements with Altice France Group’s Altice TV division,
including non-exclusive distribution rights in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic of Netflix and
Discovery channels. We intend to continue to selectively invest in local and value-added premium content as well
as sports broadcasting and distribution rights in the future to differentiate our convergent communication services
from those of our competitors.

Through Teads, the digital advertising business acquired in 2017, we operate a leading, cloud-based, end-to-end
technology platform that enables programmatic digital advertising for a global, curated ecosystem of quality
advertisers and their agencies and quality publishers. Teads operates in the internet ecosystem (the “Open Web”)
outside of advertising platforms, like Facebook and Google, which are known as the walled gardens (the “Walled
**Gardens”). As an end-to-end solution, Teads’ platform consists of buy-side, sell-side, creative, data and artificial**
intelligence optimization modules. As a result, Teads has built deep partnerships with both the demand and supply
sides of digital advertising. For advertisers and their agencies, Teads’ platform offers a single access point to buy
the inventory of many of the world’s best publishers. Through exclusive partnerships with these premium
publishers, Teads enables customers to reach 1.9 billion unique monthly users (as of April 2021), while improving
the efficiency, quality and cost of digital ad transactions. For approximately 3,100 publishers, Teads is a trusted
monetization partner, providing the technology required to monetize their most valuable ad inventory
programmatically. By connecting both sides through Teads’ integrated platform, known as the _Teads Global_
_Media Platform, Teads solves the digital programmatic advertising industry’s most significant problems related_
to value chain fragmentation, inefficient digital advertising pricing and quality and scale of inventory. Teads refers
to the ecosystem enabled by Teads Global Media Platform as the curated internet (the “Curated Internet”). For
the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, we generated
revenues from Teads of €488 million. For more information, see “Description of Our Business—Other Services—
_Media”._


-----

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, the Group generated total consolidated revenues of €4,088 million,
of which, without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, €2,148 million, €981 million, €475 million and €488
million was contributed by our Portugal, Israel, Dominican Republic and Teads segments, respectively, and
Adjusted EBITDA of €1,575 million, of which, without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, €828 million,
€343 million, €233 million and €177 million was contributed by our Portugal, Israel, Dominican Republic and
Teads segments, respectively.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that we benefit from the following key strengths:

**_We benefit from an owner-operator culture._**

We are part of a founder-controlled organization with an owner-operator culture and strategy that is focused on
operational efficiency and innovation. In recent years, our management team has moved quickly to, among other
things, streamline business processes, centralize functions and eliminate non-essential overhead expenses,
simplify and redesign our product offerings, drive adoption of higher broadband speeds and continue to build out
and upgrade our fiber/cable and mobile networks across our geographic footprint and enter into strategic
transactions, such as the Towers Transactions and the Altice Portugal FTTH Transaction. We continuously strive
to improve our operational and financial performance, encouraging communication across the organization while
empowering nimble and efficient decision-making that is focused at every level on enhancing the overall customer
experience.

**_We enjoy leading positions in well diversified and attractive markets with favorable dynamics for fiber/cable_**
**_and mobile operators._**

We are the largest or second largest fixed services provider in each of our service areas. We are located in markets
that we believe have a number of attractive trends for cable and mobile operators. Portugal is our largest geography
by revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. In Portugal, we benefit from PT Portugal’s number one market positions in


-----

broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and enterprise telecommunications services and number two market
position in pay TV, which we provide through FastFiber’s fiber network that passed 5,699,000 homes as of March
31, 2021 (including homes accessed through wholesale fiber operators) as well as through DSL and DTH networks.
We are also the largest mobile operator in Portugal. PT Portugal’s mobile network is 4G-LTE enabled, allowing
speeds of up to 400 Mbps and reaching 99.6% of the population, as of March 31, 2021. In Israel, we are the leading
fiber/cable operator with the number one market position in pay TV and number two market position in broadband
internet. We benefit from nationwide fiber/cable network coverage, a unique feature in the cable sector, which we
believe provides us with significant penetration upside potential. Further, in February 2021, HOT became an equal
partner in IBC Partnership, an entity that holds 70% of IBC Israel’s share capital, together with Cellcom and Israel
Infrastructure Fund, and now HOT indirectly holds 23.3% of IBC Israel’s share capital, through an investment of
€45 million. We have entered into an agreement with IBC Israel under which we undertake to purchase an
indefeasible right, or IRU, to use IBC Israel’s fiber-optic network. There is also a service agreement between IBC
Israel and HOT, under which IBC Israel undertakes to purchase certain services from HOT. As of April 2021, we
offer fiber-based internet services in speeds of up to 1 Gbps over IBC Israel’s fiber optic network in certain areas
where the network had already been deployed.

Portugal and Israel have historically had high consumption of fixed and mobile services and we believe that we
are well positioned to meet the growing demand for bandwidth-intensive services and premium content offerings
in the future. The combination of our very-high-speed fiber/cable networks and our 4G and, in Israel, also 5G,
networks enables us to offer attractive flat rate multi-play packages to meet the growing demand for speed and
bandwidth coming from multi-screen households, for usage both in and outside the home.

**_We believe that we benefit from a network advantage in our largest markets, combining highly complementary_**
**_state-of-the-art fixed and mobile networks._**

We believe that we benefit from a fixed network advantage in our largest markets, Portugal and Israel. Our fixedline services in Portugal are primarily delivered over proprietary FTTH, DSL and DTH, and in Israel are primarily
delivered over our proprietary HFC network (and since April 2021, fiber-based internet services are also delivered
over IBC Israel’s fiber optic network in certain areas where the network had already been deployed), in each case
that are among the most technically advanced in the markets in which we operate. In Portugal, we own 50.01%
of FastFiber which in turn owns the largest fiber network in Portugal by penetration that passed 5,699,000 homes
as of March 31, 2021 (including homes accessed through wholesale fiber operators). Pursuant to our fiber rollout
strategy in Portugal, through FastFiber we rolled out 388,000 new fiber homes passed in 2018, 356,000 new fiber
homes passed in 2019, 603,000 new fiber homes passed in 2020 and a further 73,000 fiber homes passed in the
three months ended March 31, 2021. FastFiber connected more than 26,000 and 8,000 additional kilometers of
dark fiber network in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and in the year ended December 31, 2020,
respectively. We believe our state-of-the-art networks allow us to offer attractive and competitive services in terms
of picture quality, speed and connection reliability. We are able to offer download speeds of at least 200 Mbps to
a majority of homes passed in our footprint in Israel and the Dominican Republic. Given the existing technological
capability of our networks, we have been offering download speeds of up to 300 Mbps and 400 Mbps in the
Dominican Republic and Portugal, respectively, and with limited network, expect to offer download speeds of up
to 500 Mbps in Israel, in each case, in certain areas covered by our network. We believe that with our fiber/cable
technologies we are well positioned to meet the anticipated high bandwidth and speed requirements of our
customers. We are also the largest mobile operator in Portugal, with a market-leading 4G-LTE enabled mobile
network capable of delivering download speeds of up to 400 Mbps and reaching 99.6% of the population.

In the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, we incurred Capital Expenditures (Accrued) of €846 million, which
includes network-related capital expenditures to improve our 4G and 5G (in the case of Israel) networks and
continued fiber deployment as well as customer related capital expenditures. We believe our high level of prior
investment and ownership of fiber and cable assets provides us with a greater ability to control costs compared to
our alternative operator competitors, determine the most accurate incremental capital expenditures and generate
higher margins. We have also capitalized on our passive mobile infrastructure in Portugal and the Dominican
Republic by consummating the Towers Transactions. See “Description of our Business—Significant Investments
_and Dispositions”,_ “Description of our Business—Significant Contracts—Dominican Republic—Agreement to
_Dispose of Dominican Tower Assets” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations—Selected Consolidated Cash Flow Data” for more information._


-----

**_We are a primary convergence operator and a leading multi-play provider of fiber/cable- and/or mobile-based_**
**_services in our markets with substantial cross-sell, up-sell and value-add opportunities in fixed and mobile_**
**_services._**

Building on our technologically advanced networks and innovative offerings, we have developed leading positions
in our markets in multi-play offerings by selling our differentiated pay TV, high-speed broadband internet, fixedline telephony, premium content and, in most instances, mobile telephony services as bundles. We believe that
the strength of our fixed and mobile businesses, and our ability to complement these services with premium
content offerings, provide an opportunity to increase the penetration of our multi-play and premium packages.
The demand for high-speed internet, fixed mobile convergence and high-quality content are key drivers of our
cross-sell and up-sell strategy.

We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend as our network has been built and upgraded
specifically to address the increasing speed and bandwidth requirements of our subscribers. We also continue to
offer our existing DSL subscribers the option to subscribe to a fiber/cable offering, which provides an opportunity
to significantly grow penetration on our network and to create upselling opportunities. Migrating existing DSL
subscribers to our fiber/cable network also reduces the costs associated with renting the last mile and enables
funds to be reallocated to accelerate the rollout of our fiber/cable network.

We offer a fully integrated fixed and mobile business in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic. In Portugal,
we have successfully capitalized on cross-selling opportunities through delivery of connected services and we
believe that we are well positioned to benefit further from convergence between fixed and mobile service offerings
by leveraging our high-speed fiber-based fixed network and 4G mobile network. We operate 3G, 4G, and 5G (in
the case of Israel) mobile networks in Israel and the Dominican Republic, which, in each case, benefit from
synergies with our cable networks.

We are also focused on delivering high quality content offerings to complement our fixed and mobile services,
including producing proprietary content. For example, in Portugal, we offer a high-quality content package
through more than 200 channels, most of which are offered in full HD 1080p resolution, and a leading VoD library,
and own a 25% stake in SPORT TV, a sports broadcaster. Between the end of 2015 and early 2016, we entered
into various agreements with other telecom operators and football clubs in Portugal to acquire reciprocal or
exclusive broadcasting rights, including exclusive broadcasting rights to the F.C. Porto matches in the Portuguese
Premier League. In November 2018, we launched a new MEO Series service aimed at broadcasting exclusive and
other important series. Throughout the years 2017 and 2018, we added new channels to our portfolio, some of
which are provided exclusively by us. In 2020, MEO was one of the few operators to have launched TV services
in Apple TV and Android TV OTT SetTop boxes, providing a unique user interface, while maintaining
appreciated features like Fast Zapping and personalized services like Continue Watching. In Israel, we co-develop
and co-own high-quality original local content together with local producers and broadcast it on our proprietary
channels, which supplements other third party content and channels that we broadcast on our network. We have
also entered into various arrangements with Altice France Group’s Altice TV division, including non-exclusive
distribution rights in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic of Netflix and Discovery channels. We believe
that our high-quality proprietary local content along with premium local content that we purchase and/or distribute,
together with our distinctive brand, which serve to differentiate our service offerings from those of our competitors.

**_Benefit of a strong brand and extensive retail distribution network._**

We believe that our strong brands and our retail distribution networks enable us to leverage our extensive fixed
and mobile infrastructure and best-in-class product offerings to drive growth. We continue to invest in
strengthening our brands, such as MEO in Portugal, HOT in Israel and Altice in the Dominican Republic, by
focusing on network reliability and high-quality customer care and believe that our brands benefit from a positive
reputation among our customer base and target customers. We also benefit from a strong distribution network,
including physical and digital channels. Our physical distribution channels include an extensive network of stores
and other physical points of sale, which we believe offer a compelling customer experience by providing prepurchase advice on devices and services, subscriptions and customer support, including after-sales service and
claims. Our online platforms complement our physical network through value-added services, including technical
support and news, and through our online stores, which showcase our product offerings and serve as one of the
main distribution channels for certain of our business services offers. Our multi-channel networks are supported
by our customer service and support teams, which offer a comprehensive range of services covering subscribers’
needs, such as claim management, technical support, loyalty programs and sales. See “Description of Our
_Business—Marketing and Sales”._


-----

**_Cash flow generation._**

We generated Operating Free Cash Flow of €730 million, €740 million and €746 million, respectively, for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2021, the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019.
Operating Free Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative for operating cash flow as presented in the
consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with IAS 7 (Statement of Cash Flows). For further analysis
on cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Selected Consolidated Cash Flow Data”. We believe that our_
large and diversified customer base and predominantly monthly subscription structure provide a certain level of
predictability as to future cash flows. We believe that our ability to generate cash is a direct result of our rigorous
focus on cost optimization and organizational efficiency as well as a prudent capital expenditure policy.

**_We have a proven track record of unlocking value through operational excellence._**

We believe that our entrepreneurial culture and efficient decision making processes allow us to quickly react to
changes in our operating environments and to seize business opportunities as they arise. We believe a key driver
of our success has been our ability to timely implement best operational practices that drive the previously
identified improvements in the profitability of our businesses. In our businesses, we have successfully simplified
organizational structures, reduced management layers, streamlined decision-making processes, optimized costs
and redeployed resources with a focus on network investment, customer service enhancements and marketing
support.

**_We have an experienced management team and supportive shareholder with a proven track record._**

_Experienced management with proven integration track record. We manage our business by combining the_
expertise of the Altice Europe Group’s senior management team with the local expertise of the CEOs and
managers of our operating subsidiaries who have significant experience managing day-to-day operations at cable
and telecommunications companies. The Altice Europe Group cross-deploys talent and expertise across its
businesses, allowing the Group to benefit from the Altice Europe Group’s senior management’s experience around
the world. We believe this diversity of experience differentiates us from our more traditional and localized industry
peers. Our senior management team has extensive experience in the cable and telecommunications industry and
includes Malo Corbin, CFO of Altice Europe and Armando Pereira, COO of Altice Europe. Dennis Lodewijk
Okhuijsen serves as an advisor to Altice Europe on all financing and capital structure activity. For more
information regarding the management of the Group, see “Management and Governance” elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum.

_Strong shareholder support. Altice Europe is supported by an entrepreneurial shareholder, Patrick Drahi, founder_
of Altice, with over 20 years of experience owning and managing cable and telecommunications companies
globally. Mr. Drahi was the President of Altice Europe’s board before the dissolution of the company on July 9,
2021.

**Our Strategy**

We intend to leverage and continue to modernize our advanced networks in order to compete in all market
segments and to address the growing need for high bandwidth, rapid and reliable network access driven by the
digitization of everyday life and business. We intend to continue to offer innovative and differentiated products,
services and content in order to generate growth and improve the user experience. The key components of our
strategy are to:

**_Grow operating margins and cash flow by leveraging our operational expertise._**

We have a successful track record of improving the performance of cable and telecommunication operators. We
expect to continue to streamline processes and service offerings and to improve productivity across geographies
by centralizing our business functions, reorganizing our procurement processes, eliminating duplicative
management functions and overhead, terminating lower-return projects and non-essential consulting and thirdparty service arrangements, optimizing the convergence of our product and service offerings and investing in our
employee relations and our culture across our organization. We aim to continue to focus on achieving operational
efficiencies by (i) investing in our fiber/cable network, migrating existing DSL subscribers to our fiber network
and reducing the need for third party network services, (ii) improving and simplifying operational processes and
reducing IT costs by investing in new platforms, (iii) integrating sales organizations, optimizing our sales channels


-----

and simplifying our brand portfolio, (iv) implementing further procurement efficiencies by leveraging our
bargaining power and (v) further reducing overhead costs.

**_Invest in fixed and mobile infrastructure across our footprint, as well as sales, marketing and innovation, to_**
**_maintain our competitive advantage and provide best-in-class services and user experience to our customers._**

We aim to remain a technology leader in the jurisdictions in which we operate by investing in our fixed
infrastructure including fiber network and mobile networks including 5G. We believe this will enable us to provide
higher bandwidth, innovative and best-in-class services to our subscribers while also enhancing our wholesale
business. For our residential customers, our focus is on new customer platforms and faster data speeds. For our
business customers, we are introducing new value-added services, such as next generation remote voice protocol
services, hosting and cloud services, which require high bandwidth and offer higher margins. For our media clients,
we offer advanced, targeted and multi-screen advertising services and data analytics using our proprietary data
and the advanced technology platforms that we have developed and acquired. We have already invested heavily
in our network, having incurred significant Capital Expenditures (Accrued) of 20.7%, 19.6%, 19.4% and 20.8%
of total consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and the three months ended
March 31, 2021, respectively, a significant portion of which has been spent to improve our mobile network and
roll out new fiber/cable homes. We intend to continue to build up our brands and invest in our networks, services
and new technologies in order to maintain our competitive advantage and position ourselves to grow in the future.

**_Provide a compelling value proposition to residential subscribers in 3P and 4P._**

_Provide high speed broadband, high quality content and superior mobile services to existing and new residential_
_subscribers. We believe that our network leadership, operational excellence and multi-play strategy are key factors_
to our success in the geographies in which we operate. Our strategy is to continue to increase our multi-play
customer penetration. We aim to offer existing and new residential subscribers market-leading 3P and 4P packages
by accelerating investment in both fiber and 5G infrastructure and leveraging our differentiated product offerings,
access to premium content, large customer base and premium brands. Our significant investments in content
services, such as our 25% stake in SPORT TV in Portugal and right to premium content, is evidence of our strategy
to provide premium content across all platforms to complement our fixed and mobile services and thereby drive
bundling and convergence to our multi-play offerings. As of March 31, 2021, the Group had approximately
3,011,000 total fixed B2C unique customers and approximately 10,159,000 total mobile B2C subscribers.

_Leverage our large customer base to up- and cross-sell our fiber/cable, mobile and premium content products as_
_well as gain market share from new customers. Our primary focus is to up- and cross-sell offerings to our existing_
customer base, including fiber/cable, mobile and premium content. We believe that our competitive and
differentiated product offerings will act as natural drivers of up- and cross-selling. For example, we expect the
investments in improvements to our innovative set-top box technology will attract new premium package
customers and prompt existing fixed customers to upgrade to our fiber/cable and premium packages which offer
these products as standard. In addition, we intend to leverage our leading product offerings, brand image and store
network to increase our market share by capturing new subscribers that are in need of higher speeds and bandwidth.

**_Selectively invest in key premium content to enrich our service offerings and differentiate our offerings in the_**
**_market place._**

We plan to invest selectively in premium content and accelerate the development of multimedia projects as part
of our long-term strategy of converging our telecommunications assets with media channels and content
development, production and distribution to offer greater value and differentiated products and services to our
customers. For example, at the end of 2015 and at the beginning of 2016, PT Portugal entered into contracts with
several first and second division football clubs in Portugal, including F.C. Porto, Vitoria F.C., Rio Ave F.C. and
Boavista F.C., to acquire the exclusive broadcasting rights for the home games of these clubs for up to ten football
seasons and in February 2017 we acquired a 25% stake in the capital of the Portuguese sports broadcaster SPORT
TV. In July 2020, PT Portugal entered into a new distribution agreement with SPORT TV for a four-season period.
Further, Altice Dominicana is the exclusive distributor of NBA League Pass and NBA Channel. We believe that
these arrangements will enhance our profile in the market and help us differentiate ourselves from our competitors.

**_Leverage our networks to exploit new growth opportunities, including business services and wholesale markets._**

We believe that our dense fiber/cable networks will position us ideally to service new demand from corporate
customers and to benefit from the convergence of fixed and mobile usage with relatively lower levels of capital


-----

investment compared to some of our peers. We aim to leverage our well-invested infrastructures to offer tailored
data solutions and capture profitable growth in these markets, thereby maximizing the return on our network assets.
As the B2B telecommunications market shifts to next generation services, including IP VPN, hosting and cloud
services, which are more bandwidth intensive and complex and offer higher margins, we will look to
opportunistically expand our business services, which offer important economies of scale and synergies with our
residential operations. A large portion of our fiber/cable network are both powerful and flexible, have the high
capacity bandwidth necessary to offer these next generation services and are fully adaptable to future services that
may require even greater bandwidth capacity and reliability. We intend to capitalize on the combination of our
powerful network and expertise in critical network architecture to grow our customer base and increase our
offering of higher margin next generation and data products and services.

In the first quarter of 2021, FastFiber increased the coverage of its FTTH fiber network by 73,000 new homes
passed, reaching a total coverage of approximately 5,699,000 homes passed (including homes accessed through
wholesale fiber operators) as of March 31, 2021. FastFiber connected more than 26,000 and 8,000 additional
kilometers of dark fiber network in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and in the year ended December 31,
2020, respectively.

In addition, as mobile internet traffic is expected to grow, we believe that our high capacity backbone will
differentiate us from our competitors as it enables us to offer a compelling backhaul offload offering to MVNOs.
In Portugal, we benefit from PT Portugal’s leading enterprise telecommunications infrastructure (including one
of the largest data centers in the world) and strong customer relationships, as well as from its leading 4G mobile
network and superior scale.

**Recent Developments**

**_Omega Sale Transaction_**

On May 26, 2021, PT Portugal entered into an exclusivity agreement with Cellnex Telecom S.A. (“Cellnex”) for
the sale of 100% interest in the business unit to be carved-out including a set of mobile towers and other passive
mobile infrastructure (“Omega”) for an implied enterprise value of approximately €209 million (the “Omega
**Sale Transaction”). The Omega Sale Transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to**
customary regulatory approvals; however there can be no assurance that the Omega Sale Transaction will occur
in a timely manner or at all. The offering of the Notes is not conditioned on the completion of the Omega Sale
Transaction.

Upon completion of the Omega Sale Transaction, PT Portugal or its affiliates will enter into an agreement for the
right to use the carved-out mobile tower infrastructure.

**_Teads IPO Postponement_**

On July 29, 2021, Altice International announced that Teads has postponed plans for its initial public offering due
to unsatisfactory equity market conditions as compared to the growth prospects of the company.

**Trading Update**

Based on preliminary results, the Group’s revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was between €1,039
million and €1,060 million, an increase in the range of 10.1% to 12.3% from €944 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2020. The increase in the Group’s revenue was mainly driven by revenue increases in Portugal
and Teads. For the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020, the
Group’s revenue in Portugal increased in a range of 9.1% to 11.4%, from €499 million (for the three months ended
June 30, 2020) to between €545 million and €556 million. This was supported by service revenue growth in the
residential segment. As expected, roaming revenue increased year over year in both the residential and B2B
segments, given the very low level of roaming in the second quarter of 2020. The Group’s revenue in Israel
decreased between 2.9% and 0.9% in the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended
June 30, 2020. In addition, revenue for the Dominican Republic increased in the range of 1.2% to 3.2%. Both for
Israel and the Dominican Republic, the depreciation of the shekel and peso, respectively, versus the euro, impacted
the year over year trends on a reported basis. Teads revenue grew between 67.5% and 70.9% for the three months
ended June 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020, from €82 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2020 to a range of €138 million to €141 million for the three months June 30, 2021, due to a strong
commercial performance.


-----

Based on preliminary results, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2021, was in a
range of €396 million to €404 million, an increase between 4.7% and 6.8% from €378 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2020. The increase in the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA was mainly driven by Adjusted EBITDA
increases in Portugal and Teads. Portugal EBITDA increased between 4.8% and 6.9%, driven by the increase in
revenues year over year in both the residential and business segments and cost control. Teads EBITDA increased
by a range of 104.3% to 108.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the three months
ended June 30, 2020.

Based on preliminary results, the Group’s Capital Expenditures (Accrued) for the three months ended June 30,
2021 was between €205 million and €209 million, an increase between 0.2% and 2.2% compared to €204 million
for the three months ended June 30, 2020. As a consequence, the Operating Free Cash Flow for the three months
ended June 30, 2021, grew, by a range of 10.0% to 12.3%, to between €191 million and €195 million, compared
to €174 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020.

The Group’s total third-party financial debt (after currency impact of derivative instruments) less cash and cash
equivalents, as of the three months ended June 30, 2021, as adjusted for the cash proceeds in an amount of €375
million expected to be received in December 2021 from the Altice Portugal FTTH Transaction, was €6,752 million.

The above information is based solely on preliminary results and is not intended to be a comprehensive statement
of our financial or operational results for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The preliminary information
provided herein is based on information available to management of the Group as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum. The information for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 is based on the Group management’s internal
reporting and is subject to adjustment for quarter-end closing procedures. Therefore, the above information may
be subject to modification during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and review thereof by
our independent auditors. Accordingly, our actual results for the three months ended June 31, 2021 may vary from
our preliminary results above, and such variations could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance
on them. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion of certain of the
factors that could affect our future performance and results of operations.

On March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a global
pandemic, highlighting the health risks of the disease. There have been extraordinary and wide ranging actions
taken by national, regional and local governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of
the virus. In this context and following regulatory requirements published by the local governments in jurisdictions
in which we operate over the last year, the Group activated a response program in order to ensure the health and
safety of, and minimize the impact of the pandemic on, our employees, customers, business and operations. Please
refer to Note 1.4 of the 2020 Financial Statements for more information.

We have continued to provide our telecommunications services to our customers during this pandemic. The
COVID-19 pandemic had a limited impact on the annual consolidated financial statements of the Group for the
year ended December 31, 2020 demonstrating the resilience of the Group’s business model. The Group has been
impacted by a decline in handset sales in the context of the closure of shops in countries where the Group operates
and a decrease in roaming revenue due to decreased travel. Although the situation continues to evolve, the Group
expects that the COVID-19 pandemic will have limited effects on the Group’s operations and financial
performance for future periods.

In countries where the Group operates, the Group did not benefit from specific programs that required compliance
with particular conditions.

_Competition—Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the recent_
_COVID-19 pandemic”._

**_Take-Private Transaction_**

On September 11, 2020, Altice Europe N.V. and Next Private B.V. (the “Offeror” or “Next Private”), a direct
subsidiary of Next Alt S.à r.l. (“Next Alt”), the controlling shareholder of Altice Europe N.V., announced that a


-----

conditional agreement had been reached relating to a recommended public offer (the “Offer”) to be made by the
Offeror for all common shares A and common shares B of Altice Europe N.V. (each, a “Target Share”). The
Offer was launched on November 25, 2020 and expired on January 21, 2021 (the “Offer Period”). As per the
terms of the Offer, as amended, each minority shareholder who tendered in the Offer would receive cash
consideration (cum dividend) equal to €5.35 per Target Share tendered (the “Offer Price”). The shareholders of
Altice Europe N.V. approved the resolutions relating to the Offer at the extraordinary general meeting held on
January 7, 2021.

At the expiry of the Offer Period, 90.89% of the listed shares of Altice Europe N.V., not already held by the
Offeror, were tendered and the settlement of the Offer was completed on January 26, 2021. Following the
consummation of the settlement of the Offer, the Offeror held 95.11% of the listed shares of Altice Europe N.V.
and approximately 92.02% of the total issued share capital of Altice Europe N.V. The Offeror then consummated
the post-Offer merger, pursuant to which (i) Altice Europe N.V. ceased to exist following its merger into New
Altice Europe B.V., an entity created in connection with the post-Offer merger and the surviving entity of such
post-Offer merger (under the terms of a triangular merger), (ii) Altice Europe N.V.’s listing on the Euronext
Amsterdam was terminated on January 27, 2021 and (iii) an advance liquidation distribution was made to the nontendering shareholders of Altice Europe N.V. on January 29, 2021 in an amount equal to the Offer Price per nontendered share. As a result of these transactions, New Altice Europe B.V. became a privately held company. On
July 9, 2021, Next Private, being the sole shareholder of New Altice Europe B.V., resolved to dissolve New Altice
Europe B.V. and to commence the liquidation process. All members of the board of directors of New Altice
Europe B.V. have been appointed as liquidators. The liquidation will be effective after the expiry of a two-month
creditor opposition period, and subject to completion of the corporate and registration formalities. As of the date
of this Offering Memorandum, Next Private owns indirectly 92.8% of the shares of Altice International and the
Issuer. The transactions described above are referred to herein as the “Take-Private Transaction”.

**The Refinancing Transactions**

We intend to use the proceeds of this offering of the Notes to (i) refinance in full the outstanding Altice Financing
2026 Notes, (ii) pay associated call premiums, fees, costs and expenses, and (iii) add cash on balance sheet
(collectively, the “Refinancing Transactions”). See “Use of Proceeds”.

**The Issuer**

The Issuer was incorporated as a public limited liability company (société anonyme) under the laws of
Luxembourg on August 17, 2012 and is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Altice Finco, which is in turn a
wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Altice International. The registered office (siège social) of the Issuer is at 5,
rue Eugène Ruppert, L-2453 Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Issuer is registered with the
Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register under number B-171162. The Issuer’s business operations include
only managing the financing activities of the Group.

The Issuer’s ability to pay principal, interest and premium, if any, on the Notes, is dependent, in large part, upon
payments received from the Group pursuant to the proceeds loans made to certain Restricted Subsidiaries. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—The Issuer is a special purpose vehicle company
_with limited assets other than its interests in certain proceeds loans and is dependent upon cash from Altice_
_International and its subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the Notes” and “Simplified_ _Corporate and_
_Financing Structure” for more information._

**Principal Shareholder**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum and following the completion of the Take-Private Transaction, Next
Private, a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) incorporated
under the laws of the Netherlands, registered with the Dutch Trade Registry under number 80275613, having its
corporate seat at Oostsingel 1, 3441 GB Woerden, the Netherlands, owns, through its direct and indirect

**SIMPLIFIED CORPORATE AND FINANCING STRUCTURE**

The following diagram summarizes our expected corporate and financing structure after giving effect to the
Refinancing Transactions. The following is provided for indicative and illustration purposes only, does not include
all of our subsidiaries or liabilities, and should be read in conjunction with the information contained elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum. For a summary of the debt obligations referred to in the following diagram, see
“Capitalization”, “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes”.

(1) Next Private owns, through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, 92.8% of the share capital of Altice International and the Issuer. See
“General Description of Our Business and The Offering—Significant Developments—Take-Private Transaction”.

(2) The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors. The Notes will further benefit from the Senior Secured
Collateral as described under “—Summary Description of Guarantees and Security” below. The Senior Secured Collateral securing
the Notes also secures the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior Secured Debt on a first-ranking basis. In
addition, the security interests in the Senior Secured Collateral will, in some cases, be first-ranking and, in other cases, junior
ranking. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holder and/or lenders under the Notes and the existing Senior
Secured Debt will share in recoveries from the enforcement of the security interests over the Senior Secured Collateral, subject to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (whether or not such indebtedness is directly secured by all or any of the Senior Secured
Collateral). Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of an enforcement of the Senior Secured Collateral securing
the Notes, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Senior Secured Collateral only after the lenders under the 2015
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging agreements have been repaid in full. The obligations
of each Guarantor under its guarantee of the Senior Secured Debt and the security interests in the Senior Secured Collateral will
be limited as necessary to prevent the applicable guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, or
otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law or capital maintenance regulations. The guarantees of Altice Portugal, PT
Portugal and PT OpCo are also subject to the Aggregate Portuguese Security and Guarantee Limit, as applicable. In addition, the
Guarantees and the security interests in the Senior Secured Collateral may be released under certain circumstances, including in
connection with certain transactions intended to simplify the Group’s corporate structure. See “Limitation on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests”, “The Offering” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and_
_the Structure”._

(3) The Restricted Group for the Notes does not include Altice Finco. The Altice Finco 2028 Notes are guaranteed on a senior
subordinated basis by the Issuer and the Guarantors and will benefit from collateral consisting of (i) a first-ranking pledge over all
of the share capital of Altice Finco, (ii) second-ranking pledges over all of the share capital of the Issuer, Cool Holding and Altice


-----

Holdings, (iii) a second-ranking pledge over the Cool Shareholder Loan and (iv) second-ranking pledges of the proceeds loans
from Altice Finco to the Issuer.

(4) The Senior Secured Collateral includes a pledge of the HOT Proceeds Notes as a result of which the Senior Secured Debt will also
indirectly benefit from the guarantees and security provided by HOT and certain of its subsidiaries under the HOT Proceeds Notes
(up to the amount outstanding under the HOT Proceeds Notes). The HOT Proceeds Notes are guaranteed by the HOT Proceeds
Note Guarantors and secured by a pledge over substantially all of the assets of HOT (including all of the share capital of HOT
Mobile) and the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantors but, in each case, excluding licenses granted by the Israeli Ministry of
Communications and certain end-user equipment, with respect to which HOT is not permitted to grant a security interest (the “HOT
**Proceeds Note Collateral”). If there is an event of default under the Notes or the other Senior Secured Debt, HOT and the HOT**
Proceeds Note Guarantors will only be liable to the holders of the Notes and the other Senior Secured Debt if there is also an event
of default continuing under the HOT Proceeds Notes, indirectly as a result of an assignment of the HOT Proceeds Notes and/or the
ability of the holders of the Notes and the other Senior Secured Debt to direct the actions of the Issuer in connection with such
assignment in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent permitted thereby. As of March 31, 2021,
the amount outstanding under the HOT Proceeds Notes was NIS 1,900,000,000.

(5) HOT Mobile is not a guarantor or security provider under the HOT Proceeds Notes. In connection with its mobile business, HOT
Mobile has provided a bank guarantee to the State of Israel in an outstanding amount of NIS 22 million, which is secured by a
pledge of all of its assets.

(6) Primarily includes Teads (in which Altice International directly and indirectly owns 96.8% of the share capital and voting rights)
and ATS. Also includes Auberimmo, which will be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

(7) The Guarantors, on an aggregated basis (after intersegment eliminations), contributed 64.0% and 67.2% to the Group’s revenues
and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, and 74.5% to the Group’s total assets as of
March 31, 2021. The Guarantors, HOT and the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantors, on an aggregated basis (after intersegment
eliminations), contributed 88.0% and 90.3% to the Group’s revenues and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2021, and 89.8% to the Group’s total assets as of March 31, 2021.

(8) As of March 31, 2021, as adjusted for the Refinancing Transactions, including offering of the Notes hereby and the application of
proceeds therefrom, Altice International and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis would have had €6,863 million of
total third-party senior secured debt (after currency impact of derivative instruments) and €7,690 million of total third-party
financial debt (after currency impact of derivative instruments), in each case, as presented under “Capitalization”. The Restricted
Group for the Notes does not include Altice Finco and Auberimmo, which are Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

(9) The Issuer’s business operations include only managing the financing activities of the Group. The Issuer’s ability to pay principal,
interest and premium, if any, on the Notes, is dependent, in large part, upon payments received from the Group pursuant to the
proceeds loans made to certain Restricted Subsidiaries. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—The
_Issuer is a special purpose vehicle company with limited assets other than its interests in certain proceeds loans and is dependent_
_upon cash from Altice International and its subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the Notes” for more information._

(10) In April 2020, we transferred our fiber assets in Portugal including FTTH and dark fiber to FastFiber. On April 17, 2020, we
disposed of a 49.99% interest in FastFiber to Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners (“Altice Portugal FTTH Transaction”).

**Summary Description of Guarantees and Security**

The following is a summary of certain aspects of the Guarantees and the “Senior Secured Collateral” related to
the Notes. The Guarantees and the Senior Secured Collateral related to the Notes are complex and subject to
significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and
_the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure”. In the event that the_
Issuer or the relevant grantor of security is required to enter into new or amended Security Documents in order to
provide security for its obligations under the Notes or the Guarantees, as applicable, such Security Documents
will be entered into within 30 Business Days after the Issue Date.

Collateral only after the lenders under the 2015 Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging agreements have been

Dollar Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a makewhole premium. The Issuer may redeem some or all of the Dollar Notes at

-----

principal amount plus a specified premium, accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any. See “Description of Notes—Optional
_Redemption”._

In addition, prior to August 15, 2024, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes (including the principal
amount of additional Dollar Notes) with the proceeds of certain specified
equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 105.750% of the principal
amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to (but excluding) the redemption date, provided that at
least 60% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes

outstanding after the redemption and the redemption occurs within 180
days after the closing of such equity offering. See “Description of Notes—
_Optional Redemption”._

**Additional Amounts; Tax**
**Redemption ................................** All payments made under or in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees will
be made without withholding or deduction for any taxes, except to the
extent required by law. If such withholding or deduction is required by law
in any relevant tax jurisdiction, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as
applicable, will, subject to certain limitations, pay additional amounts so
that the net amount received by each holder or beneficial owner is no less
than that which it would have received in the absence of such withholding
or deduction. See “Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes”.

In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may
redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption
price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, and additional amounts, if any, to (but excluding) the date of
redemption. See “Description of Notes—Redemption for Changes in
_Withholding Taxes”._

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax**
**Considerations ...........................** The Notes may be treated as having been issued with original issue
discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An obligation generally is
treated as having been issued with original issue discount if its stated
principal amount exceeds its issue price by at least a defined de minimis
amount. If a Note is treated as issued with original issue discount, investors
subject to U.S. federal income tax will be subject to tax on that original
issue discount as ordinary income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt
of cash payments attributable to that income (and in addition to qualified
stated interest). You are urged to consult your own tax advisors with
respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax considerations
related to purchasing, owning and disposing of the Notes. For a discussion
of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations, see “Certain Tax
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”._

**Certain ERISA Considerations ...** The Notes and any interest therein may, subject to certain restrictions
described herein under “Certain Employee Benefit Plan Considerations”,
be sold and transferred to ERISA Plans (as defined in this Offering
Memorandum). See “Certain Employee Benefit Plan Considerations”.

(1) The Group has adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method of adoption with the date of initial application of January
1, 2019. The comparative financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the 2019 Financial Statements
has not been restated for the impacts of IFRS 16. See Notes 1.3.3 and 2.12 to the 2019 Financial Statements, included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum, for more information.

(2) For the year ended December 31, 2018, “Others” included the FOT Business (until the completion of the sale of the FOT Business
on October 31, 2018), datacenter operations in Switzerland (until the completion of the sale of the telecommunications solutions
business and data center operations in Switzerland, green.ch AG and Green Datacenter AG, to InfraVia Capital Partners on
February 12, 2018), and i24 US LLC, which was as a subsidiary of i24 US Corp. until April 23, 2018. ATS France and ACS, which
were sold to Altice France on May 16, 2018, were reported as discontinued and not reported under any segments. Altice TV (until
the sale to Altice Group Lux on May 15, 2018) is reported as a separate operating segment for the year ended December 31, 2018.
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, “Others” included mainly corporate entities.

(3) For definition of Adjusted EBITDA, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures”. We believe
this measure is useful to readers of Historical Consolidated Financial Information as it provides a measure of operating results
excluding certain items that the Group’s management believe are either outside of its recurring operating activities, or items that
are non-cash. Excluding such items enables trends in the Group’s operating results and cash flow generation to be more easily
observable. The Non-IFRS Measures are used by the Group internally to manage and assess the results of its operations, make
decisions with respect to investments and allocation of resources, and assess the performance of management personnel. Such
performance measures are also the de facto metrics used by investors and other members of the financial community to value other
companies operating in the same industry as the Group and thus are a basis for comparability between the Group and its peers.
Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating profit as the effects of depreciation, amortization and


-----

impairment excluded from this measure do ultimately affect the operating results, which is also presented within the annual
consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 1 (Presentation of Financial Statements).

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves risks. Before purchasing the Notes, you should consider carefully the specific_
_risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum. If any of_
_the events described below, individually or in combination, were to occur, this could have a material adverse_
_impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and_
_could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of the Notes. Described below and elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum are the risks considered to be the most material, although there may be other unknown or_
_unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could also have material adverse_
_effects on our results of operations, financial condition, business or operations in the future. In addition, our past_
_financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be_
_used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking_
_statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these_
_forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in_
_this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-Looking Statements”._

_In this section, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Group” “we” “us” and “our” refer to Altice_
_International and its subsidiaries._

**Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile**

**_Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and_**
**_prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations under the Notes or impede our ability to raise additional capital_**
**_to fund our operations._**

We have significant outstanding debt and debt service requirements and may incur additional debt in the future.
As of March 31, 2021, as adjusted for the Refinancing Transactions, including the offering of the Notes hereby
and the application of the proceeds therefrom, the Group had total third-party financial debt (after currency impact
of derivative instruments) as presented under “Capitalization” of €7,690 million.

Our significant level of debt could have important consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:

- requiring that a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to servicing debt, thereby
reducing the funds available to us to finance our operations, capital expenditures, research and development
and other business activities, including maintaining the quality of and upgrading our network;

- impeding our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, including financing for capital expenditures,
and increasing the cost of any such funding, particularly due to the financial and other restrictive covenants
contained in the agreements governing our debt;

- impeding our ability to compete with other providers of pay-TV, broadband internet services, fixed line
telephony services, mobile services and business services in the regions in which we operate;

- restricting us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions or investments, including those
aimed at modernizing our network;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, a business slowdown or to adverse
economic or industry conditions;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive and
economic environment in which we operate; and

- adversely affecting the public perception of the Group and its brands.

Any of these factors or their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt
obligations under the Notes.

The terms of the agreements and instruments governing our debt restrict, but do not prohibit, us from incurring
additional debt. We may refinance our outstanding debt or increase our consolidated debt for various business
reasons, which might include, among other things, financing acquisitions, funding the prepayment premiums, if


-----

any, on the debt that we refinance, funding distributions to our shareholders or general corporate purposes. In the
event that we incur additional debt, the related risks that we now face will intensify.

**_We may not generate sufficient cash flow to fund our capital expenditures, ongoing operations and debt_**
**_obligations, and may be subject to certain tax liabilities._**

Our ability to service our debt and to fund our ongoing operations will depend on our ability to generate cash
flows. We cannot provide any assurance that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flows from operations
or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt
obligations when due. Our ability to generate cash flow and to fund our capital expenditures, ongoing operations
and debt service obligations is dependent on many factors, including:

- our future operating performance;

- the demand and price levels for our current and planned products and services;

- our ability to maintain the level of technical capacity required on our networks and in the subscriber
equipment and other relevant equipment connected to our networks;

- our ability to successfully introduce new products and services;

- our ability to reduce the churn rate;

- general economic conditions and other conditions affecting consumer spending;

- competition;

- sufficient distributable reserves, as required under applicable law;

- the outcome of certain litigation/disputes in which we are involved; and

- legal, tax and regulatory developments affecting our business.

Some of these factors are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we might not be
able to repay our debt, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital
needs, including capital expenditures. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations, we might have to sell
assets, attempt to restructure or refinance our existing debt or seek additional funding in the form of debt or equity
capital. We may not be able to do so on satisfactory terms, if at all.

We expect that a portion of our cash flow will consist of payments of dividends or interest by Israeli companies
in our Group. In general, payments of dividends or interest by companies that are Israeli residents for tax purposes
are subject to withholding tax. With respect to payments to Luxembourg tax residents or residents of other
countries which have a tax treaty with Israel, such withholding tax may be reduced from the rates generally
applicable under Israeli law to the rates applicable under the tax treaty between Israel and Luxembourg or the
other applicable treaty. In order to enjoy the reduced rate of withholding tax, it is necessary to file with the Israel
Tax Authority, a request for relief from withholding prior to payment of the dividend and/or interest. If a
withholding tax exemption or relief certificate is received from the Israel Tax Authority prior to the payment of
the dividend and/or interest, the payer will be able to make the dividend/interest payment at such reduced
withholding tax rate. However, if such request is denied or delayed and such certificate is not available at the time
of payment, withholding will be made at the full statutory rates. Any changes in the tax rates on dividends or
interest could significantly affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations under the Notes. In addition,
payments of dividends by companies resident or not in the Dominican Republic as well as payment of interests
paid to non-resident companies are subject to a withholding tax of 10%.


-----

**_The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain, and the Indenture will contain, restrictions and_**
**_limitations that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business._**

The terms of the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain, and the Indenture will contain, a number
of significant covenants or other provisions that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. These
covenants restrict, or will restrict, our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to, among other things:

- pay dividends or make other distributions;

- make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures;

- engage in transactions with affiliates and other related parties;

- dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business;

- merge with other companies;

- incur additional debt and grant guarantees;

- repurchase or redeem equity interests and subordinated debt or issue shares of subsidiaries; and

- grant liens and pledge assets.

All of these limitations are, or will be, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, including the ability to pay
dividends, make investments or to make significant prepayments of shareholder debt. However, these covenants
could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business
opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, our ability to comply with these restrictions
may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, we are also subject to the affirmative covenants
contained in certain of the debt agreements we are party to, which require us to maintain specified leverage ratios,
see “Description of Other Indebtedness”. Our ability to meet these leverage ratios may be affected by events
beyond our control and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these ratios.

In addition to limiting our flexibility in operating our business, the breach of any covenants or obligations under
the agreements and instruments governing our debt may result in a default under the applicable debt agreement or
instrument and could trigger the acceleration of related debt, which in turn could trigger defaults under agreements
governing our other debt. A default under any of the agreements governing our other debt could materially
adversely affect our growth, financial condition and results of operations.

**_A substantial amount of our indebtedness will mature before the Notes, and we may not be able to repay this_**
**_indebtedness or refinance such indebtedness at maturity on favorable terms, or at all._**

Of the €7,690 million of total third-party financial debt (after currency impact of derivative instruments) as
presented under “Capitalization” we had outstanding as of March 31, 2021, as adjusted for the Refinancing
Transactions, including the offering of the Notes hereby and the application of the proceeds therefrom, it is
expected that all outstanding borrowings will mature prior to the maturity dates of Notes offered hereby. See
“Capitalization”.

Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, will depend, in part, on our financial
condition at the time of any contemplated refinancing. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher
interest rates than our current debt and we may be required to comply with more onerous financial and other
covenants, which could further restrict our business operations and may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of the Notes. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness as it comes due on commercially acceptable terms or at all
and, in connection with the refinancing of our debt or otherwise, we may seek additional refinancing, dispose of
certain assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.


-----

**_We are exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect our debt service obligations._**

We are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Altice Financing Term Loans,
Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities and Altice Financing Guarantee Facilities. In addition, any additional
amounts we borrow under certain revolving credit facilities will bear interest at a floating rate. See “Description
_of Other Indebtedness”. An increase in the interest rates on our debt will reduce the funds available to repay our_
debt and to finance our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities. Although we enter into
various derivative transactions to manage our exposure to movements in interest rates, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost. There can be no guarantee that our hedging strategies
will adequately protect us from the effects of interest rate fluctuation, or that these hedges will not limit any benefit
that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in interest rates.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of
governments and the EU are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection
with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting
to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of
rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international
regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July
2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial
contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016.
Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change,
with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or
there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on March 5, 2021, the UK Financial
Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that certain LIBOR settings will permanently cease immediately after
December 31, 2021 or after June 30, 2023, as applicable (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement
indicates that the FCA will no longer require any panel banks to continue to submit LIBOR beyond the date from
which the panel banks have notified their departure, or to require the ICE Benchmark Association to continue to
publish LIBOR on the basis of panel banks submissions beyond such dates. It follows that all LIBOR settings will
either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after the dates set out
in the FCA Announcement. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association further announced on March 5,
2021 that the FCA Announcement constitutes an index cessation event under the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement
and the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol for all LIBOR settings.

The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of
administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to
the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and
conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including, but not
limited to, the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities, the Altice Financing Term Loans and/or and Altice
Financing Guarantee Facilities having interest rates that are linked to LIBOR or EURIBOR, as applicable). Any
such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged
increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that
bears interest at floating rates of interest.

**_Changes or uncertainty in respect of LIBOR may affect our sources of funding._**

Some of our sources of funding are linked to LIBOR. Various interest rate benchmarks (including LIBOR) are
the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective while
others are still to be implemented, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, as
amended). In addition, the FCA Announcement indicates that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided
by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021 or June 30, 2023, as
applicable. On November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market Working Group
on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over
Night Index Average rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is
established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA
have stated that a key near-term priority for the Working Group will be to make recommendations relating to the
potential development of term SONIA reference rates. These reforms and other pressures may cause such
benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology
or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain
benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, investors should in
particular be aware that:


-----

- any of the reforms or pressures described above or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark
(including LIBOR) could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more
volatile than it would otherwise be; and

- from the cessation date of LIBOR, the rate of interest applicable to our sources of funding may be determined
for a period by applicable fall-back provisions, although such provisions, often being dependent in part upon
the provision by reference banks of offered quotations for the LIBOR rate, may not operate as intended
(depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time) and may
in certain circumstances result in the effective application of a fixed rate based on the rate which applied in
the previous period when LIBOR was available.

More generally, any of the above matters or any other significant change to the setting or existence of LIBOR
could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our sources of funding and/or could have a material adverse
effect on the liquidity of, and the amount payable under, our sources of funding. Changes in the manner of
administration of LIBOR could result in adjustments to the conditions applicable to our sources of funding or
other consequences relevant to our sources of funding. No assurance can be provided that changes will not be
made to LIBOR or any other relevant benchmark rate and/or that such benchmarks will continue to exist.

**_Currency fluctuations and interest rate and other hedging risks could adversely affect our financial results._**

Our business is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. HOT’s primary transactional currency is the
NIS. The primary transactional currency of PT Portugal and its subsidiaries is the euro. The primary transactional
currency of Altice Dominicana is DOP. The primary transactional currency of Teads is the local currency of the
relevant jurisdiction. As a result, our reported results of operations can be significantly different compared to the
results of our businesses, particularly in Israel and the Dominican Republic on a local currency basis. We conduct,
and will continue to conduct, transactions in currencies other than such primary transactional currencies,
particularly the U.S. dollar. Our existing debt is primarily denominated in U.S. dollar, euro and NIS although the
amounts incurred in euros and NIS do not necessarily match the cash flows generated from operations in such
currencies. The exchange rate between U.S. dollars and NIS, the U.S dollars and euro and U.S. dollars and DOP,
which affect our operations, and the euro and NIS and euro and DOP, which affect the translation risk relating to
the consolidation of our financial statements, has been volatile in the past and may continue to be so in the future.
Moreover, the government of the Dominican Republic has imposed exchange controls and currency restrictions
in the past and may do so in the future. This is beyond our control and may result in the DOP ceasing to be freely
convertible or transferable abroad to service our then outstanding indebtedness or otherwise, or the DOP being
significantly depreciated relative to other currencies, including the U.S. dollar, which may impede our ability to
service our outstanding obligations and affect our earnings and cash flow. We have historically covered a portion
of our U.S. dollar and euro cash outflows arising on anticipated and committed obligations through the use of
foreign exchange derivative instruments. Further, while we manage the risk of certain currency fluctuations in
respect of a portion of our existing debt and to hedge some of our exposure to interest rate changes in respect of
indebtedness linked to interest rates, these arrangements may be costly and may not insulate us completely from
such exposure. There can be no guarantee that our hedging strategies will adequately protect our operating results
from the effects of exchange rate fluctuation or changes in interest rates, or that these hedges will not limit any
benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in exchange rates or interest rates.

**_Negative changes in our credit rating and future ratings downgrades of sovereign debt may have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our financial condition._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect
the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other
factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities
and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be
given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered
or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely
affect the value and trading of such Notes.

A downgrade in our credit rating may negatively affect our ability to obtain future financing to fund our operations
and capital needs, which may affect our liquidity. It may also increase our financing costs by increasing the interest
rates of our outstanding debt or the interest rates at which we are able to refinance existing debt or incur additional


-----

debt. In December 2018, the corporate family ratings of Altice International were downgraded by Moody’s from
B1 to B2. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the corporate family ratings of Altice International remain
at B2 with Moody’s and B with Standard & Poor. There can be no assurance that the Group’s corporate rating, or
the instrument rating with respect to the Notes, will be maintained at existing levels. See “Risks Relating to the
_Notes and the Structure—Credit ratings may not reflect all risks”._

Our credit rating may be impacted by a number of factors, including the effects of the economic conditions in the
countries in which we operate and any future rating downgrades of the sovereign debt of these countries. For
example, against the backdrop of the Eurozone crisis, Portuguese sovereign debt was consecutively downgraded
by the rating agencies.

Because the financial condition, revenues and profitability of our operating subsidiaries are closely linked to the
economies of their countries of operations, we expect that the Group as a whole will also be impacted by any
downgrading in the sovereign debt rating of such countries. Any deterioration in the economic condition of the
other countries in which we operate or any ratings downgrade of sovereign debt of these countries may have a
material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Relating to Our Business, Technology and Competition**

**_We face significant competition in each of the industries in which we operate and competitive pressures could_**
**_have a material adverse effect on our business._**

We face significant competition from market incumbents and new competitors in each of our operating segments
and operational activities. The nature and level of the competition that we face varies in each operating segment
and for each of the products and services that we offer. For our fixed-based services, our competitors include, but
are not limited to, providers of television, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and business services using
DSL or fiber connections, providers of television services using technologies such as IPTV and satellite, DTT
providers, mobile network operators, providers of emerging digital entertainment technologies and other providers
of wholesale carrier, infrastructure and white label services. For our mobile services we face competition from
other mobile operators who own and operate a mobile network as well as from providers of VoIP and MVNOs.
For our wholesale services our key competitors include, but are not limited to, wholesale providers of voice, data
and fiber services.

In some instances, our competitors may have easier access to financing, more comprehensive product ranges,
lower financial leverage, greater financial, technical, marketing and personnel resources, larger subscriber bases,
wider geographical coverage for their fixed or mobile networks, greater brand name recognition and experience
or longer established relationships with regulatory authorities, suppliers and customers. Some of our competitors
may have fewer regulatory burdens with which they are required to comply because, among other reasons, they
use different technologies to provide their services, do not own their own fixed-line network, or are not subject to
obligations applicable to operators with significant market power.

There has been a trend of consolidation of telecommunications operations in certain of the countries in which we
operate. Mergers, joint ventures and alliances among franchised, wireless or private cable operators, satellite
providers, local exchange carriers and other telecommunication service providers in the jurisdictions in which we
operate may provide additional benefits to some of our competitors, for example via access to financing, resources,
efficiencies of scale or the ability to provide multiple services in direct competition with us. Public-private joint
ventures may also increase competition. In relation to the Teads segment, some advertisers and agencies have
their own relationships with publishers or are seeking to establish such relationships, and may choose to buy
advertising inventory directly from them rather than leverage all the capabilities of our platform.

As a consequence of the telecommunications and mobile markets reaching saturation in certain geographies where
we operate, there are a limited number of new subscribers entering the market and therefore in order to increase
our subscriber base and market share, we are dependent on attracting our competitors’ existing subscribers, which
intensifies the competitive pressures that we are subject to. Moreover, the competitive landscape in our operating
segments is generally characterized by increasing competition, tiered offerings that include lower priced entrylevel products and a focus on multi-play offerings, including special promotions and discounts for customers who
subscribe for multi-play services. We expect additional competitive pressure from media and telecommunications
industries that seek to offer packages of fixed-based and mobile voice, internet and video broadcast services. In
addition, we expect competition to increase as a result of changes to the regulatory regimes in the markets in


-----

which we operate, such as those attempting to increase competition by allowing third party access to cable
networks on a wholesale basis.

The telecommunications services industry has undergone significant technological development over time and
these changes continue to affect our business. Such changes have had, and will continue to have, a profound
impact on consumer expectations and behavior. Our products and services are also subject to increasing
competition from alternative new technologies or improvements in existing technologies. For example, our pay
TV services in certain jurisdictions compete with IPTV service providers in our network areas utilizing DSL or
VDSL broadband internet connections. In the broadband internet market, we face competition from mobile
operators that are increasingly utilizing a combination of progressively powerful handsets and high bandwidth
technologies, such as universal mobile telecommunications system (“UMTS”) and LTE technology. Mobile
services providers, including those offering advanced, high speed, high bandwidth technologies and MVNOs also
contribute to the competitive pressures that we face in our fixed-based telephony business. In the past, mobile
operators have engaged in ‘cord-cutting’ campaigns and have used attractive mobile calling tariffs to encourage
customers with both fixed-line and mobile services to retain only their mobile services. This substitution, in
addition to the increasing use of alternative communications technologies, negatively affects our fixed-line call
usage volumes and subscriber growth. At the same time, incumbent fixed-line operators have also applied
resources to ‘win back’ activities that can entice our existing telephony customers, as well as prospective
telephony customers, to return or remain with the incumbent by offering certain economic incentives.

The Group’s products and services are also subject to increasing competition from alternative new technologies
or improvements in existing technologies. New players from sectors that are either unregulated or subject to
different regulations (including internet players such as Yahoo!, Google, Disney+, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple,
YouTube, Netflix and other audiovisual players, media players and “over the top” (“OTT”) (of an existing
broadband internet network) players) have also emerged as competitors to our video content offering. These
players are taking advantage of improved connectivity and platform agnostic technologies to offer OTT and cloudbased services. Telecommunications operators are expected to maintain traditional access services and billing
relationships over which users access services from adjacent players such as well-known companies offering
music, video, photos, apps and retail. The rapid success of audio-visual content streamed through the
telecommunications network and insufficient innovation could lead to the emergence of other content or service
providers as well as the saturation of the market, which would put pressure on the revenues and margins of
operators like us, while simultaneously requiring us to increase capital expenditures to remain competitive, which
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Moreover, we are also facing competition from non-traditional mobile voice and data services based on new
mobile internet technologies, in particular OTT applications, such as Skype, Google Talk, FaceTime, Viber and
WhatsApp. These OTT applications are often free of charge, accessible via smartphones and allow their users to
have access to potentially unlimited messaging and voice services over the internet, thus bypassing more
expensive traditional voice and messaging services, such as SMS and MMS, provided by mobile network
operators who are only able to charge the internet data usage for such services. All telecommunications operators
are currently competing with OTT service providers who leverage existing infrastructures and operate capitallight business models, enhancing their ability to compete with businesses, such as ours, which operate capitalintensive business models. OTT service providers have over the past years become more sophisticated and
technological developments have led to a significant improvement in the quality of service, particularly in speech
quality. In addition, players with strong brand capability and financial strength, such as Apple, Google, Facebook
and Microsoft, have turned their attention to the provision of OTT audio and data services. In the long term, if
non-traditional mobile voice and data services or similar services continue to increase in popularity and if we, or
more generally all of the telecommunications operators, are not able to address this competition, this could cause
declines in subscriber base and profitability across all of our products and services, among other material adverse
effects.

In addition, we may face increasing competition from the large-scale roll-out of public WiFi networks by local
governments and utilities and transportation service providers, new and existing WiFi telecommunications
operators and others, which particularly benefits OTT service providers. Due to their ability to leverage the
existing infrastructure and to roll out public WiFi in a cost-efficient way, our competitors may be better positioned
to offer their customers public WiFi access at attractive terms and conditions or as part of their current mobile and
landline offerings, which may affect our ability to retain or acquire customers. Furthermore, our competitors may
realize cost savings by off-loading mobile data traffic onto their own WiFi networks or those of their partners in
order to reduce costs and increase bandwidth more quickly or efficiently than we can. An increase in public WiFi
networks could also cause declines in profitability as demand for our network and services decreases.


-----

The following is an overview of the competitive landscape in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic:

_Portugal_

In Portugal, we have experienced pressure from our competitors to reduce monthly subscription fees. The
competitive landscape has changed significantly as a result of the merger in 2013 of ZON Multimédia—Serviços
de Telecomunicações e Multimédia, SGPS, S.A. (“ZON”), the largest cable operator at that time, and Optimus
SGPS, S.A. (“Optimus”), the third largest mobile operator at that time, to create NOS SGPS, S.A. (“NOS”), an
integrated telecommunications operator in Portugal. We also face competition from Cabovisão (now Nowo),
which we disposed of in January 2016, under its new ownership. In the broadband and mobile market, we face
competition from Vodafone, NOS and Nowo, the latter operating through a MVNO with MEO. In the fixed
telephony market, PT Portugal has experienced, and may continue to experience, erosion of market share of both
access lines and of outgoing domestic and international traffic as result of the trend toward the use of mobile
services instead of fixed telephone services. Additionally, all mobile players have launched fixed telephony
services based on their mobile networks, which are directly competing for the same customers. Competition is
intensified by mobile operators NOS and Vodafone with large mobile operations, particularly in light of their
partnership relating to the reciprocal sharing of fiber and mobile towers across Portugal. The new network sharing
agreement between NOS and Vodafone took effect from the beginning of 2018 and contemplates the development
and sharing of dark fiber in fixed infrastructure at a national level. This agreement was subsequently extended to
the mobile infrastructure, covering mobile networks. These and such similar other developments could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Mobile operators can bypass
PT Portugal’s international wireline network by interconnecting directly with fixed-line and mobile networks
either in its domestic network or abroad. Through FastFiber, the Portuguese operation continues expanding its
proprietary fixed fiber infrastructure and rollout of FTTH, competing with Vodafone and NOS. In the business
services market, competitors such as Vodafone and NOS are taking market share from MEO in traditional
connectivity services, partly offset by MEO introducing new ICT services to its business customers. Competition
is also forcing down the prices of fixed-line voice services for long distance and international calls, as operators
have been offering unlimited voice communications for all national and several international fixed destinations.
Lowering international call prices has caused a decline in PT Portugal’s revenues from international fixed-line
voice services. We expect competition from operators with services based on VoIP to also place increasing price
pressure on voice tariffs. In addition, ANACOM (The Autoridade Nacional de Comunicações, the Portuguese
telecommunications regulator) has in recent years approved significant reductions in fixed and mobile termination
fees, as well as the prices charged by PT Portugal for leasing out its Continent-Azores-Madeira (“CAM”) lines
and ethernet circuits. These factors have significantly affected PT Portugal’s overall revenues, and we expect
these factors to continue to negatively affect revenues in the future.

_Israel_

In Israel, in the multi-channel television market, our main competitor is D.B.S. Satellite Services (1998) Ltd, a
subsidiary of Bezeq, which provides satellite technology based multi-channel television services under the brand
“YES”. Cellcom Israel Ltd. (“Cellcom”) and Partner Communications Company Ltd. (“Partner”) also provide
broadcasting offers to subscribers over the internet (OTT).

Other factors that have a material impact on competition in the market include the availability of free-to-air DTT
channels and the increasing availability of video content and services that may be offered via the internet. In
addition, we believe that the implementation of certain regulatory changes may have an impact on competition in
the market, including the expansion in the number of free-to-air DTT channels, the ‘narrow’ television package
and the increased scope of special broadcasting licenses pursuant to which we are required to broadcast television
channels owned by special broadcasting license holders on our network under certain terms.

In the broadband market, we compete primarily with Bezeq, which provides high speed broadband Internet access
over DSL, holds the highest market share in broadband Internet infrastructure access in Israel, and offers a range
of products with different download speeds, data transfer limits and other value added services. Continued
upgrades to the quality of Bezeq’s DSL based broadband internet infrastructure access service to VDSL and
potentially even faster DSL variants and the possibility of widespread FTTX installations which it launched in
March 2021, could have a negative impact on our competitive position in the broadband internet infrastructure
market and may also require us to revise our marketing strategy and make potentially significant capital
expenditures. The regulatory changes since 2015, requiring Bezeq and HOT to provide certain wholesale services
to service providers with a view to create a market for broadband infrastructure access and fixed telephony services,
has also resulted in increased competition from other service providers such as ISPs and IPTV providers who


-----

utilize our cable networks to provide internet services. These and such similar other regulatory changes may have
a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition had also increased
following the creation of a public-private joint venture in June 2013 between the government owned Israeli
Electric Company (“IEC”) and private owners which established IBC Israel, which use IEC’s passive physical
infrastructure in Israel to provide wholesale products to telecommunication services providers via an optical fiber
network, and thus competed with HOT and Bezeq in the wholesale market as well as providing such services
directly to large business customers. In June 2019, the Israeli Ministry of Communications approved a merger
between IBC Israel, and Cellcom and Israel Infrastructure Fund, further to approving a significant decrease in
IBC Israel’s deployment obligations. In February 2021, HOT acquired an indirect stake of approximately 23.3%
in IBC Israel, through its holdings in the partnership, similar to Cellcom and Israel Infrastructure Fund’s share
holding in IBC Israel. IEC continues to hold 30% of IBC Israel’s shares. As an integral part of the transaction,
HOT entered into an agreement for the purchase of indefeasible rights of use (IRU) in infrastructure lines in IBC
Israel, according to certain committed gradual increases in the percentage of the customers’ houses connected to
IBC Israel’s network. As of April 2021, HOT offers fiber-based internet services over IBC Israel’s fiber optic
network in certain areas where the network had already been deployed.

In addition to Cellcom and IBC Israel, Partner is also deploying an optical fiber based network in several areas.
In December 2018, the Israeli Ministry of Communications published a public hearing regarding the proposed
regulatory principles for the policy regarding the deployment of ultra broadband infrastructure in Israel in order
to create a competitive environment and establish rules that will promote the deployment of fiber optic networks
in Israel. Pursuant to the hearings and recommendations of a public committee appointed for this purpose, the
Israeli government approved the policy regarding fiber optic deployment in Israel in September 2020, followed
by an amendment to the Israeli Communication Law in December 2020. According to such policy, Bezeq is
required to notify to the Israeli Ministry of Communications of the areas in which it plans to deploy fiber and is
under an obligation to complete the deployment according to a timeline provided in its license. In order to also
promote the deployment of advanced network in peripheral areas, a national fund will be established to conduct
bid procedures for the deployment in such areas. The fund will be financed by all the telecommunication operators
(including Bezeq) which will be obligated to pay 0.5% of their respective annual income to the fund, with the
deduction of interconnect fees. Bezeq will not be entitled to participate in the bids.

Competition in providing fixed-line telephony service is intense and is expected to increase as a result of the
creation of the wholesale market with providers having introduced substantial price reductions over the past few
years. Bezeq, our principal competitor in the Israeli market and the largest provider of fixed-line telephony
services, has an extensive fixed-line telephone network throughout Israel, strong market knowledge, high brand
recognition and substantial capital resources. Other competitors provide fixed-line telephony services over
broadband (“VoB”), among them Cellcom and Partner.

In Israel, our mobile service, HOT Mobile, competes with several mobile network operators, including Cellcom,
Partner, Golan Telecom and Bezeq, who between them are estimated to directly represent approximately 95% of
the total market for mobile services in Israel as of March 31, 2021 by number of mobile customers. The telecom
market in Israel has changed significantly in recent years to become more fragmented, including nine players in
the mobile market, underlying an increase of competition. The principal mobile operators in Israel benefit from
strong brand recognition. In July 2019, the Israeli Ministry of Communications published a national bid for the
allocation of 5G frequencies. HOT Mobile and Partner submitted a joint proposal. Following the bid, each leading
mobile operator won certain frequency bands which allow them to provide 5G mobile cellular services. After the
completion of the allocation in September 2020, HOT launched 5G services in the first quarter of 2021 in certain
areas in Israel.

Competition in the provision of internet, data and voice products to business customers is intense, with Bezeq,
several local telephony operators through VoB and several international telephony operators among our
competitors. In addition to competitive activity, we continue to see challenges in this segment of the market as a
result of price erosion in existing products and the need to invest in new product development to satisfy the
evolving preferences of prospective customers.

_Dominican Republic_

We face significant competition from market incumbents, including Claro which has the largest market share in
each of the residential mobile, residential fixed and business services segments, and other small competitors. For
our fixed-based services, our competitors include local players such as Viva and Aster and also include, but are
not limited to, providers of television, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and business services using xDSL


-----

or fiber connections, providers of TV services using technologies such as IPTV and satellite, DTT providers,
mobile network operators providing fixed wireless broadband access services, providers of emerging digital
entertainment technologies, mobile voice and other providers of wholesale services. In the mobile market, Altice
Dominicana mainly competes with Claro (with which it shares a comparable spectrum range and 4G-LTE
population coverage), and with Viva in the low-end segment. We also face competition from other mobile
operators who own and operate a mobile network as well as from providers of VoIP. Altice Dominicana also
competes with niche players Wind and Sky. In the pay-TV segment, the market is still deeply fragmented with
several regional cable operators. For our wholesale services our key competitors include, but are not limited to,
wholesale providers of voice, data and fiber services.

The competitive landscape in the Dominican Republic is generally characterized by increasing competition, tiered
offerings that include lower priced entry-level products and in the fixed-line segment, a focus on multi-play
offerings, including special promotions and discounts for customers who subscribe for multi-play services. We
expect additional competitive pressure from media and telecommunications industries that seek to offer packages
of fixed-based and mobile voice, internet and video broadcast services. In addition, we expect competition to
increase as a result of changes to the regulatory regimes in the Dominican Republic, such as those attempting to
increase competition by allowing third party access to fixed networks that are considered an essential facility and
the obligation to share access to passive elements of mobile networks with other operators.

With respect to the Teads segment, we face competition from various market participants, including the Walled
Gardens such as Google and Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, Snap, Verizon, Iron Source, Xandr, Taboola, TripleLift,
supply side platforms and demand side platforms. As we grow larger, we may face increased competition from
the Walled Gardens should they choose to target our market share in the open internet as a growth opportunity. If
the Walled Gardens begin to compete more directly with us in this manner, it could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows. We also face competitive risks in our
relationship with publishers. Although we currently have exclusivity for outstream video with over 80% of
approximately 3,100 of our publishers, header bidding opportunities (whereby a publisher may offer ad space to
numerous outlets at once) may lead publishers to exit their exclusive arrangements with us. We also face
competition from alternative service providers who are able to compete directly with us on placements and who
can offer revenue guarantees that are competitive with ours. If our partnerships with publishers decline or become
non-exclusive, customers may choose to work with our competitors. Further, we may in the future face
competition from powerful publishers or alliances of publishers that compete directly with us by building their
own technology or using a competitive technology to sell outstream videos on their own or in combination with
one of our competitors.

Our inability to compete successfully against companies that offer services similar to ours could result in increased
customer churn, revenue loss, pressures on recruitment and retention of team members, service price reductions
and increased research and development, marketing and promotional expenses or reduced operating margins,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance, financial condition and cash
flows. Introduction of competent, competitive products, pricing strategies or other technologies by other
competitors that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services could
adversely affect our business.

**_The deployment of fiber optic networks and/or VDSL2 by our competitors could reduce and ultimately eliminate_**
**_the gap between the speed and the power of our fiber optic/cable network compared to the DSL networks of_**
**_our main competitors._**

We believe that one of our major competitive advantages is the power and speed of our fiber optic/cable network.
However, certain of our competitors are deploying and expanding their fiber and/or VDSL2 networks enabling
download speeds and bandwidths that could rival those reached by our network, and thus strongly reducing our
competitive advantage. Furthermore, other operators may obtain access to the infrastructure deployed by an
operator including certain of our fiber/cable networks, through joint projects or wholesale arrangements. For
instance, in Israel, IBC Israel operates on a wholesale model and several suppliers were already engaged with it,
including Cellcom, to provide fiber-based services using IBC Israel’s fiber optic network.

In general, Portugal is a mature market with respect to fiber deployment. As of March 31, 2021, the total number
of marketable homes in Portugal is approximately 7.2 million, with MEO’s proprietary homes passed at 4.7
million and Vodafone’s self-built homes at 3.4 million. NOS does not have significant proprietary fiber built,
however, it is expanding its footprint and its fiber cable passes 4.9 million homes. The fiber market in Israel is not
as mature and only Bezeq, IBC Israel and Partner are currently deploying fiber. With the total addressable homes


-----

being 2.5 million as of March 31, 2021, the homes passed for Bezeq is 1.5 million, for IBC Israel is 0.5 million
and for Partner is 0.75 million. Through IBC Israel, HOT is targeting to expand its fiber footprint to approximately
1.7 million households in Israel in the next five years and Bezeq has indicated that 250,000 homes (10% of the
total addressable homes in Israel) are ready to be connected, with the objective of reaching 1 million homes by
the end of 2021 (40% of total addressable homes). This pace of deployment is significantly higher than the
previous guidance consisting of reaching 50% of homes within four to five years. On March 14, 2021, Bezeq
launched its fiber commercial offering, following several years of negotiations with the regulators. This fiber
launch will potentially upsell a sizable chunk of its existing DSL subscribers thereby providing revenue tailwinds.
Bezeq faces competition from Cellcom and Partner, which jointly have approximately 10% market share for their
fiber offerings, with a large and growing addressable market.

Further, in the Dominican Republic, Empresa de Transmision Electrica Dominicana (“ETED Dominicana”) has
launched the National Fiber Optic Network Backbone, a project pursuant to which its transmission facilities
connecting multiple electrical nodes creates a reliable optic transport. ETED Dominicana has also installed a
cabinet where local operators can perform a local loop connection to serve their customers or branches. Currently
the coverage is in certain provinces, including the Gran Santo Domingo area, Santiago, San Pedro de Macoris and
San Cristobal. ETED Dominicana provides connectivity for certain governmental agencies (including the police
and national electricity companies). Pursuant to a permit concession granted by Indotel, ETED Dominicana may
sell its services to local operators only, such as Claro, Altice Dominicana, Wind or local cable operators, and may
no longer offer its services to end customers. This could result in increasing price pressure on our operations in
the Dominican Republic.

If our competitors continue to deploy or significantly increase their access to fiber optic networks they could
compete with us in terms of the offering of high-speed internet and television services of a quality and speed
greater than or equal to ours, thus potentially eliminating our current competitive advantage, increasing the
pressure upon prices and margins and leading us to make significant investments in order to match the services
they offer. The deployment of VDSL2 and/or access to fiber optic networks by competitors also represents a risk
for the business services segment of the Group, particularly with regard to medium-sized, small-to-medium-sized
and very-small-sized businesses to which the Group’s DSL and fiber/cable networks presently represent an
advantage. Although we are preparing for this deployment by improving our product range and building our
fiber/cable network, such deployment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and
results of operations.

**_With respect to our Teads segment, advertisers may choose to shift more spend to Walled Gardens as third-_**
**_party cookies are deprecated among independent publishers operating outside the Walled Gardens._**

In the last several of years, internet browsers have started deprecating third-party cookies, which are small text
files created and placed by third-party technology websites (like Teads) other than the website a user is visiting.
These cookies are used to track a user for targeting purposes and measure performance of digital advertising
campaigns without collecting nor processing personally identifiable information. This shift by internet browsers
stems from pressure from consumers and regulators to ensure the industry is respecting user privacy as some
consumers and regulators deemed cookies to be impacting consumer privacy. This decline in the use of thirdparty cookies limits advertising technology companies’ ability to track and target users, potentially resulting in
advertising campaigns being less effective. Though we have developed our own cookie-less alternatives, there is
no guarantee that advertisers will find our alternative solutions to be effective, and the perception that our or other
solutions are not effective may cause advertisers to shift more spend away from the open internet and towards
Walled Gardens such as Facebook and Google, which do not rely as much on cookies and are able to use loggedin user data for targeting and tracking purposes.

Further, with respect to the Teads segment, the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a
number of factors, including price competition, our ability to accurately estimate revenues from customer
engagements, our ability to estimate resources and other costs for long-term pricing and cash flows for long-term
contracts, our customers’ perceptions of our ability to add value through our services, introduction of new services
or products by us or our competitors and general economic and political conditions. In addition, privacy
regulations may further restrict customers’ ability to run targeted advertising campaigns, which will lead to pricing
decline since customers will want to pay less for less targeted advertising.

**_Changes in competitive offerings for content, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video_**
**_offerings, could adversely impact our business._**

The market for content is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution
channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video, sports and other content. The various
economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based
models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the content market. The ability of
customers to obtain high quality content may lead to a decline in our pay television business. Traditional providers
of content, including broadcasters, as well as internet based e-commerce or content providers are increasing their
internet-based offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong
brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from
suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology,
infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market, or existing providers may
adjust their services, with unique offerings or approaches to providing content. Companies also may enter into
business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Piracy, in particular, threatens to
damage our business, as its fundamental proposition of virtually all content being offered for free to consumers is
so compelling and difficult to compete against. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition,
piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with
current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or
maintain market share, revenues or profitability.

**_With respect to our Teads segment, our failure to maintain and grow our relationships with customers and_**
**_publishers and increase spend through the Teads platform may negatively impact the Teads revenue and_**
**_business._**

To sustain or increase our revenue from the Teads segment, we must regularly add new customers (agencies and
advertisers) and encourage existing customers to maintain or increase the amount of advertising spend placed
through the Teads platform. If competitors introduce lower cost or differentiated offerings that compete with or
are perceived to compete with Teads’, our ability to grow the Teads business with new or existing customers could
be impaired. It is possible that we may reach a point of saturation from which we cannot continue to grow our
revenue because of internal limits that advertisers may place on the allocation of their advertising budgets for
digital media to a particular provider or otherwise. Teads customers typically have relationships with different
providers and there is limited cost to moving budgets to Teads’ competitors. As a result, we may have limited
visibility as to our future revenue streams. We cannot assure you that Teads customers will continue to use our
platform or that we will be able to replace, in a timely or effective manner, departing customers with new
customers and publishers that generate comparable revenue.

On the supply side, Teads is subject to the economic health and evolving business strategies of its publisher
partners. Teads depends upon publishers to provide advertising space which it can offer to existing and prospective
advertisers and agencies. While Teads has established exclusivity for outstream video with 80% of approximately
3,100 of our publisher partners, and has experienced a Publisher Retention Rate (defined as the number of our top
500 publishers retained from the prior period end) of approximately 99% in the year ended December 31, 2020, a
decline in exclusivity levels or retention rates could have a material adverse effect on its ability to grow its
revenues and execute its strategy. If Teads fails to provide sufficient advertising demand and expected levels of
monetization, its publisher partners may consider renegotiating the terms of their contractual exclusivity or
establishing relationships with our competitors. Furthermore, independent publishers struggle to compete with the
Walled Gardens, which has driven some publishers out of business. When independent publishers go out of
business, Teads experiences a decrease in access to premium advertising inventory, which may make its services
less attractive to agencies and advertisers. Publishers may also opt to transition to a subscription model as an
alternative method of providing their content, which would not include advertisements, which would also
contribute to a decrease in our access to premium inventory. A decline in the market for programmatic advertising
or the failure of that market to grow as expected could also adversely affect the business, results of operations and
financial condition of Teads. Any of these developments may adversely affect the business, results of operations
and financial health of Teads.

**_The current macroeconomic environment is highly volatile, and continuing instability in global markets may_**
**_jeopardize our growth targets, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results_**
**_of operations and significantly increase our cost of debt._**

Our operations are subject to macroeconomic and political risks that are outside of our control. The current
macroeconomic environment is highly volatile, and continuing instability in global markets, including instability
related to the COVID-19 pandemic, international trade, tariffs, sovereign debt issues, the risk of inflation and
deflation and the stability of the euro, has contributed to a challenging global economic environment. High levels
of sovereign debt in the U.S. and certain European countries combined with weak growth and high unemployment
could lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), sovereign debt restructurings, currency instability,
increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and, potentially, disruptions in the credit and equity
markets as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our business and financial operations. In Europe,
future developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness
of measures by the EU Commission to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe and the overall stability
of the Eurozone.

As the countries in which we operate seek to recover from any natural disasters and pandemics (such as the
COVID-19 pandemic) or their governments seek new sources of revenue due to high fiscal deficit, such
governments may impose new or increased taxes and levies. Accordingly, our results of operations and cash flows
may be adversely affected if the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain or declines further or the
government increases taxes or levies as a result of fiscal deficits, pandemics or natural disasters. We are currently
unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects.

Furthermore, we rely on third-party vendors for the equipment (including customer premises equipment,
telecommunications equipment, network infrastructure and mobile handsets), software and services that we
require in order to provide services to our customers. Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their
ability to meet our needs is subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, international
regulations or sanctions, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems or power supplies, terrorism,
pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and labor issues.

With regard to currency instability issues, concerns exist in the Eurozone with respect to individual macro
fundamentals on a country-by-country basis, as well as with respect to the overall stability of the European
monetary union and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific fiscal management and
sovereign debt issues in individual Eurozone countries. Following the U.K.’s exit from the EU on January 31,
2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), the U.K. entered into a transition period which terminated on December
31, 2020, before which on December 24, 2020, the U.K. and the EU agreed to a trade deal (the “Trade and
**Cooperation Agreement”) which was ratified by the U.K. on December 30, 2020. The Trade and Cooperation**
Agreement had been applied provisionally since January 1, 2021 subject to formal approval by the European
Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The European Parliament approved it on April 28, 2021 and
the Trade and Cooperation Agreement is now effective. While it is difficult to predict the effect of Brexit on the
European and global economy, uncertainty regarding new or modified arrangements between the U.K. and the
EU could result in additional volatility in the markets, increased costs and a material adverse effect on the buying
behavior of commercial and individual customers. Brexit has created substantial political uncertainty within the
EU, uncertainty in international financial markets and reduced economic growth in certain jurisdictions. It is
possible that members of the European monetary union could hold similar referendums regarding their
membership within the Eurozone in the future. The realization of these concerns could lead to the exit of one or
more countries from the European monetary union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these
countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely, which could result in
the redenomination of a portion or, in the extreme case, all of the Group’s euro-denominated assets, liabilities and
cash flows to the new currency of the country in which they originated. This could result in a mismatch in the
currencies of the Group’s assets, liabilities and cash flows. Any such mismatch, together with the capital market
disruption that would likely accompany any such redenomination event, could have a material adverse impact on
the Group’s liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination event would likely be
accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the Eurozone countries, which in turn could
have an adverse impact on demand for our products and, accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows.

Further, since we rely on access to the financial markets in order to refinance our debt liabilities and gain access
to new financing, ongoing political uncertainty and any worsening of the economic environment may reduce our
ability to refinance our existing and future liabilities or gain access to new financing, in each case on favorable


-----

terms or at all. Furthermore, our counterparties may not be able to fulfil their obligations under their respective
agreements due to a lack of liquidity, operational failure, bankruptcy or other reasons.

Moreover, any changes from euro to non-euro currencies in countries in which we operate would require us to
modify our billing and other financial systems. No assurance can be given that any required modifications could
be made within a timeframe that would allow us to timely bill our customers or prepare and file required financial
reports. In light of the significant exposure that we have to the euro through our euro-denominated borrowings,
derivative instruments, cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination event could have a material adverse impact
on our business.

Furthermore, continued hostilities in the Middle East and North Africa could adversely affect the Israeli economy.
Additionally, the economy of the Dominican Republic depends to a significant degree on global tourism and the
health of the U.S. economy and remains vulnerable to external shocks (e.g. economic declines in other emerging
market countries). Any decrease in visitors, downturns in the U.S. economy or other similar external shocks could
have a material adverse effect on economic growth in the Dominican Republic. Environmental factors, such as
disruptions due to natural disasters, have in the past and may in the future have an adverse effect on the economies
of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the Dominican Republic. Negative macroeconomic and
political conditions could also adversely affect access to capital and increase the cost of capital. As a result of
disruptions in the credit markets, many lenders may increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, require
more restrictive terms (including higher collateral ratios for advances, shorter maturities and smaller loan amounts)
or refuse to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to pre-crisis conditions. Changes in interest rates and
exchange rates may also adversely affect the fair value of our assets and liabilities. If there is a negative impact
on the fair values of our assets and liabilities, we could be required to record impairment charges.

Negative macroeconomic developments in the markets in which we operate, in particular increasing levels of
unemployment, may have a direct negative impact on the spending patterns of retail consumers, both in terms of
the products they subscribe for and usage levels. Because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from
residential subscribers who may be impacted by these conditions, it may be more difficult to attract new
subscribers and more likely that certain of our subscribers will downgrade or disconnect their services. In addition,
we can provide no assurances that a deterioration of any of these economies will not lead to a higher number of
non-paying customers or generally result in service disconnections. Similarly, a deterioration in economic
conditions would be likely to adversely affect the demand for, and pricing of, our business services as a result of
businesses and governments reducing spending. Therefore, a weak economy and negative economic development
in the markets in which we operate may jeopardize our growth targets and may have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, adverse economic conditions (including as
a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) may lead to a rise in the number of our customers who are not able to pay
for our services.

Each of the above-mentioned risks has been heightened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world
economy.

**_Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19_**
**_pandemic._**

The COVID-19 pandemic, and measures to prevent its spread, may have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. The severity and timing of the impact will depend on a number of
factors, including the level and rapidity of infection, the speed and efficacy of national and global vaccination
programs, duration of the pandemic and related containment measures, changes in consumer spending patterns,
measures imposed or taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, macroeconomic conditions
in our markets, and negative effects on the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and vendors.

Under difficult economic conditions, including prolonged unemployment and employment furloughs, demand for
our products and services could decline and some customers may be unable or unwilling to pay for our products
and services. Additionally, in order to prioritize the demands of the business and/or depending on any restrictions
that may be imposed by the governments in various jurisdictions on deployment of new infrastructure, we may,
or may be required to, delay certain capital investments, such as fibre deployment or in other new initiatives,
products or services, which may adversely affect our business in the future. If these events occur and were to
continue, our revenue may be reduced materially which could result in reduced operating margins and a reduction
in cash flows. While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a limited impact on our financial results for the year ended


-----

December 31, 2020 and for the three months ended March 31, 2021, we have been impacted by a decline in
handset sales in the context of the closure of shops and a decrease in roaming revenue due to decreased travel.

Governmental and non-governmental initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition
of restrictions on work and public gatherings and the promotion of social distancing, along with certain temporary
regulations concerning collections, or changes in consumer behaviour, have impacted and could continue to
impact our operations and financial results. Even though the strict lockdown conditions are being lifted in certain
jurisdictions, significant restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place, which continue to adversely
affect the overall world economy and, in turn, our operations. If a significant portion of our workforce is unable
to work effectively due to prolonged illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions,
facility closures or other reasons in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations could be further
materially impacted. Our suppliers and vendors also may be affected by such measures in their ability to provide
products and services to us and these measures could also make it more difficult for us to serve our customers.
The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and there is a significant risk of recurring outbreaks in affected countries
and possible future mutations in the virus may prove difficult to contain. For example, many countries in Europe
have re-introduced full or partial lockdowns in late 2020 and 2021 in order to stem subsequent waves of higher
infection rates. It is unclear whether measures being taken by governments across various jurisdictions to contain
the COVID-19 pandemic are adequate and will be effective in achieving their goals. It is unclear when, if at all,
the COVID-19 pandemic will be contained.

We have implemented enhanced health and safety measures in our operations in line with public health rules and
guidelines and industry practices to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the increase in
costs associated with the implementation of such measures, we are also exposed to the risk of an increase in the
number of workplace and third-party claims arising from actual or alleged failures to implement such measures
adequately, or at all, and a potential increase in legal, advisory and other costs as a result of any COVID-19
pandemic related claims from workers or third party customers and suppliers that may come into contact with our
operations.

During the course of the pandemic, financial markets have been experiencing extreme fluctuations. Any similar
fluctuations may cause a contraction in available liquidity globally as important segments of the markets react to
the development. The pandemic may lead to a decline in business and consumer confidence and presents the risk
of an economic recession around the globe, which could adversely impact our results.

Further, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by the EU institutions, other countries
in the EU and other geographies where we operate could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the
future, including a destabilization of the EU or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of European integration.
In addition, the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, financial condition and results of
operations could exacerbate the other risks identified in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Disruptions in the credit and equity markets could increase the risk of default by the counterparties to our_**
**_financial instruments, undrawn debt facilities and cash investments and may impact our future financial_**
**_position._**

Although we seek to manage the credit risks associated with our financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents
and undrawn debt facilities, disruptions in credit and equity markets could increase the risk that our counterparties
could default on their obligations to us. Were one or more of our counterparties to fail or otherwise be unable to
meet its obligations to us, our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
It is not possible to predict how disruptions in the credit and equity markets and the associated difficult economic
conditions could impact our future financial position. In this regard, (i) the financial failures of any of our
counterparties could (a) reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities and (b) adversely impact our
ability to access cash deposited with any failed financial institution and (ii) sustained or further tightening of the
credit markets could adversely impact our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all.

**_Changes in financial accounting standards may cause unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported_**
**_results of operations._**

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are
considered by our management to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time. These estimates and


-----

assumptions form the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
available from other sources. Areas requiring more complex judgments may shift over time based on changes in
the business mix and industry practice which could affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and
expenses. In addition, management’s judgments, estimates and assumptions and the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses may be affected by changes in accounting policy.

For instance, in January 2016, the International Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard (IFRS 16
(Leases)) which came into effect on January 1, 2019, superseding the previous standard (IAS 17) and its
interpretations. The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method, with the date of initial
application of January 1, 2019. IFRS 16 had a significant impact on our consolidated statement of financial
position from periods beginning on January 1, 2019, due to the recognition of right-of-use (“ROU”) related to
leased assets and corresponding lease liabilities. Moreover, our consolidated statement of profit or loss is impacted
as operating lease fees corresponding to such ROU assets no longer comprise a part of operating expenses, but
instead are recognized under depreciation and interest expenses. Our consolidated statement of cash flows is also
impacted given that payment for lease liabilities is now presented within financing activities. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Group—Basis of Presentation”_
for more information. For further details on new accounting standards that may have a significant impact on our
consolidated financial statements, see, Note 1.3 to the 2019 Financial Statements, Note 1.3 to the 2020 Financial
Statements and Note 2.1.1.1 to the Unaudited Financial Statements, included in this Offering Memorandum.

**_The liquidity and value of our interests in certain of our subsidiaries and our ability to take certain corporate_**
**_actions may be adversely affected by shareholder agreements and other similar agreements to which we are a_**
**_party._**

Certain of our operations are conducted through subsidiaries or associates in which third parties hold a minority
equity interest or with respect to which we have provided third parties with rights to acquire minority equity
interests in the future. Our equity interests in such subsidiaries are subject to shareholder agreements, partnership
agreements and other instruments and agreements that contain provisions that affect the liquidity, and therefore
the realizable value, of those interests. Most of these agreements subject the transfer of equity interests to consent
rights, pre-emption rights or rights of first refusal of the other shareholders or partners. All of these provisions
will restrict the ability to sell those equity interests and may adversely affect the prices at which those interests
may be sold. In addition, the present or potential future shareholders in our subsidiaries have the ability to block
certain transactions or decisions that we would otherwise undertake.

Although the terms of our investments vary, our operations may be affected if disagreements develop with other
equity participants in the Group’s subsidiaries. Failure to resolve such disputes could have an adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may have exposure to greater than expected tax liabilities._**

The tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may be subject to change and there may be
changes in the content as well as in the interpretation and enforcement of tax law. As a result, we may face
increases in taxes payable if tax rates increase, or if tax laws and regulations are modified by the competent
authorities in an adverse manner. In addition, the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate
periodically examine our activities. Any change in local or international tax rules, for example prompted by the
implementation of the OECD’s recommendations on Base Erosion and Profits Shifting (a global initiative to
improve the fairness and integrity of tax systems), or new challenges by tax authorities, may have an adverse
effect on our tax status and our financial results. Any changes may also affect the return on an investors’
investment in the Group and result in changes in personal tax rates and tax relief.

We have structured our commercial and financial activities in compliance with various regulatory obligations to
which we are subject, as well as in line with our commercial and financial objectives. Significant judgment is
required in determining the Group’s tax positions, including, amongst others, corporate income tax and value
added tax (VAT). In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination
is uncertain. To the extent that the laws and regulations of the various countries in which our companies are located
or operate do not establish clear or definitive positions, the tax treatment applied to our activities or our intragroup reorganizations is sometimes based on interpretations of the applicable tax regulations. We cannot guarantee
that our interpretations will not be called into question by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we
operate, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of our operations. More


-----

generally, any breach of the tax regulations and laws of the countries in which our companies are located or
operate could result in adjustments or the payment of late fees, fines or penalties.

In addition, tax laws and regulations could change and could be subjected to changes in their interpretation and in
the application thereof. In particular, in the current macroeconomic environment, governmental authorities could
decide to increase tax rates, to eliminate existing tax exemptions, to expand tax bases, or to introduce new taxes.
As a result, we could undergo an increase in our tax burden if tax rates rise or if legislation or the interpretation
thereof by the administration changes.

**_The Group might not be able to effectively implement or adapt its business strategy._**

The Group has based its strategy on its vision of the market, especially the importance of very-high-speed
fiber/cable and mobile networks and of fixed-mobile convergence. At the core of the Group’s strategy is customer,
revenue, profitability and cash flow growth by efficiently running telecom assets, creating underlying organic
growth, and as a result, achieving a leverage profile consistent with the stated target leverage range. Key elements
of this strategy include: (i) building operational and financial turnaround in Portugal; (ii) optimizing the
performance in each market with a particular focus on customer services; (iii) continuing to invest in best-in-class
infrastructure commensurate with our market position; (iv) growing advertising revenue; and (v) the potential
monetization of part of the Group companies’ infrastructure and assets at attractive valuations. However, the
Group is evolving in a market affected by economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainty and it must regularly
adapt its business model to take into account market changes such as changes in consumer behavior, introduction
of new technology, products or services, competition and the development of specific pricing policies, the
adaptation of its structural costs, the streamlining of its operational organization, and the adaptation of its sales
strategy. If the measures taken by the Group do not meet the demands, expectations, or habits of the consumer, it
will have an adverse effect on the return on investments, financial targets, market share, and revenues generated.
Consequently, any development of the Group’s business strategy that proves not to be sufficiently adapted to the
actual trends and demands, expectations, or habits of the consumer in the telecommunications market may not
achieve its desired goals and/or have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position and results of
operations.

Moreover, the transformation of the Group following the execution of certain strategic transactions, including
non-core asset disposals, strategic acquisitions and investments or entry into joint venture arrangements, could
create operational difficulties and unforeseen expenses and could give rise to significant administrative, financial,
and managerial challenges involving the activity of the Group. Such strategic transactions may also disrupt our
ongoing business, cause management’s attention to be diverted and result in legal, regulatory, contractual, labor,
or other difficulties that have not been foreseen or disclosed.

Historically, our business has grown, in part, through a significant number of acquisitions. We may continue to
grow our business through selective acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses that we believe will present
opportunities to create value by generating strong cash flows and operational synergies. The success of this
strategy of pursuing strategic opportunities through selective acquisitions or other combinations depends on our
ability to identify the appropriate targets, audit such targets appropriately, negotiate favorable terms, and carry out
these transactions and integrate the new acquisitions. We may experience difficulties in integrating acquired
operations into our business, incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits or
synergies of these acquisitions, if any. Such transactions may also disrupt our relationships with current and new
employees, customers and suppliers. In addition, our management may be distracted by such acquisitions and the
integration of acquired businesses. Such transactions may also be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing
conditions or require the approval of governmental authorities (either domestically or, in the case of the EU, at
the EU level), which can block, impose conditions on, or delay the process. The failure to satisfy such conditions
or obtain such approvals could result in a failure on our part to proceed with announced transactions on a timely
basis or at all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In addition, future consolidations in the sectors where
we operate will reduce opportunities for acquisitions or combinations. We believe that some of our competitors
are implementing similar acquisition strategies and these competitors may have greater financial resources to
make investments or may be able to accept less favorable terms than us, thus depriving us of opportunities and
reducing the number of potential acquisition targets. The implementation of our acquisition strategy could increase
the level of indebtedness of the Group, which could create new or intensify existing risks faced by the Group. See
“—Risks Relating to our Financial Profile”. Furthermore, our ability to make acquisitions is limited by our
financing agreements. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”.


-----

We periodically evaluate, and have engaged in, strategic transactions, such as the sale of international wholesale
assets, the Towers Transactions and the Altice Portugal FTTH Transaction. Divestitures could involve difficulties
in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management’s attention, the
disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for
the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well
as to obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent
us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested
assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested
assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. Any divestiture undertaken by us could adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations. In certain cases, the Group has entered into joint venture
arrangements with a majority or minority interest in such joint ventures. Even in cases where the Group retained
a majority interest, our joint venture partner may have significant influence over policies, including dividend
policy and consent rights with respect to certain specified matters. The Group has a lesser degree of control over
the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which it has made minority investments.

**_Revenue from certain of our services has been declining, or not growing, and we may be unable to offset such_**
**_trends._**

We have experienced declines in our consolidated revenues and the revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated
from certain of our operating segments and operating activities. We may continue to experience further declines,
which we may not be able to offset with the introduction of new services, depending on technological trends,
customer consumption patterns and competitive behavior in the market. Our total revenues decreased for the year
ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31 2019 and there was a decrease in revenues
in the residential mobile and residential equipment segments. Similarly, our total revenue decreased for the year
ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 and there was a decrease in revenues
in the residential fixed, residential mobile, business services and media segments. On a consolidated basis, for the
year ended December 31, 2020, and the three months ended March 31, 2021, we generated revenue of €4,065
million and €1,015 million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of €1,580 million and €371 million, respectively,
compared to revenue of €4,084 million and €991 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of €1,548 million and €375
million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and three months ended March 31, 2020, respectively. On a
consolidated basis, for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the three months ended March 31, 2021, we
generated profit from continuing operations of €418 million and loss from continuing operations of €159 million,
respectively, compared to loss from continuing operations of €439 million and profit from continuing operations
of €704 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and three months ended March 31, 2020, respectively. For
a reconciliation of the Group’s profit/(loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA, see “Summary
_Financial Information and Other Data—Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA—Reconciliation of profit/(loss) from_
_continuing operations and operating profit/(loss) to Adjusted EBITDA”. For a detailed break-down of revenue per_
operating activity for each of the periods presented in the table above, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Discussion and Analysis of Our Results of Operations—For_
_the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020—Revenue”,_
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Discussion and
_Analysis of Our Results of Operations—For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended_
_December 31, 2019—Revenue” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results_
_of Operations—Discussion and Analysis of Our Results of Operations—For the year ended December 31, 2019_
_compared to the year ended December 31, 2018—Revenue”._

Altice Dominicana’s revenues decreased in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019 and in the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March
31, 2020. The decrease in reported revenue was mainly driven by the unfavorable development of the foreign
currency rate for DOP. On a local currency basis, the revenue of Altice Dominicana increased by 5.1% during
this period. Adjusted EBITDA from Israel and the Dominican Republic decreased for the year ended December
31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA from each of Portugal, Israel and
the Dominican Republic decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December
31, 2018 and in the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, due
to an increase in the operating costs and staff costs and employee benefit expenses while Group revenue increased.

We anticipate that the trend of declining revenues and Adjusted EBITDA in certain operating segments and
operating activities may continue and there can be no assurance that the initiatives that we undertake to offset
revenue and Adjusted EBITDA declines in certain activities will materialize. Our business, financial conditions


-----

and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to introduce new, or enhance existing,
products and services or implement cost-saving or revenue enhancing strategies.

**_We have a history of losses and may report losses in the future._**

We have reported loss from continuing operations of €439 million for year ended December 31, 2019 compared
to profit from continuing operations of €418 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the three months
ended March 31, 2021, we reported loss from continuing operations of €159 million, compared to profit from
continuing operations of €704 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. We may incur losses in the
future due to, among other things, interest expenses, depreciation and capital expenditure. While a portion of any
future losses may consist of depreciation and amortization expenses, which do not directly impact our cash flow,
future losses may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and may limit our
ability to engage in equity or debt financings.

**_The political and military conditions in Israel may adversely affect our financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

Our operations in Israel are affected by political and military conditions. Since the establishment of the State of
Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries. For
instance, in April 2021 the conflict between Israel and Hamas escalated significantly before both sides entered
into a ceasefire on May 21, 2021. There is no assurance that the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas will continue
and that no further conflicts will arise. Hostilities involving Israel, any interruption or curtailment of trade between
Israel and its trading partners and political instability within Israel or its neighboring countries are likely to have
an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, in recent conflicts,
missile attacks have occurred on civilian areas, which could cause substantial damage to our networks, affecting
our overall network capacity and reducing our ability to continue serving our customers. In addition, in the event
that recent political unrest and instability in the Middle East, including changes in some of the governments in the
region, cause investor concern resulting in a reduction in the value of NIS, our expenses in non-Shekel currencies
may increase, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

During an emergency, including a major communications crisis in Israel’s national communications network, a
natural disaster, or a special security situation in Israel, control of our networks may be assumed by a lawfully
authorized person in order to protect the security of the State of Israel or to ensure the provision of necessary
services to the public. During such circumstances, the government also has the right to temporarily withdraw some
of the mobile spectrum granted to us. Under the Equipment Registration and Mobilization to the Israel Defense
Forces Law, 1987, the Israel Defense Forces may mobilize our engineering equipment for their use, compensating
us for such use and any consequent damage. This may materially harm our ability to provide services to our
subscribers in such emergency circumstances and have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations.

Moreover, the Prime Minister of Israel may, under powers which the Communications Law (Telecommunication
and Broadcasting), 5742—1982 (the “Communications Law”) grants him for reasons of state security or public
welfare, order us to provide services to the security forces to perform telecommunications activities and to set up
telecommunications facilities required by the security forces to carry out their duties.

Some of our officers and employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty. All reservists are
subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances. In addition, some of our
employees may be forced to stay at home during emergency circumstances in their area. We cannot assess the full
impact of these requirements on our workforce and business if such circumstances arise.

More generally, any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability in the region would likely negatively
affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations, including following the cessation of such
conflicts, due to a potential decrease in the number of tourists visiting Israel. Several countries in the region, in
particular Syria, have been experiencing increased political instability and armed conflict, which have led to
changes in the governments of some of these countries, the effects of which are currently difficult to assess.
Further, tensions have increased recently as a result of the nuclear deal between Iran and the United States and
following Russia’s involvement in the Syrian war.


-----

**_Terrorist attacks and threats as well as the escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of_**
**_war may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Our business is affected by general economic conditions, fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending and
market liquidity which can decline as a result of numerous factors outside of our control, such as terrorist attacks
and acts of war. In Israel, the ongoing hostilities with the Palestinians, future terrorist attacks, rumors or threats
of war, actual conflicts in which Israel or its allies might be involved, or military or trade disruptions affecting us
or our customers may adversely affect our operations.

**_Our growth prospects depend on continued demand for fixed-based and mobile products and services and_**
**_increased demand for bundled and premium offerings._**

The use of Internet, television and fixed-line telephony and mobile services in certain of the jurisdictions in which
we operate has increased sharply in recent years. We have benefited from this growth in recent years and our
growth and profitability depend, in part, on continued demand for these services in the coming years. We rely on
our multi-play and premium television services in most of the jurisdictions in which we operate to attract new
customers and to migrate existing customers to such services. Therefore, if demand for multi-play products and
premium television services does not increase as expected, this could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our business is capital-intensive and our capital expenditures may not generate a positive return or we may be_**
**_unable or unwilling to make additional capital expenditures._**

Our business demands significant capital expenditures to add customers to our networks, including expenditures
relating to equipment and labor. In particular, we incur and expect to continue to incur significant capital expenses
for the deployment of new technologies such as 4G and 5G (for the purchase of frequencies and the deployment
of network infrastructures) for our mobile operations and fiber optics (for the deployment of the fiber
infrastructure) for our fixed operations. Moreover, as spectrum auctions are infrequent and we may need additional
spectrum in the future, we will likely participate in future spectrum auctions even though we might not, at the
time of auction, require additional spectrum capacity. Such participation would require significant capital
expenditures in the near term as acquiring spectrum is expensive, due in part to the fact that spectrum availability
is limited. For example, in Portugal, ANACOM recently approved regulation for rights of use of frequencies to
be allocated in the 700 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2.1 GHz bands, 2.6 GHz and 3.6 GHz, in which context only
a limited number of rights of use shall be attributed. Furthermore, in July 2019, the Israeli Ministry of
Communications published a tender for 5G frequencies, and HOT submitted a joint proposal with Partner and
each service provider won the following frequency bids: 10 MHz in the 700 MHz frequency range, 20 MHz in
the 2,600 MHz frequency range and 50 MHz in the 3,500 MHz frequency range. Following the completion of the
allocation in September 2020, HOT started offering 5G services in the first quarter of 2021 in certain areas in
Israel. Further, in Portugal, the 5G spectrum auction started on December 22, 2020 and the allocation of rights of
use for frequencies is expected in the third quarter of 2021. In the Dominican Republic, the 5G spectrum auction
started on February 9, 2021 and the expected allocation of rights of use for frequencies is scheduled for the fourth
quarter of 2021. We expect to participate in both of these auctions.

Furthermore, new technologies and the use of multiple applications increasing customers’ bandwidth
requirements could lead to saturation of the networks and require telecommunications operators to make
additional investments to increase their infrastructure capacity. Moreover, we regularly invest in the content that
we offer in order to provide our subscribers with a flexible and diverse range of programming and other content
options, including high-quality local content and exclusive premium content, in order to reduce churn. We intend
to continue to selectively invest in local and value-added premium content as well as sports broadcasting and
distribution rights in the future in order to enrich our differentiated and convergent communication services from
those of our competitors. Such investments are capital-intensive and no assurance can be given that our recent or
future capital expenditures will decrease churn, increase ARPU, generate a positive return or that we will have
adequate capital available to finance future upgrades or acquire additional content, programming or licenses. If
we are unable to, or elect not to, pay for costs associated with adding new customers, expanding or upgrading our
networks, or making our other planned or unplanned capital expenditures, our growth and competitive position
may be materially adversely affected.

We are also bound by certain obligations of access and/or coverage for our fiber/cable and/or mobile network,
such as obligations to allow roaming or sharing of networks in certain deployment zones. This requires us to make
significant and frequent investments and the conditions for the implementation of these obligations, including


-----

some prices (such as roaming rates), may be regulated. Given such constraints, we may not be able to operate our
network under economically favorable conditions, which could affect the profitability of our investments. We
may be subject to similar obligations in the future, which could have a material effect on the manner in which we
operate its business and, accordingly, on our outlook, financial position or results of operations.

It cannot be guaranteed that we will continue to have sufficient resources to maintain the quality of our network
and of our other products and services, and to expand our network coverage, which are key elements for our
growth of over the long term. Unforeseen investment expenses, an inability to finance them at an acceptable cost
or even an inability to make profitable investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, outlook,
financial position or results of operations.

**_We are subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risks which may adversely affect our earnings._**

While we generally attempt to increase our subscription rates to offset increases in operating costs, there is no
assurance that we will be able to do so due to competitive and other factors. Therefore, operating costs may rise
faster than associated revenue, resulting in a material negative impact on our cash flow and results of operations.
We are also affected by inflationary increases in salaries, wages, benefits and other administrative costs which we
may not be in a position to pass on to our customers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our long-lived assets may become impaired in the future, which could cause a non-cash charge to our earnings._**

The valuations of certain of our assets in connection with acquisitions has resulted in increases to the book value
of long lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Amortizable long-lived assets
must be reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Non-amortizable long-lived assets are
required to be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever indicators of impairment
exist. Indicators of impairment could include, but are not limited to:

- an inability to perform at levels that were forecasted;

- a permanent decline in market capitalization;

- an implementation of restructuring plans;

- changes in industry trends; and/or

- unfavorable changes in our capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates or capital expenditure levels.

Situations such as these could result in an impairment that would require a material non-cash charge, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_A significant amount of our book value consists of intangible assets that may not generate cash in the event of_**
**_a voluntary or involuntary sale._**

As of March 31, 2021, we reported €13,833 million of consolidated total assets, of which €1,102 million were
intangible (excluding goodwill) and €3,175 million was goodwill. Intangible assets primarily include customer
relationships, trade names, franchises and patents, software and licenses and other amortizable intangibles. While
we believe that the carrying values of our intangible assets are recoverable, you should not assume that we would
receive any cash from the voluntary or involuntary sale of these intangible assets, particularly if we were not
continuing as an operating business. Moreover, we may be required in the future to record additional charges to
earnings if a portion of our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. Factors that could lead to impairment
of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate, a deterioration in
our performance or a decline in expected future cash flows. Any such charges would adversely impact our
financial results.

**_Our business is subject to risks of earthquakes, hurricanes, fire, power outages, floods, and other catastrophic_**
**_events that can be further intensified due to the developing threat of climate change._**

Our networks and operations may be subject to interruptions by natural disasters, including, but not limited to
hurricanes, fire, floods, earthquakes and other events beyond our control. As we operate in certain jurisdictions in


-----

which existing infrastructure and telecommunications equipment (such as cables and mobile towers) may not be
able to withstand a major natural disaster and/or in which emergency response time may be significant, prolonged
recovery time could be required to resume operations. Moreover, certain countries and territories in which we
operate are exposed to the developing threat of climate change and they may be affected by the environmental
impact thereof, such as rising sea and air temperatures, extreme weather conditions or food shortages which, in
turn, could have an effect on the habitability of such countries and territories and the cost and feasibility of
providing telecommunications services. We have experienced similar disruptions in the past in our businesses in
the Dominican Republic. Moreover, the economies of certain jurisdictions in which we operate, including the
Dominican Republic, depend to a significant degree on global tourism, and environmental disruption has in the
past and may in the future have an adverse effect on the number of tourists visiting affected areas. The effects of
environmental disruption or other catastrophic events on our network infrastructure and equipment and on the
economies of the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Our business may be adversely affected by actual or perceived health risks and other environmental_**
**_requirements relating to exposure to electromagnetic fields through telecommunications equipment._**

We remain attentive to environmental risks that might arise or be discovered in the future and have adopted
programs aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable environmental regulations. Environmental and health
concerns are expressed in numerous countries and particularly arise in the context of the deployment of mobile
technology regarding exposure to electromagnetic fields through telecommunications equipment, relay antennas
and WiFi. A number of studies have been conducted to examine the health effects of mobile phone use and
network sites, and some of these studies have been construed as indicating that radiation from mobile phone use
causes adverse health effects. The World Health Organization has classified the radiofrequency of electromagnetic
fields, linked particularly with the use of cordless phones, as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”, but, to date, no
adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use.

Several lawsuits have been filed against mobile operators and other participants in the mobile industry alleging
adverse health effects and other claims relating to radio frequency transmissions to and from sites, handsets and
other mobile telecommunications devices, including lawsuits against HOT, which were settled during 2012 with
no material expenses incurred in such settlements. The Israeli government has contemplated, and in Portugal the
government has adopted, measures to regulate matters related to exposure to electromagnetic waves. These have
not, thus far, had a material impact on our business but there can be no guarantee that any future measures adopted
in a jurisdiction in which we operate will not have a material adverse impact on our business. The perception of
increased health risks related to mobile network sites may also cause us increased difficulty in obtaining leases
for new mobile network site locations or renewing leases for existing locations or otherwise in installing mobile
telecommunication devices. The fears generated by the potential health risks connected with electromagnetic
waves could also lead third parties to act against us by, for example, bringing actions demanding the withdrawal
of antennas or towers, which could affect our conduct of operations and the deployment of our network, and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. If it is ever determined
that health risks existed or that there was a deviation from radiation standards which would result in a health risk
from sites, other mobile devices or handsets, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations, including through exposure to potential liability, a reduction in subscribers
and reduced usage per subscriber. Furthermore, we do not expect to be able to obtain insurance with respect to
such liability.

**_If we are unable to obtain attractive content on satisfactory terms for our services, the demand for these services_**
**_could be reduced, thereby lowering revenue and profitability._**

The success of pay TV services depends on access to an attractive selection of television programming. For
example, the ability to provide movies, sports and other popular programming, including video-on-demand
(“VoD”) content, is a major factor that attracts subscribers to pay TV services, especially premium services. We
rely on digital programming suppliers for a significant portion of our programming content and VoD services. We
may not be able to obtain sufficient high quality programming and other content from third party producers for
our digital cable television and other services on satisfactory terms or at all in order to offer compelling digital
cable television services. We also rely on certain of our competitors for the provision of certain content offerings.
In addition, to the extent that we are unable to reach agreements with certain content providers on terms that we
believe are reasonable, we may be forced, or we determine for strategic or business reasons, to remove such
content from our line-up and may decide to replace them with other programming, which may not be available on
acceptable terms or be as attractive to customers. There can be no assurance that our expiring programming and


-----

other content contracts will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms or at all, or that the rights we negotiate
will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy. Further, with respect to our operations in Israel, we cannot
assure you that the local content we are required to develop in conjunction with our partner studios will continue
to be successful. The inability to obtain high quality content, may also limit our ability to migrate customers from
lower tier programming to higher tier programming, thereby inhibiting our ability to execute our business strategy.
In addition, we are currently subject to “must carry” requirements in certain of the jurisdictions in which we
operate that may consume channel capacity otherwise available for other services. Any or all of these factors could
result in reduced demand for, and lower revenue and profitability from, our digital cable television and other
content services.

Programming and content-related costs are one of our largest categories of expenses. In recent years, the cost of
programming in the cable and satellite video industries has increased significantly and is expected to continue to
increase, particularly with respect to costs for sports programming and broadcast networks. We may not be able
to pass these increased programming costs on to our subscribers due to the increasingly competitive environment
that we operate in. If we are unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our subscribers, our business,
financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, programming costs typically
include a minimum guaranteed amount and a variable amount related directly to the number of subscribers to
whom the programming is provided, which may affect our ability to negotiate lower per-subscriber programming
costs and which could impact our operating margins. The expiration dates of our various programming contracts
are staggered, which results in the expiration of a portion of our programming contracts throughout each year. We
may not be able to renegotiate these agreements on terms as favorable as those of the current agreements, or at all,
which could result in a decline in the revenue generated or an increase in our costs deriving from broadcaster
licences. We also face the risk of not being able to obtain new broadcast rights for content (including premium
sports content) or unexpected cancellations of the existing agreements as a result of factors beyond our control,
including due to termination of the rights or licenses held by third party content suppliers. We attempt to control
our programming costs and, therefore, the cost of our video services we charge to our customers, by negotiating
favorable terms for the renewal of our affiliation agreements with programmers. To the extent we are unable to
reach agreements with certain programmers on terms we believe are reasonable, we may be forced to, or determine
for strategic reasons to, remove certain programming from our line-up and may decide to replace such
programming with alternatives which may not be as attractive to consumers or available on acceptable terms.
Such negotiations have in the past and may in the future affect our carriage of particular programming services.

Some of our programming contracts require us to pay prices for the programming based on a guaranteed minimum
number of subscribers, even if that number is larger than the number of actual subscribers, whereas some of our
programming contracts are based on a flat fee irrespective of the popularity of the content purchased under such
contract. As a result, if we misjudge anticipated demand for the programming or if the programming we acquire
does not attract the number of viewers we anticipated, the profitability of our television services may be impaired.
Furthermore, as we purchase a significant portion of our content from various content providers under relatively
short term contracts, the prices we pay to purchase such content are subject to change and may increase
significantly in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

In addition, program providers and broadcasters may elect to distribute their programming through other
distribution platforms, such as satellite platforms, digital terrestrial broadcasting or IPTV, or may enter into
exclusive arrangements with other distributors. Such actions may inconvenience some of our subscribers and can
lead to customer dissatisfaction and, in certain cases, the loss of customers, which may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, as long as we continue to develop our VoD and other interactive services, our ability to acquire
programs for our free VoD offerings (replay), VoD by subscription, and one-time VoD will become more and
more crucial and will depend on our ability to maintain a relationship and cooperation with content providers and
broadcasters, for both standard-definition as well as HD content.

If we cannot obtain and keep competitive programs at attractive prices on our networks, demand for our services
could decline, thus limiting our ability to maintain or increase the revenue. A loss of programs or an inability to
ensure the availability of premium content under favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our
business activities, our financial position and results of operations.


-----

**_We depend on hardware, software and other providers of outsourced services, who may discontinue their_**
**_services or products, seek to charge us prices that are not competitive or choose not to renew contracts with us._**

We have important relationships with several suppliers of hardware, software and related services that we use to
operate our pay TV, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, mobile and business services businesses. In certain
cases, we have made substantial investments in the equipment or software of a particular supplier, making it
difficult for us to quickly change supply and maintenance relationships in the event that our initial supplier refuses
to offer us favorable prices or ceases to produce equipment or provide the support that we require. For example,
while we continue to promote a rapid take up of our premium multi-play services in several geographies where
we operate using a single set-top box, we face potential risks in securing the required customer set-top box
equipment to maintain this roll out as we currently rely on a single provider. Currently, we have a sufficient supply
of these boxes available, but any future shortages may involve significant delays in seeking alternative supplies,
may constrain our ability to meet customer demand and may result in increased customer churn.

There was an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in some categories of the supply chain in the Dominican
Republic, Israel and Portugal due to an increase of lead times (specifically for chipsets), increase in transportation
costs and delays in some shipments (mostly by sea). There has also been a shortage of chips globally.

Further, in the event that hardware or software products or related services are defective, it may be difficult or
impossible to enforce recourse claims against suppliers, especially if warranties included in contracts with
suppliers have expired or are exceeded by those in our contracts with our subscribers, in individual cases, or if the
suppliers are insolvent, in whole or in part. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain
the hardware, software and services we need for the operation of our business in a timely manner, at competitive
terms and in adequate amounts. In particular, in the case of an industry wide cyclical upturn or high demand for a
particular product, our suppliers of software, hardware and other services may receive customer orders beyond
the capacity of their operations, which could result in delivery delays, particularly where suppliers elect to
prioritize other customer accounts. We have, from time to time, experienced extensions of lead times or limited
supplies due to capacity constraints and other supply-related factors as well as quality control problems with
service providers. We may also not be able to recover monies paid to such suppliers or obtain contractual damages
to which we may be entitled (if any) in the event our suppliers fail to comply with their obligations in a timely
manner.

We also outsource some of our support services, including parts of our subscriber services, information technology
support, technical services, and maintenance operations. Should any of these arrangements be terminated by either
contract party, this could result in delays or disruptions to our operations and could result in us incurring additional
costs, including if the outsourcing counterparty increases pricing or if we are required to locate alternative service
providers or in-source previously outsourced services.

Further, we are dependent on certain suppliers with respect to our mobile services in Israel who we may not be
able to replace without incurring significant costs. With respect to our 3G/4G mobile operations, we have engaged
Nokia Solutions and Networks (“NSN”) as a turnkey contractor to plan and build the UMTS/LTE network core.
A cessation or interruption in the supply of the products and/or services by NSN may harm our ability to provide
our mobile services to our subscribers.

We are dependent on various third parties in order to provide commercially viable services in the jurisdictions in
which we operate. For example, among other agreements, we rely on the Partner Network Sharing Agreement to
hold, develop and operate an advanced shared mobile network in Israel and a Fiber Sharing Agreement with
Vodafone Portugal to deploy, share and manage fiber capacity in Portugal. We are generally dependent on access
to sites and network infrastructure owned by third parties, including duct space and antennas used for our networks
and facility space (colocation). In addition, our telephony services are reliant on our ability to interconnect with
the telecommunications networks of other fixed-line, mobile and international operators globally. We have limited
or no control over the quality and consistency of the services that are supplied to us by third parties. Any
deterioration in the provision of such services may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to renew our existing contracts with suppliers of products or services or enter into new contractual
relationships with these or other suppliers upon the expiration of existing agreements, either on commercially
attractive terms, or at all, depends on a range of commercial and operational factors and events which may be
beyond our control. The occurrence of any of these risks or a significant disruption in our supply of equipment
and services from key sourcing partners could create technical problems, damage our reputation, result in the loss


-----

of customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, including the risk that we may not be able to_**
**_integrate newly acquired operations into our business, which may prevent us from realizing the strategic and_**
**_financial goals contemplated at the time of any such transaction and thus adversely affect our business._**

Historically, our business has grown, in part, through a significant number of selective acquisitions that has
enabled us to take advantage of existing networks, service offerings and management expertise. Since 2010, we
have acquired HOT in Israel, PT Portugal in Portugal, Teads, a video advertising marketplace and Altice
Dominicana in the Dominican Republic. We may continue to grow our business through acquisitions of broadband
and mobile communications businesses, content companies and ancillary services that we believe will present
opportunities to create value by generating strong cash flows and operational synergies. In addition, we have in
the past few years entered into certain strategic transactions, such as the Towers Transactions, the sale of our voice
carrier business, to monetize the value of certain of our noncore assets in Portugal and the Dominican Republic,
the OMTEL Sale Transaction and the Altice Portugal FTTH Transaction. In the future, we may enter into similar
transactions in one or more countries in which we operate.

Any acquisition, disposal or other strategic transaction we may undertake in the future could result in the
incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expenses, amortization expenses related to
goodwill and other intangible assets or in the use by us of available cash on hand to finance any such acquisitions.
We may experience difficulties in integrating acquired operations into our business, incur higher than expected
costs or fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies of these acquisitions, if any. Such transactions
may also disrupt our relationships with current and new employees, customers and suppliers. In addition, our
management may be distracted by such acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses. Thus, if we
consummate any further acquisitions or fail to integrate any previous acquisitions, there could be a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we
will be successful in completing business acquisitions or integrating previously acquired companies. In addition,
our debt burden may increase if we borrow funds to finance any future transactions, which could have a negative
impact on our cash flows and our ability to finance our overall operations.

Acquisitions or disposals of additional telecommunications companies may require the approval of governmental
authorities (either domestically or, in the case of the EU, at the EU level), which can block, impose conditions on,
or delay the process which could result in a failure on our part to proceed with announced transactions on a timely
basis or at all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to
meet them in a timely manner, the relevant governmental authority may impose fines and, in connection with a
merger transaction, may require restorative measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of
operations. For example, in connection with the PT Portugal Acquisition, we entered into a commitment with the
European Commission (“EC”) to dispose of Cabovisão and ONI which was completed on January 20, 2016.
Additionally, in connection with the PT Portugal Acquisition, the EC is conducting an ongoing investigation
relating to Altice Europe’s alleged infringement of the obligation of prior notification of concentrations under
Article 4(1) of the EU Merger Regulation and/or of the standstill obligation laid down in Article 7(1) of the Merger
Regulation. The EC issued a statement of objections on May 18, 2017 alleging that Altice Europe breached the
Merger Regulation by implementing the PT Portugal Acquisition before notification or approval by the EC as
required under applicable law. On August 18, 2017, Altice Europe submitted a full response to the statement of
objections in which it contested all of the objections and requested that a hearing take place. A hearing took place
in Brussels on September 21, 2017. On April 24, 2018, the EC notified the Group of its decision to impose upon
it a fine of approximately €125 million on the basis of a finding that the Group infringed the prior notification
obligations of a concentration under Article 4(1) of the EU Merger Regulation as well as the stand-still obligation
under Article 7(1) of the Merger Regulation. The Group disputed the EC’s decision and on July 5, 2018, the Group
filed an appeal against the decision before the General Court of the European Union (“GCEU”) seeking an
annulment of the decision or, at the very least, a significant reduction in the fine imposed. On November 6, 2018,
the Council of the EU filed an application to intervene in the case. On July 25, 2018, the Group issued a bank
guarantee to the EC. On November 30, 2018, the EC lodged a defense, to which the Group replied on February
25, 2019, in line with the submissions set forth in its appeal. These proceedings do not affect the approval granted
by the EC for the PT Portugal Acquisition. See “Description of our Business—Legal Proceedings—Portugal—
_Regulatory and Civil Proceedings—European Commission Investigation into PT Portugal Acquisition” and_
“Description of Other Indebtedness—2018 Altice Financing Guarantee Facility”.


-----

Although we analyze and conduct due diligence on acquisition targets, our assessments are subject to a number
of assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations and our inquiries may fail
to uncover relevant information. There can be no assurance that our assessments or due diligence of and
assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may differ
significantly from our expectations. Moreover, our plans to acquire additional businesses in the future are subject
to the availability of suitable opportunities. Our competitors may also follow similar acquisition strategies and
may have greater financial resources available for investments or may be willing to accept less favorable terms
than we can accept, which may prevent us from acquiring businesses that we target to the benefit of our
competitors.

The operating complexity of our business and the responsibilities of management have increased significantly as
a result of the growth of our business through acquisitions, which may place significant strain on our managerial
and operational resources. We may be unable to allocate sufficient managerial and operational resources to meet
our needs as our business grows, and our current operational and financial systems and managerial controls and
procedures may become inadequate.

Although we consider the operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures that we
currently have in place to be adequate for our purposes, we recognize that the effectiveness of these systems,
controls and procedures needs to be kept under regular review as our business grows. We will have to maintain
close coordination among our logistical, technical, accounting, finance, marketing and sales personnel.
Management of growth will also require, among other things, continued development of financial and
management controls and information technology systems. The constant growth and increased international
operations may strain our managerial resources which may require us to hire additional managerial resources. We
may be unable to hire managers with the relevant expertise or the hiring process may require significant time and
resources, all of which could result in a disruption in our management, growth, operational and financial systems,
managerial controls and procedures and, accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Pressure on customer service could adversely affect our business._**

The volume of contracts handled by our customer service functions can vary considerably over time. The
introduction of new product offerings can initially place significant pressure on our customer service personnel.
Increased pressure on such functions is generally associated with decreased satisfaction of customers.

In the business services market, customers require service to be extremely reliable and to be re-established within
short timeframes if there is any disruption. Penalties are often payable in the case of failure to meet expected
service quality. In addition, product installation can be complex, requiring specialized knowledge and expensive
equipment. Delays and service problems may result in both penalties and the potential loss of customers. In these
segments, we rely on our experienced customer relations personnel to handle any customer issues or requests, and
the loss of such personnel can result in the loss of customers.

We have in the past experienced significant levels of customer dissatisfaction as a result of operational difficulties.
Improvements to customer service functions may be necessary to achieve desired growth levels and if we fail to
manage such improvements effectively and achieve such growth, we may in the future experience customer
service problems and damage to our reputation, contributing to increased churn and/or limiting or slowing our
future growth.

**_The possible inability to protect our image, reputation and brand and intellectual property could have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business._**

The brands under which we sell our products and services, including MEO, HOT, and Altice, are well recognized
brands in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic, as applicable. We have developed the brands we use
through extensive marketing campaigns, website promotions, customer referrals, and the use of a dedicated sales
force and dealer networks. For a description of our brands and offers, see “Description of Our Business—
_Significant Contracts”._

Our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance the image and reputation of our existing products and
services and to develop a favorable image and reputation for new products and services. The image and reputation
of our products and services may be adversely affected by several factors, including if concerns arise about (i) the
quality, reliability and benefit/cost balance of our products and services, (ii) the quality of our support centers or
(iii) our ability to deliver the level of service advertised. An event or series of events that threatens the reputation


-----

of one or more of our brands, or one or more of our products could have an adverse effect on the value of that
brand or product and subsequent revenues therefrom. Restoring the image and reputation of our products and
services may be costly and not always possible.

We rely upon copyright, trademark and patent laws to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, but
no assurance can be given that the actions they have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent
violation of our intellectual property rights. Adverse publicity, legal action or other factors could lead to
substantial erosion in the value of our brand, which could lead to decreased consumer demand and have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition and prospects.

Although we try to manage our brands, we cannot guarantee that our brands will not be damaged by circumstances
that are outside our control or by third parties such as hackers, sponsorees, or interfaces with our clients, such as
subcontractors’ employees or sales forces, with a resulting negative impact on our activities. In particular, our
image is increasingly tied to our innovative set-top box which we source from a third party supplier. A failure on
our part to protect our image, reputation and the brands under which we market our products and services may
have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_We are subject to requirements in terms of protection of personal data and data security._**

Within the context of our business activities, we must collect and process personal data, including that of current,
past and prospective employees, customers and the third parties with whom we work. We accumulate, store and
use data in the ordinary course of our operations that is protected by data protection laws. Regulatory authorities
in the jurisdictions in which we operate our businesses have the right to audit us as well as the right to impose
fines if they find we have not complied with applicable laws or adequately protected customer data. Some
jurisdictions allow individuals affected by our non-compliance to claim compensation or damages in certain
circumstances.

In the EU, the European Parliament and the European Council adopted the regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General
Data Protection Regulation, the “GDPR”) on April 27, 2016. The GDPR has been directly applicable in all EU
Member States since May 25, 2018, replacing Directive 95/46/EC and current national data protection legislation
in EU Member States, and was implemented in the EEA countries with effect from the same date. The purpose of
the GDPR is to provide for the protection of the individual’s right to privacy with respect to the processing of
personal data. The GDPR is directly applicable in all EEA Member States, creating a single legal framework that
results in a more uniform application of data privacy laws across the EU. The GDPR significantly changes the
EU/EEA data protection landscape, including strengthening of individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on
companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines of up to 4% of our
annual turnover. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to let a privacy organization litigate on their behalf,
including collecting the potential damages. After an initial transition period, data protection authorities across the
EU have now begun using their new sanctioning powers (in 2019, Google was fined €50 million by the French
authority (CNIL), and in 2020 British Airways and Marriott were fined £20 million and £18 million, Telecom
Italia was fined €28 million by the Italian Authority (GRANTA), and H&M €35 million by the regulator in
Hamburg, Germany (HmbBfDl). Many other and many cases are currently under investigation).

Following Brexit, the GDPR has been imposed in UK law pursuant to the U.K. General Data Protection
Regulation (“UK GDPR”). The UK’s data protection regime primarily consists of the UK GDPR and the U.K.
Data Protection Act 2018 (the “UK DP Laws”). The relationship between the UK and the EU in relation to certain
aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is also unclear how the UK DP Laws will develop in the
medium to longer term. However, the UK government recently announced its intention to adopt a more flexible
approach to the regulation of data, and as a result there remains a risk of future divergence between the EU and
UK data protection regimes.

The GDPR creates two main roles in data processing that of data controller and that of data processor. We will be
the data controller with respect to personal data that we collect and determine the use for, _i.e., processing_
employment related data of our employees, and a data processor where we act on behalf of clients, i.e., hosting
data or providing data-related services. In each role will be required to comply with the provisions of the GDPR
and where applicable the UK DP Laws, which are extensive and require consistent and thorough application. The
GDPR and UK DP Laws implement more stringent operational requirements and onerous accountability
obligations for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, requiring expanded disclosures


-----

about how personal data is to be used, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification
requirements, and higher standards for controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have
another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities.

Data controllers must put in place the necessary mechanisms to allow relevant individuals to exercise their data
subject rights, such as the right to access and rectify their personal data, the right to impose restrictions on
processing, and in certain circumstances the right to request the deletion of personal data, to request the transfer
of such data to another controller and to object to the processing of their personal data. The GDPR and the UK
GDPR provide that the Member States and the UK respectively may make their own additional laws and
regulations in relation to certain data processing activities, and may impose stricter governance requirements,
which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could require localized changes to our operating
models (if applicable).

Through our operations in Portugal, we do business in the hosting of data relating to the health of individuals,
which subjects us to the specific obligations provided for by the Public Health Code such as obtaining and
maintaining authorization or certification for the hosting of such data. If we breach our obligations or fail to adhere
to the requirements applicable to sensitive data processing, we may be subjected to criminal and financial penalties
likely to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations.

To the extent applicable, we are also subject to certain rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal
data out of the EEA and the UK. Recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and uncertainty
regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA and the United Kingdom to the U.S. Most recently, on July
16, 2020, the CJEU invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (“Privacy Shield”) under which personal
data could be transferred from the EEA to US entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme.

While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved
by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the
Privacy Shield), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances.
Use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the
legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of
individuals and additional measures and/or contractual provisions may need to be put in place, however, the
nature of these additional measures is currently uncertain. The CJEU went on to state that if a competent
supervisory authority believes that the standard contractual clauses cannot be complied with in the destination
country and the required level of protection cannot be secured by other means, such supervisory authority is
under an obligation to suspend or prohibit that transfer.

These recent developments are likely to require us to review and amend the legal mechanisms by which we make
and/or receive personal data transfers to/in the U.S. and other countries outside the EEA and the UK. As
supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances
where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used, and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer
additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer
personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which
we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations.

On January 1, 2021, following Brexit the UK became a third country for the purposes of EU law, such that
transfers of personal data from the EU to the UK are permitted only where there is a lawful mechanism under the
GDPR. In February 2021, the European Commission issued a draft finding of data protection adequacy for the
UK, which is currently being assessed by the European Data Protection Board and will thereafter require approval
from representatives of the EU Member States. If the draft finding is not finalised within six months of January
31, 2020, or the UK otherwise does not receive an adequacy finding, the business will no later than June 30, 2021
be required to safeguard transfers of personal data sent from the EU to the UK through the use of standard
contractual clauses or other approved mechanisms. This could create additional legal and compliance costs for the
business and could result in additional legal and regulatory risks where such transfers are not conducted in
accordance with the GDPR, the UK DP Laws and the requirements set out in the CJEU’s judgment.

Mirroring the scope of the GDPR local legislation is increasingly in favour of protecting personal data on an extraterritorial basis. Brazil has recently implemented the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (the “LGPD”),
enforcement of which began in May 2021 with penalties and sanctions for non-compliance provided therein being
enforced from August 1, 2021. The LGPD applies to organizations in Brazil as well as organizations that process
personal data for the purpose of offering or supplying goods and services to individuals in Brazil. In the United


-----

States, state consumer protection laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”),
which became effective on January 1, 2020, also establish privacy and security standards for use and protection
of data. The CCPA provides California residents with certain rights regarding the collection or processing of their
personal data, against any organization processing their data irrespective of location. Additionally, a recent
California ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), imposes additional data protection
obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and optouts for certain uses of sensitive data and sharing of personal data starting in January 2023. As voted into law by
California residents in November 2020, the CPRA could have an adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. We cannot yet fully predict the impact of the CCPA and CPRA, or subsequent
related regulations or guidance, on business or operations of Teads, but it may require us to further modify our
data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Local
data protection laws may have an impact on the business requiring changes to business models or processes and
create significant costs associated with litigation, settlements, regulatory action, judgments, liabilities or penalties.

In 2016, the CJEU further clarified what safeguards are required for data retention to be lawful. In the case of
_Tele2 Sverige and Home Secretary v. Watson, the court concluded that the EU Member States cannot impose a_
general obligation on providers of electronic telecommunications services to retain data, but did not ban data
retention altogether. Such retention is compatible with EU law if deployed against specific targets to fight serious
crime. Retention measures must be necessary and proportionate regarding the categories of data to be retained,
the means of communication affected, the persons concerned and the chosen duration of retention. Furthermore,
national authorities’ access to the retained data must be conditional and meet certain data protection safeguards.
New data retention rules are currently being discussed at an EU level in response to this decision.

In the case of Breyer, the CJEU concluded that IP addresses may constitute personal data where the individual
concerned can be identified, even where a third party must obtain additional data for the identification to take
place. This is now reflected in the drafting of the GDPR. The CJEU also held that website operators may rely on
a legitimate interest as a legal basis when retaining and using their visitors’ personal data. This is of major
importance for data retention rules; it follows that online media service providers can lawfully store their visitors’
personal data to pursue a legitimate interest, rather than just for the purposes previously outlined in the invalidated
Data Retention Directive. Thus, the grounds justifying data retention have become broader.

The EU e-Privacy Regulation which will replace the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive
2002/58/EC is currently in unagreed draft form. The EU e-Privacy Regulation covers not only personal data but
all access of a user’s equipment, which is usually made in relation to the placement of cookies, as well as issues
relating to the use of email for commercial marketing and for commercial marketing and telecommunications.
The current draft of the EU e-Privacy Regulation aligns issues such as consent with the GDPR. It also aligns the
potential fines for non-compliance with the 4% of turnover as set out in the GDPR. The EU e-Privacy Regulation
was first drafted to be implemented in May 2018 along with the GDPR, but as the text remains unapproved it is
unlikely that the EU e-Privacy Regulation will be implemented before 2021.

Regardless of the measures we adopt to protect the confidentiality, security of data and respect the rights of the
people whose data we process, there remains the risk of possible attacks or breaches of data processing systems,
which could give rise to penalties and damage our reputation. We could be compelled to incur additional costs in
order to protect against these risks or to mitigate the consequences thereof, which could in turn have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations or outlook. Furthermore, any loss of
confidence on the part of our customers as a result of such events could lead to a significant decline in sales and
have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_Our reputation and business could be materially harmed as a result of, and we could be held liable, including_**
**_criminally liable, for, data loss, data theft, unauthorized access or successful hacking._**

Our operations depend on the secure and reliable performance of our information technology systems as the nature
of our business involves the receipt and storage of information relating to our customers and employees. The
techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade services or sabotage systems change frequently
and often are not recognized until launched against a target and hardware, software or applications we develop or
procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly
compromise information security. We may be unable to anticipate these techniques or detect these defects, or to
implement effective and efficient countermeasures in a timely manner.


-----

If unauthorized third parties manage to gain access to any of our information technology systems, or if such
systems are brought down, unauthorized third parties may be able to misappropriate confidential information,
cause interruptions in our operations, access our services without paying, damage our computers or otherwise
damage our reputation and business. While we continue to invest in measures to protect our networks, any such
unauthorized access to our cable television service could result in a loss of revenue, and any failure to respond to
security breaches could result in consequences under our agreements with content providers, all of which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, as an
electronic communications services provider, we may be held liable for the loss, release or inappropriate
modification or storage conditions of customer or other data which are carried by our network or stored on our
infrastructures. In such circumstances, we could be held liable or be subject to litigation, penalties (including the
payment of damages and interest) or adverse publicity that could adversely affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could harm our business._**

Given the size and geographic spread of the Group, we are likely to be exposed to instances of employee fraud,
including, but not limited to, payroll fraud, falsification of expense claims, thefts of cash, assets or intellectual
property, false accounting and other misconduct. Individual employees may also act against our instructions and
either inadvertently or deliberately violate applicable law, including competition laws and regulations, by
engaging in prohibited activities such as price fixing or colluding with competitors regarding markets or clients,
or our internal policies. In addition, because we delegate a number of operational responsibilities to our
subsidiaries and our local managers retain autonomy regarding the management of our operations in their markets,
we may face an increased likelihood of the risks described above occurring. We also subcontract certain of our
maintenance, customer service, installation and other activities to third party suppliers acting on our behalf and
instances of fraud perpetuated by employees of these suppliers might also expose us to claims and/or may have a
detrimental impact on our brand and reputation. In addition, because we delegate a number of operational
responsibilities to our subsidiaries and our local managers retain substantial autonomy regarding the management
of our operations in their markets, we may face an increased likelihood of the risks described above occurring.

**_Our relations with our employees could be affected by changes in the competitive landscape._**

We operate in highly competitive and changing markets, which requires us to constantly adapt, anticipate and
adopt new measures in order to preserve our competitiveness and efficiency. This leads to regular changes in our
organizational structure and operations, which requires our employees to be flexible in responding to such changes.
This process requires mobilization and motivation of teams with our objectives. As a result, our business could
be affected by deterioration in labor relations with our employees, staff representative bodies or unions. Our ability
to maintain good relations with our employees, staff representative bodies and unions is crucial to the success of
our various projects. Therefore, we must continuously consult with staff representatives in order to ensure the
success of our current and future projects, which may delay the completion of certain projects. Furthermore,
projects may be poorly received by employees and lead to a deterioration in labor relations, which could, in turn,
lead to declines in productivity and possible labor disputes (e.g., strikes, disruptions), which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, planned decisions may not be well received by employees and may lead to a deterioration of the social
climate, causing decreases in productivity and potential social conflicts (work interruptions, disruptions, etc.).
Such situations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial situation and operational results.

**_We face risks arising from the outcome of various legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings._**

In the ordinary course of business, we become party to litigation and other legal proceedings, including
administrative and regulatory proceedings, and may be subjected to investigations and audits. Some of the
proceedings against us may involve claims for considerable amounts and may require that our general
management devote time to addressing such issues, to the detriment of managing the business. In addition, such
proceedings may result in substantial damages and/or may impair our reputation, which may result in a decline in
the demand for our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The outcome of these
proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, our results of operations or
our cash flows during the years when such disputes are decided or the sums potentially involved in them are paid.
We may also be exposed to proceedings that could involve our independent distributor partners, as well as other
telecommunications operators which are so exposed.


-----

We are currently involved in number of disputes and proceedings referred to in “Description of our Business—
_Legal Proceedings”. The costs that may result from these lawsuits are only recognized in our financial statements_
when it is more likely than not that a liability, resulting from past events, will be incurred and the amount of that
liability can be quantified or estimated within a reasonable range. In the Unaudited Financial Statements, tax and
legal disputes have been provisioned for an amount of €150 million in the aggregate (recorded in the Statement
of Financial Position under the lines ‘Provisions - current and non-current’, ‘Current tax liabilities’ and ‘Deferred
tax liabilities’), based on a case by case assessment of the risk level of each individual lawsuit, and events arising
during the course of legal proceedings may require a reassessment of this risk. The amount relating to the EC Fine
is included in our current liabilities, and hence a provision has not been recorded in the Unaudited Financial
Statements. Our assessment of risk is based both on the advice of legal counsel and on our estimate of the probable
settlement amounts that are expected to be incurred, if such a settlement would be agreed by both parties. Any
increase in the frequency or size of such claims could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash
flows and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

**_Our business may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which_**
**_our business depends or if we are subject to claims of intellectual property infringement._**

We rely primarily on copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and licenses and other agreements with our
employees, customers, suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in
content, technology and products and services used to conduct our businesses. However, our intellectual property
rights or those of our licensors could be challenged or invalidated, we could have difficulty protecting or obtaining
such rights or the rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of business opportunities, which
could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product and service offerings or other competitive
harm.

We have received, and may receive in the future, claims of infringement or misappropriation of other parties’
proprietary rights, particularly creative rights with respect to broadcasted programs. In addition to claims relating
to broadcasts on channels which we own, we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims with
respect to programs broadcast on the other channels, including foreign channels that we carry. Moreover, the
telecommunications industry is characterized by a high concentration of intellectual property rights, which
increases the risk of litigation resulting from our activities upon the grounds of prior rights of third parties.
Therefore, we are particularly exposed to the risk of proceedings initiated by patent trolls. See “—We may be
_subject to intellectual property infringement claims by “patent trolls””._

Any such claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation, regardless of the merits of
these claims. Successful challenges to our rights to intellectual property or claims of infringement of a third party’s
intellectual property could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur
substantial monetary liability or be temporarily or permanently prohibited from further use of the intellectual
property in question. This could require us to change our business practices and limit our ability to provide our
customers with the content that they expect. Even if we believe that the claims of intellectual property infringement
are without merit, defending against the claims can be time consuming and costly and may divert management’s
attention and resources away from our business. An inability on our part to effectively protect certain important
elements of our intellectual property rights and of our technology could have a material adverse effect on our
activities, financial position, results of operations or outlook.

**_We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by “patent trolls”._**

We may be the target of so-called “patent trolls” (also referred to as “non-practicing entities”), which have as their
core business the acquisition of patents and licenses, without actively producing goods or providing services, and
commonly litigate alleging that such patents or licenses have been infringed. We cannot exclude the possibility of
risk from contentious claims from “patent trolls”, which could have a material adverse effect on our business
activities, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The operation of our conditional access systems is dependent on licensed technology and subject to illegal_**
**_piracy risks._**

We operate conditional access systems to transmit encrypted digital programs, including our digital pay TV
packages and for billing our customers, which rely on the proper functioning of our conditional access systems.
Even though we require our conditional access system providers to provide state of the art security for the
conditional access systems, the security of our conditional access systems may be compromised by illegal piracy


-----

and other means. In addition, our set-top boxes require smart cards before subscribers can receive programming
and our smart cards have been and may continue to be illegally duplicated, providing unlawful access to our
television signals. While we work diligently to reduce the effect of piracy, there can be no assurance that we will
be able to successfully eliminate the piracy we currently face. In addition, there can be no assurance that any new
conditional access system security that we may put in place will not be circumvented. Encryption failures could
result in lower revenue, higher costs and increased basic cable subscriber churn or may otherwise have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_If we fail to successfully introduce new technologies or services, or to respond to technological developments,_**
**_our business and level of revenue may be adversely affected and we may not be able to recover the cost of_**
**_investments that we have made._**

Our business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services,
and it is difficult to forecast the impact such technological innovations will have on our business. If any new or
enhanced technologies, products or services that we introduce fail to achieve broad market acceptance or
experience technical difficulties, our revenue growth, margins and cash flows may be adversely affected. As a
result, we may not recover investments that we make in order to deploy these technologies and services. Enhanced
fixed service infrastructure access and mobile services provided by competing operators may be more appealing
to customers, and new technologies may enable our competitors to offer not only new services, but to also offer
existing standard services at lower prices. We may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep
pace with technological developments. It is possible that alternative technologies that are more advanced than
those we currently provide may be developed. We may not obtain the expected benefits of our investments if more
advanced technology is adopted by the market. While we attempt to stay ahead of the market, closely following
technological developments and making investments implementing such developments, it is difficult to forecast
the effect that technical innovations will have on our business. We may also be unable to adapt to new or existing
technologies to meet customer needs within an appropriate time frame, or a competitor may do so before us, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we
adopt new technologies in a timely manner as they are developed, the cost of such technology may exceed their
benefits. Our inability to obtain the funding or other resources necessary to expand or further upgrade our systems
and provide advanced services in a timely manner, or successfully anticipate the demands of the marketplace,
could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and generate revenue.

Furthermore, given the pace at which we launch new offers into the market and the multitude of our bundled
service offerings, we may experience vulnerability to revenue leakage as a result of the dynamic changes in
networks and IT systems. Our revenue chain consists of a complex set of inter-related technologies and processes
providing a seamless set of services to the end customer. Although we closely monitor the risks related to revenue
loss and continuously improve controls in our revenue assurance processes in order to prevent and/or detect cases
of revenue leakage, as the set of technologies and business processes grows bigger and more complex, the chance
of failure increases in each connection of the revenue chain. Revenue leakage may have an impact on the Group’s
ability to bill customers correctly for a given service or to receive the correct payment, which may adversely affect
our margins and profitability.

We anticipate that, over time, new products and services we may introduce will require upgraded or new customer
premises equipment, which may constrain our ability to market and distribute such new products and services.
For example, we do not expect that previously installed internet modems or set-top boxes will be able to support
all the enhancements we may introduce to our broadband internet or pay TV services over time. A portion of our
subscribers will therefore require some form of upgrade or potentially a replacement of their customer premises
equipment. Implementing such upgrades may entail additional costs to us and could delay the introduction of
enhanced services and therefore reduce our cash flow and profitability, particularly where customers rent such
customer premise equipment from us.

In addition, we will need to expend significant capital expenditure to fulfill universal service obligations and to
upgrade the parts of our networks that are xDSL. In particular, we must also continue to increase and improve the
functionality, availability, and characteristics of our network, particularly by improving its bandwidth capacity
and its 4G coverage, as well as introduction of 5G technology, to meet the growing demand for the services that
require very-high-speed telephony and internet services as the telecommunications industry in each of the markets
we operate is facing challenges relating to: (i) rapid, significant technological evolution; (ii) frequent improvement
of existing products or services resulting from the emergence of new technologies; and (iii) the establishment of
new industry practices and standards that make current systems and technologies obsolete. There can be no


-----

assurance that we will have sufficient capital to finance such upgrades or that such upgrades will generate a
positive return.

We may also be required to incur additional marketing and customer service costs in order to retain and attract
existing customers to any upgraded products and services we offer, as well as to respond to competitors’
advertising pressure, and potentially more extensive marketing campaigns, which may adversely affect our
margins. Any of the above occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_We rely on interconnecting telecommunications providers and could be adversely affected if such providers fail_**
**_to provide these services on a consistent basis and without disruption._**

Our ability to provide commercially viable telephone services in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends
upon our ability to interconnect with the telecommunications networks of fixed-line, mobile and international
operators in such jurisdictions in order to complete calls between our subscribers and parties on a fixed-line or
other mobile telephone network, as well as third parties abroad. Generally, fixed-line telephony, mobile and
international operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate are obliged by law to provide interconnection to,
and not to discriminate against, any other licensed telecommunications operator. We have no control over the
quality and timing of the investment and maintenance activities that are necessary for these entities to provide us
with interconnection to their respective telecommunications networks. In Israel, for instance, the implementation
of number portability requires us to rely on other providers to a greater extent since our ability to implement
number portability and to port numbers between operators is dependent on the manner of number portability
implementation by interconnecting local operators.

The failure of these or other telecommunications providers to provide reliable interconnections to us on a
consistent basis and under terms that are favorable to us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of our operations.

In addition, interconnection agreements and interconnection rates are normally subject to regulation in the
jurisdictions in which we operate. Reduced interconnection rates and other decisions by regulators may have a
material impact on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.

**_Our business activities and our development depend on our ability to enter into and maintain joint_**
**_arrangements with other players in the telecommunications field._**

We have entered into various contracts and arrangements with other players in the telecommunications field,
including mobile and wireless network sharing agreements and fiber sharing agreements. We are exposed to
various risks related to these agreements and arrangements. For instance, under the network sharing agreements,
we are dependent upon other players for a part of their networks. In particular, we may not have any direct
operational control of and may have no control over a portion of the networks that are managed by the
counterparties to the network sharing agreements. Therefore, we will not be able to control the quality of the
network through which we provide services to our customers or to implement corrective measures necessary in
the event of defect and will be exposed to the risk of failure on the part of its counterparties.

Additionally, our arrangements may fail to generate the expected synergies, especially in terms of geographic
coverage or quality of service. Delays in implementation may affect our ability to achieve the objectives of
geographic coverage and quality of service. Implementation of arrangements will also require significant capital
expenditures and there can be no assurance that we will be able to make a return on such investment or recoup
such investments.

Further, in the event of partial or total cessation and/or failure of such arrangements, we may have to redeploy
networks and/or incur significant capital expenditure on build-up or maintenance of networks in the zones covered
by such agreements so as to maintain our geographic coverage and the quality of services. Moreover, we cannot
guarantee that we will be able, in such a scenarios, to implement coverage equivalent to that enjoyed by customers
under our joint agreements.

The competent authorities may, in the future, make decisions jeopardizing the overall economics and/or validity
of such arrangements with other players in the market. Third parties may also seek to gain access to shared
networks and take action against us and our partners.


-----

We have entered into roaming contracts, which provide our customers with international 3G and 4G roaming
services, across all geographies where we operate. These contracts are generally subject to rights of termination
upon sufficient notice, in the event of a material breach or upon the commencement of liquidation or insolvency
proceedings. In the event that we are unable to reach agreements with third parties or favorably renegotiate or
renew our existing roaming, network sharing agreements or other agreements on terms we believe are reasonable,
our fixed-based and mobile services may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that our agreements will be
renewed on favorable or comparable terms. See “Description of our Business—Significant Contracts—Portugal—
_Fiber Sharing Agreement with Vodafone Portugal” and “Description of our Business—Significant Contracts—_
_Israel—Mobile Network Sharing Agreement with Partner in Israel”._

**_We rely on third parties for access to, and the operation of, certain parts of our network._**

We are generally dependent on access to sites and land belonging to, and network infrastructure owned by, third
parties, including for mobile infrastructure, cable duct space and antennas used for our networks and facility space
(colocation). In this respect, we have generally obtained leases, rights and licenses from network operators,
including incumbent operators, governmental authorities and individuals. For example, in July 2014, we signed
the Vodafone Network Sharing Agreement with Vodafone Portugal to deploy, swap capacity and share fiber
networks beginning in December 2014, for an initial term of 25 years. See “Description of our Business—
_Significant Contracts—Portugal—Fiber Sharing Agreement with Vodafone Portugal”. In addition, in November_
2013 we entered into a Network Sharing Agreement with Partner pursuant to which HOT Mobile and Partner own
equal shares and have joint control of Phi Networks (2015) Limited Partnership (“PHI”), which holds, develops
and operates an advanced shared mobile network for both companies in Israel. Regulatory approval for the
network sharing agreement was obtained on April 20, 2015 and such agreement remains valid until December 31,
2028. Our ability to offer our services to customers depends on the performance of these third parties of their
obligations under such leases, licenses and rights. If we are not able to renew our current lease agreements for
these sites and/or enter into new lease agreements for suitable alternate sites, this could have a negative impact on
the coverage of our network. If third parties refuse to or only partially fulfill their obligations under or terminate
the licenses granted to us or prevent the required access to certain or all of such sites, it could prevent or delay the
connection to sites or customers, limit the growth of our offerings and influence our ability to supply high quality
services to our customers in a timely and cost effective manner. In addition, the costs of providing services is
dependent on the pricing and technical terms under which we are given such access and any change in such terms
may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In many cases,
we may not be able to find suitable alternatives at comparable cost or within a reasonable timeframe.

**_The continuity of our services strongly depends on the proper functioning of our IT and network infrastructure_**
**_and any failure of this infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial_**
**_position and results of our operations._**

The reliability and quality (both in terms of service as well as availability) of our information systems and
networks, particularly for our mobile and fixed businesses, are key components of our business activities, the
continuity of our services and the confidence of our customers. More specifically, the unavailability or failure of
information systems we use, our network, the production of “electronic” communications services and television,
our website, and our customer service function, could significantly disrupt our business.

A flood, fire, other natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, power failure, cyber-attack, computer virus or other
catastrophe affecting a portion of our network could have a material adverse impact on our business and our
relations with customers. For example, our business in the Dominican Republic has experienced network
disruptions and other adverse effects in the past, and may experience network disruption and other adverse effects
in the future, as a result of extreme weather and other environmental conditions. Measures with the aim of
remedying such disasters, safety and security measures, or measures for protecting service continuity that we
undertake or may undertake in the future, as well as the effects thereof on the performance of our network, could
be insufficient to avoid losses. As we are insured against operating losses only up to a capped amount, any disaster
or other damage affecting our network could result in significant uninsured losses. Our network may be subjected
to disruptions and to significant technological problems, and such difficulties could escalate over time. For
example, although our cable networks are generally built in resilient rings to ensure the continuity of network
availability in the event of any damage to our underground fibers, if any ring is cut twice in different locations,
transmission signals will not be able to pass through, which could cause significant damage to our business. In
the event of a power outage or other shortage, we do not have a back-up or alternative supply source for all of our
network components. The occurrence of any such event could cause interruptions in service or reduce capacity


-----

for customers, either of which could reduce our revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses. In addition, the
occurrence of any such event may subject us to penalties and other sanctions imposed by regulators. Further, we
may incur costs and revenue losses associated with the unauthorized use of our networks, including administrative
and capital costs associated with the unpaid use of our networks as well as with detecting, monitoring and reducing
the incidences of fraud. Fraud also impacts interconnection costs, capacity costs, administrative costs and
payments to other carriers for unbillable fraudulent roaming charges.

Additionally, our business depends on certain crucial systems, particularly our network operations center and our
billing and customer service systems. In particular, the support for a large number of systems critical to our
network is located at a relatively limited number of sites. While we have extensive backup systems, the risk that
these systems may not be sufficient to handle a spike in activity cannot be ruled out, which could lead to a
slowdown or unavailability of IT systems for a period of time and, when involving our business services customers,
to financial penalties. Moreover, we may incur legal penalties and reputational damages to the extent that any
accident or security breach results in a loss of or damage to customers’ data or applications, or inappropriate
disclosure of confidential information.

Moreover, our technical projects that are in progress, involving both information systems and networks, and the
plans for migrations planned in the short and medium terms for certain pieces of mobile network equipment, may
generate an increased risk of failures of networks and information systems. In particular, the quality of the
networks could be impacted by the deployment of the 4G and 5G networks as well as by the concurrent work of
renovating 2G and 3G networks, requiring, among other things, frequent technical interventions. Such work could
also result in breakdowns or interruptions in services for our customers.

Furthermore, the development of the resources used by consumers (for example, videoconferencing, telepresence,
and cloud computing for business services customers), of the IoT, and of new terminals (smartphones, tablets,
etc.) may generate risks of saturating the networks due to the large volumes of data that such resources generate
or promote the use of.

The end-of-year period is an extremely sensitive sales period. A major failure of the information systems or of
any component of the chain of production and logistics during that period would have negative consequences on
revenues. To reduce the likelihood of this type of risk occurring, we avoid changes to our network and information
systems during this period of the year (starting in mid-November until the end of the year), however, there can be
no assurance that there will be no failure of our network and information systems during the end-of-year period.

Should all or some of the risks described above materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our reputation and financial condition may be negatively affected by problems with the quality and availability_**
**_of our products._**

Many of our products and services, including LaBox technology, which we have rolled out in some geographies
where we operate are produced and/or maintained using complex and precise technological processes. These
complex products and services may contain defects or experience failures when first introduced or when new or
improved versions are released. Despite the testing procedures we have implemented, we cannot guarantee that
faults will not be found in our new products and services after their launch. Such faults could result in a loss of or
delay in market acceptance of our products and services, increased costs associated with customer support, delays
in service, delayed revenue generation or loss of revenues, defective products eliminated from inventories and
replacement costs, or could undermine our reputation with our customers and within the industry.

Any loss of confidence by our customers may cause sales of our other products and services to drop significantly.
Furthermore, we may have difficulty identifying customers of defective products and services. As a result, we
could incur substantial costs to implement modifications and correct defects. Any of these problems could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, demand for
our products or the products we offer as part of our services, including TV decoders, high-speed routers, mobile
handsets, among others, may increase rapidly. We may fail to accurately estimate the demand for those products
and services, which could result in a temporary shortage of supply leading to a drop in new subscriptions for our
services and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation.


-----

**_Customer churn, or the threat of customer churn, may adversely affect our business._**

Our ability to attract and retain subscribers to our fixed-based services or to increase profitability from existing
subscribers will depend in large part on our ability to stimulate and increase subscriber usage, convince subscribers
to switch from competitors’ services to our services and our ability to minimize customer churn. Customer churn
is a measure of the number of customers who stop subscribing for one or more of our products or services. Churn
arises mainly as a result of the contractual subscription period (generally 12 months in the residential segment and
between one and three years in the business services segment), competitive influences, the relocation of clients
outside of the Group’s network areas, introduction of new products and technologies, deterioration of personal
financial circumstances, price increases and regulatory developments. Customer churn may also increase if we
are unable to deliver satisfactory services over our network, or if we modify the types of services we make
available in a certain region. In addition, customer churn also arises upon the cancellation of services to customers
who are delinquent in their payments to the Group. In addition, we outsource many of our customer service
functions to third party contractors over which we have less control than if we were performing those tasks
ourselves. We have experienced significant churn in mobile and fixed customers in recent years due to intense
competition.

For example, in Israel, the regulatory framework prohibits, among other things, fixed-based service providers and
mobile operators from charging exit fees, except in limited circumstances, to subscribers who wish to terminate
their services and mobile operators are prohibited from selling locked handsets or linking the terms of sale of
handsets to the terms of mobile services, including discounts and other benefits, which has increased churn rates
for many fixed-based service providers and mobile operators. If we fail to effectively communicate the benefits
of our networks through our marketing and advertising efforts, we may not be able to attract new customers and
our efforts to attract and retain customers may prove unsuccessful. In addition, any interruption of our services or
the removal or unavailability of programming, which may not be under our control, could contribute to increased
customer churn. Further our competitors may improve their ability to attract new customers, for example by
offering new product bundles or product offerings at lower prices than us, which would make it difficult for us to
retain our current subscribers, and the cost of retaining and acquiring new subscribers could increase. In addition,
our business services operations are also subject to tariff churn (i.e. an existing customer negotiating tariff
decreases). Large corporate customers in particular are highly sophisticated and often aggressive in seeking to
renegotiate the pricing of their contracts, which tends to result in margin pressure. Increased customer or tariff
churn may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We have significant post-retirement benefit and healthcare obligations, the payment of which may have an_**
**_adverse effect on our business and, therefore, our ability to service our debt obligations._**

Our defined benefits obligations, including pension supplements, healthcare benefits and salaries payable to preretired and suspended employees, amounted to €958 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to
€1,075 million and €785 million in the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
Salaries payable to pre-retired and suspended employees are obligations under individual agreements with
employees to pay employees a significant portion of their previous existing salary to refrain from working until
retirement. In Portugal, we launched voluntary employee reduction programs in January 2019 and March 2021,
aimed at employees aged 50 years or more, in accordance with which their employment agreements shall be
terminated, and those employees will be entitled to receive a monthly fixed compensation up to retirement age
corresponding to a significant percentage of their previous remuneration that varies based on the age of the
employees. The January 2019 scheme covered approximately 850 employees (mainly in support functions). Under
the March 2021 scheme, as of March 31, 2021, we have reached agreements with approximately 750 employees
and recognized a liability of €241 million, corresponding primarily to the present value of salaries payable up to
retirement age to the employees that agreed to terminate their employment agreements under pre-retirement
schemes. Based on information up to date, we expect to record an additional liability in the second quarter of 2021
relating to approximately 200 employees.

Further, in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Portugal, there is no legislation on the establishment
of funds to cover the healthcare obligations and the salaries for pre-retired and suspended employees, and PT
Portugal is required to pay for these benefits only when the salaries are paid to pre-retired and suspended
employees, or when healthcare expenses are incurred. Accordingly, there is no requirement in Portugal to fund
these benefits obligations at present. However, PT Portugal has nevertheless set up a fund managed by a subsidiary,
PT Prestações—Mandatária de Aquisições e Gestão de Bens, S.A., to finance the such healthcare-related postretirement liabilities. No similar fund has been established to pay salaries owed to pre-retired and suspended
employees. The value of the obligations referred to above may also fluctuate, depending on demographic, financial,


-----

legal or regulatory factors that are beyond our control. For example, the legal retirement age in certain of the
jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Portugal, has been raised in the past and may be raised further in the
future which could increase our obligations to pay salaries to suspended and pre-retired employees. The payment
of these obligations may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, in Israel, employees are entitled to receive severance pay pursuant to law and we are required to maintain
defined benefit plans in respect of such severance pay. For a discussion of certain significant defined benefit plans
of the Group, see Note 2.24 of the 2020 Financial Statements included in this Offering Memorandum.

**_We are exposed to local business risks in many different countries._**

We operate our business in multiple jurisdictions, including Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic. In
addition, we may expand into additional markets in the future by entering into acquisitions or other strategic
transactions. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks resulting from differing legal, political, social and
economic conditions, regulatory requirements and unforeseeable developments in a variety of jurisdictions,
including in emerging markets (which may be more vulnerable to volatility as well as political and economic
instability than developed markets). These risks include, among other things:

- differing economic cycles and adverse economic conditions;

- political instability (including expropriation and political violence or disturbance);

- the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;

- unexpected changes in the regulatory environment and/or governmental policies;

- varying tax regimes;

- fluctuations in currency exchange, interest rates and inflation (particularly in emerging markets, such as the
Dominican Republic, which has historically experienced high rates of inflation);

- inability to collect payments or seek recourse under or comply with ambiguous or vague commercial or other
laws;

- varying degrees of concentration among suppliers and customers;

- insufficient protection against violations of our intellectual property rights;

- foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of funds;

- added complexity and risk of deficiency in the risk management and internal control processes;

- difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management and employees, or further rationalizing our work
force;

- significant oil price increases; and

- challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences.

Our overall success as a business depends to a considerable extent on our ability to anticipate and effectively
manage differing legal, political, social and economic conditions and regulatory requirements and unforeseeable
developments. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies which
will be effective in each location in which we do business or may do business in the future.

**_We are exposed to economic, political and other risks related to the Dominican Republic._**

The Dominican Republic is an emerging market economy and as such is more vulnerable to market volatility as
well as political and economic instability than developed markets. Risks associated with operating in the
Dominican Republic include, but are not limited to:


-----

- high interest rates;

- devaluation or depreciation of the currency;

- inflation;

- changes in governmental economic, tax or other policies;

- the potential introduction of exchange controls;

- the imposition of trade barriers;

- dependence on remittances and tourism;

- the scarcity of available foreign exchange;

- significant oil price increases and commodity price volatility (especially with regards to gold);

- economic and political instability; and

- expropriation and political violence or disturbance.

Our operations could be affected by changes in the economic or other policies of the Dominican Republic
government or other political, regulatory or economic authorities in the country. Historically, past governments
have intervened in the nation’s economy. Among other things, past governments have imposed import and export
controls. There can be no assurance that controls, such as exchange controls, will not be introduced in the future.
Future developments in the Dominican Republic politics, such as changes in economic, political or regulatory
policies including government induced effects on inflation, devaluation and economic growth, could adversely
affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations.

Historically, the Dominican Republic has experienced high rates of inflation. Inflation, as well as government
efforts to combat inflation or stabilize DOP, has in the past had significant negative effects on the Dominican
Republic economy, most recently in 2003 and 2004, when inflation rates, as measured by the Dominican
Consumer Price Index (Indice de Precios al Consumidor, or the Dominican CPI) were 42.7% and 28.7%,
respectively, resulting from an acute economic crisis precipitated by the collapse of Baninter, the country’s second
largest commercial bank in terms of deposits, that required the government to finance a bailout. Inflation rates in
the last five years, as measured by this index, were 1.7% in 2016, 4.2% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018, 3.7% in 2019 and
5.6% in 2020.

DOP has also been subject to volatility in the past and could be subject to significant fluctuations in the future
given the prevalence of a free float exchange regime. The main drivers of exchange rate volatility in recent years
have been significant fluctuations in commodity prices as well as general uncertainty and trade imbalances in
regional and global markets. The value of DOP against the U.S. dollar may continue to fluctuate significantly in
the future, which may negatively impact the strength of the Dominican Republic’s economy and therefore
adversely affect demand for our products and services.

The Dominican Republic also has significant external public debt and in the past has been required to restructure
such debt, including in 1991 and 2005.

In addition, the Dominican Republic is facing an on-going crisis in the electricity sector. Electricity generators
and distributors have been beset by financial problems that have resulted in frequent blackouts, widespread public
protests and several temporary and permanent shutdowns of generating plants. As a consequence, the government
has nationalized the three distribution companies and is regularly required to partially finance the current deficit
of the electricity distributors. This crisis could have a material adverse impact on the Dominican Republic’s
economic growth, the penetration rate for telecommunication services and the non-availability or higher prices of
electricity could directly impact our business and the businesses of our customers. In addition, we have been in
the past, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory customer compensation obligations as a result of network
shutdowns due to electricity blackouts that are beyond our control.


-----

Each of these factors could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Altice Dominicana’s
business, reputation, financial conditions or result of operations.

**_We are exposed to risks of consumer fraud._**

As a telecommunications operator, we are exposed to risks of fraud in our various activities. These risks are linked
in particular with fraudulent subscriptions and orders for the purchase of subsidized terminals and telephone lines.
Furthermore, the change in the usage of mobile telephony services and applications against a backdrop of the
marketing of new offers, as well as the development of new means of payment, could encourage fraud. The
occurrence of such fraudulent activity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Our future revenue growth depends in part on market acceptance of new product introductions and product_**
**_innovations._**

In general, the telecommunications industry is characterized by the frequent introduction of new products and
services or upgrading of existing products and services, in connection with new technologies, as well as changes
in usage patterns and in customer needs and priorities. Our long term results of operations therefore depend
substantially upon our ability to continue to conceive, design, source and market new products and services as
well as continuing market acceptance of our existing and future products and services. Should we fail to or be
significantly delayed in introducing new products and services in the future, if our new products and services are
not accepted by customers, or if our competitors introduce more sophisticated or more popular products and
services, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.

**_Our reputation is in part dependent on our relationship with our third party providers._**

We rely on third-party suppliers to provide services to our customers and to perform our business activities. We
utilize suppliers of equipment and software, including suppliers of TV decoders, conditional access system
suppliers, as well as suppliers of high-speed routers and mobile terminals. We also employ the services of
subcontractors to maintain our network, manage our call centers, and supply, install, and maintain equipment set
up at private households and at the premises of business services customers. We cannot guarantee the quality of
such services or that these services will comply with the quality and safety standards we impose or require. If
there are defects in the equipment or software or the services involving these products, or if the tasks of our
subcontractors are not performed properly, it may be difficult or even impossible to make a claim against the
suppliers or subcontractors, particularly if the warranties provided for in the contracts entered into with suppliers
or subcontractors are not as extensive as those contained in the contracts entered into between us and our customers
in certain specific cases or if these suppliers or subcontractors are insolvent or have suspended payments. These
difficulties could undermine relations between us and our customers, as well as the reputation of our brand.

Any delay or failure by our third parties suppliers in providing services or products, any increase in their prices,
or any decision not to renew their contracts with us could lead to delays or interruptions in our activities. In
addition, in many cases we make significant investments in the equipment or software of a particular supplier,
which makes it more difficult to rapidly change our procurements or maintenance services if our original supplier
refuses to offer us favorable prices or ceases to produce equipment or provide services that we require. If any of
these risks materialize, technical problems could arise, our reputation could be impaired and customers could be
lost, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business activities, our financial position and our results
of operations. See “Description of our Business—Suppliers”.

**Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters**

**_We are subject to significant government regulation and supervision, which could require us to make additional_**
**_expenditures or limit our revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business, and further regulatory changes_**
**_could also adversely affect our business._**

Our activities as a cable television, broadband internet infrastructure access provider, ISP, fixed-line and
international long distance telephony and mobile operator are subject to regulation and supervision by various
regulatory bodies, including local and national authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulation
and supervision, as well as future changes in laws or regulations or in their interpretation or enforcement that
affect us, our competitors or our industry, strongly influence how we operate our business. Complying with
existing and future law and regulations may increase our operational and administrative expenses, restrict our


-----

ability or make it more difficult to implement price increases, affect our ability to introduce new services, force
us to change our marketing and other business practices, and/or otherwise limit our revenues. In particular, our
business could be materially and adversely affected by any changes in relevant laws or regulations (or in their
interpretation) regarding, for example, licensing requirements, access and price regulation, interconnection
arrangements or the imposition of universal service obligations, or any change in policy allowing more favorable
conditions for other operators or increasing competition. There can be no assurance to you that the provision of
our services will not be subject to greater regulation in the future. Furthermore, a failure to comply with the
applicable rules and regulations could result in penalties, restrictions on our business or loss of required licenses
or other adverse consequences.

Although the regulations applicable to our businesses vary depending on jurisdiction, such regulations may
include, amongst other things:

- in certain jurisdictions, price regulation for certain of the services we offer, exit fees and cancellation charges;

- rules governing the interconnection between different telephone networks and the interconnection rates that
we can charge and that we pay;

- requirements that, under specified circumstances, a cable system carry certain broadcast stations or obtain
consent to carry a broadcast station;

- rules for authorizations, licensing, acquisitions, renewals and transfers of licenses and franchises;

- requirements that we provide or contribute to the provision of certain universal services;

- rules and regulations relating to subscriber privacy and data protection;

- rules and regulations relating to our networks, including universal access obligations imposed on us, coinstallation and co-location obligations (including our submarine cable landing stations), right of way and
ownership considerations;

- rules governing the copyright royalties;

- requirements on portability; and

- other requirements covering a variety of operational areas such as equal employment opportunity, emergency
alert systems, disability access, technical standards, environmental standards, city planning rules and
customer service and consumer protection requirements.

The regulations applicable to our operations within the EU often derive from EU Directives. The various
Directives require EU Member States to harmonize their laws on communications and cover such issues as access,
user rights, privacy and competition. These Directives are reviewed by the EU from time to time and any changes
to them could lead to substantial changes in the way in which our businesses in the relevant jurisdictions are
regulated and to which we would have to adapt.

In Israel, we are also subject to, among other things, regulations requiring us to maintain structural separation
between our cable television, broadband internet infrastructure access and fixed-line telephony, and between our
ISP and mobile subsidiaries, regulations restricting the number of channels we can own and specifying the
minimum investment we are required to make in local content productions and requirements that we extend our
cable television, broadband internet infrastructure access and fixed-line telephony services to areas of Israel even
where it is not economically profitable to do so. In July 2019, the Ministry of Communications decided to enable
us to provide our services in areas without cable infrastructure using technological alternatives, on a technological
neutrality basis. The Israeli Ministry of Communications has taken active steps to increase competition in the
fixed-line and mobile telecommunications industries, including providing licenses to MVNOs and eliminating
termination fees that operators can charge, except in limited circumstances, and prohibiting the linkage of the
price and terms of handsets to the services or benefits of the mobile contract. The Israeli Ministry of
Communications has also introduced a policy for the establishment of a wholesale market for broadband internet
infrastructure access pursuant to which certain limitations on structural separation and bundling of products may
be reduced, but we would also be required to provide access to our network infrastructure to other service
providers on a wholesale basis. In June 2020, the Israeli Ministry of Communications allowed HOT to offer


-----

packages including our triple-play services together with HOT Net’s ISP services, subject to certain conditions.
In February 2021, the Israeli Ministry of Communications published a decision allowing us to offer HOT Mobile’s
mobile services in our multi-play service packages as well, subject to the prior approval of the Israeli Ministry of
Communications. On May 30, 2021, the Ministry of Communications approved the marketing of quad-play
packages including triple-play services with HOT Net’s ISP services and HOT Mobile’s mobile cellular services.

Further, in November 2014 the Israeli Ministry of Communications issued regulatory instructions, including the
method of setting wholesale service rates and, in the case of Bezeq, the maximum rates that can be collected by
Bezeq from other license holders who make use of its infrastructure for the years 2014 to 2018, in an attempt to
create a wholesale market for broadband internet infrastructure access and fixed-line telephony services which
would allow service providers (such as ISPs, VOB providers and IPTV providers) to provide services to their
customers by using our cable network. In June 2017, following a hearing, the Ministry of Communications
published the maximum tariffs for supplying wholesale services over HOT Telecom Limited Partmership (“Hot
**Telecom”)’s network for the years 2017 and 2018. Should the wholesale market develop, certain requirements**
for structural separation and bundling of products that apply to Bezeq and us may be lifted, and at the same time,
competition in the broadband internet infrastructure access market may increase significantly which could
negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In September 2019, the Ministry of
Communications relaxed the requirements for structural separation within the HOT group relating to the business
sector, which enables HOT to provide certain customers in the business sector with broadband internet
infrastructure access and mobile telephony services. In addition, following a hearing published in 2014, the
Ministry of Communications gave notice in August 2017 of a further hearing regarding the mechanism to examine
retail offers made by HOT and Bezeq to new or existing subscribers, to avoid ‘margin squeeze’ practices but no
decision was made in this respect. In October 2015, the Minister of Communications appointed an advisory
committee to advise on the regulation of the broadcast market. In February 2016, the advisory committee
published a report setting out its recommendations in relation to regulations that will apply to new and existing
operators in the broadcasting area, regulations that will apply with respect to the commercial channels, the
investments rates in local productions and other issues. On June 30, 2016, the Ministry of Communications
published the committee’s final report. In addition, in March 2016, the Cable & Satellite Broadcasting Council
published a decision with respect to a new policy regarding setting tariffs and offerings of HOT. This policy may
limit our ability to increase prices in existing plans. Furthermore, in December 2019, the Ministry of
Communications published for review and hearing, updated regulations governing maximum tariffs for wholesale
BSA services on HOT’s network in 2019-2022. According to the hearing, the Ministry is considering a change in
the method for determining the maximum tariffs, from a cost-reflected model to a “retail minus” model, due to
the Ministry’s claim that HOT used “margin squeeze” practices in its retail pricing. In June 2020, within the scope
of the Israeli Ministry of Communications’ decision to enable HOT to offer service bundles including HOT Net’s
ISP services, the Israeli Ministry of Communications approved HOT’s proposal regarding new wholesale tariffs
in its network as an alternative for the hearing.

Further, on July 10, 2018, the Ministry of Communications proposed certain amendments to the current
regulations governing the multichannel TV market, in order to adapt to recent technological changes in the market.
Such proposed regulations will apply to audio-visual content providers that attain a certain market share, with the
goal of encouraging competition and reducing the regulatory burden. In October 2020, a committee appointed by
the Minister of Communications published a public hearing regarding the future macro-regulation of the
broadcasting market in Israel, including with respect to reduction of regulation, local productions, regulators’
structure, economic models in the market, regulating sports broadcasting and ratings measurement. HOT
submitted its position, according to which, the regulation should be equal and technologically neutral.

In addition, we are subject to antitrust rules and regulations and are, from time to time, subject to review by
authorities concerning whether we exhibit monopoly power in any of the market in which we operate. To the
extent that we are deemed by relevant authorities to exhibit significant market power, we can be subject to various
regulatory obligations adversely affecting our results of operations and profitability.

Regulatory authorities may also require us to grant third parties access to our bandwidth, frequency capacity,
facilities or services to distribute their own services or resell our services to end customers. Currently, we are
considered to have significant market power with respect to certain services in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican
Republic. No assurance can be given that we will not be identified as having significant market power in any
relevant markets in the future and that we will not be subject to additional regulatory requirements.

**_The European Commission’s “Digital Single Market” legislation could adversely affect our business._**


-----

The EU Regulation 531/2012, which initially set a rate for roaming, was further amended through the regulation
2015/2120 of November 25, 2015 to establish the conditions and the viability of a removal of retail roaming
charges from June 15, 2017 (“roam like at home” subject to fair-usage). Moreover, the regulation introduced
measures relating to “net neutrality”.

Furthermore, the roaming regulation was completed by other pieces of legislation:

- implementing Regulation EU 2016/2286 of December 15, 2016 laying down detailed rules on the application
of fair use policy and on the methodology for assessing the sustainability of the abolition of retail roaming
surcharges and on the application to be submitted by a roaming provider for the purposes of that assessment;
and

- Regulation EU 2017/920 of May 17, 2017 amending Regulation (EU) no. 531/2012 with respect to rules for
wholesale roaming markets.

The EC’s proposals on telecommunications markets presented in September 2016 were intended to fix rules to
support the creation of Gigabit Society. The electronic communications code proposal aimed to make investment
in very high capacity networks a binding objective and it also aimed to promote sustainable long term competition.
It was adopted through Directive 2018/1972 of December 11, 2018 establishing the European Electronic
Communications Code (the “EECC”), which entered into force on December 20, 2018.

This legislation is expected to have an impact on our operations. However, the EECC has not yet been enacted
into its national laws by Portugal, but in case the Portuguese law is on the same lines as the EECC, the Group
could be impacted by, among other things, reduction of the loyalty periods, introduction of automatic
compensation rules when the entity does not meet minimum quality levels related to the reparation of services,
new portability rules for the internet service and new information requirements to be provided to customers.

_Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 11, 2018 establishing the_
_European Electronic Communications Code._

The EECC was adopted on December 11, 2018 and came into force on December 20, 2018. The EECC brings
together the rules on electronic communications networks and services and aligns them with the latest
technological developments.

The EECC regulates (i) electronic communications networks and electronic communications services (“ECN”
and “ECS”), (ii) associated facilities and services, (iii) the authorization of networks and services, (iv) radio
spectrum use and numbering resources, (v) access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks
and associated facilities and (vi) the protection of end-users.

It aims to:

- promote connectivity, access to and take-up of very high capacity networks by all citizens and businesses of
the EU;

- promote competition in the provision of electronic communication networks and services;

- contribute to the development of the internal market in the field of electronic communications networks and
services, radio spectrum and connectivity; and

- promote the interests of European citizens.

The EECC has singled out citizen connectivity as a key objective for the EU, since it is instrumental in
guaranteeing freedom of expression, pluralism, democracy, culture, social cohesion and even safety.

The EECC also adopts a broader definition of ECS to regulate services delivered via internet (known as “overthe-top” or OTT services). ECS now includes internet access services, interpersonal communications services and
service consisting wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals.

The EECC also provides for strategic planning and coordination of a radio spectrum policy as well as for effective
management of radio spectrum by the EU Member States.

Finally, national regulation authorities are responsible for ensuring access, interconnection, and the interoperability of services. Consequently, and under certain circumstances, they can impose on undertakings
obligations such as interconnecting networks, ensuring the inter-operability of their services and granting physical
access to their infrastructure. EU Member States were required to enact the EECC into their national laws by
December 21, 2020. As of the date hereof, Portugal has not enacted the EECC into its national laws.

**_The legal status of the Group’s network is complex and in certain cases subject to challenges or renewals._**

The legal status of the Group’s network is complex and the network is mainly governed by public law, which
could affect the predictability of the Group’s rights over its network. For a description of the legal status of the
Group’s cable network. See “Regulation”.

The Group’s telecommunications network is essentially composed of the physical infrastructure (conduits,
network head-ends, switches and radio frequency stations) in which telecommunications (mainly cable)
equipment is installed. These components of the Group’s network are subject to different legal regimes. As the
Group does not own certain land where such physical infrastructures are located and infrastructure is established
on public or private property, it has entered into concessions, rights-of-way, leases or even IRUs with the owners
of the land. In order to establish a substantial part of its telecommunications network and of its wireless network,
the Group has thus entered into public and private property occupancy agreements with public and private entities
or holds public property occupancy permits. Under these agreements or permits, the Group may install its network
equipment along roads, highways, railways or canals, for example. No transfer of ownership takes place within
this framework.

Such agreements are entered into for terms that vary greatly, from 3 to 25 years. The Group does not have any
right to renewal of such agreements, although the agreements with the shortest terms generally provide for tacit
renewal. The Group’s occupancy of public property, as is the case for all occupants of public property, is always
precarious and subject to considerations beyond the Group’s control. The public entities with which the Group
has entered into these agreements or that have issued permits to it can thus at any time terminate these public
property occupancy agreements for misconduct or for reasons of public interest and some of the agreements even
exclude any compensation in such case.

If the Group fails to obtain such renewal, the company involved would be obliged, upon expiration of these
agreements, (i) to return the site to its original condition upon the demand of the manager or owner of the public
property involved and/or (ii) to transfer to the latter, in certain cases for the payment of compensation and in
certain cases free of charge, ownership of the facilities established on the property involved.

If the Group loses all or part of the rights relating to its network, it could have a material adverse effect on the
business, financial position, results of operations or outlook of the Group.

**_Burdensome regulation in an open market may put PT Portugal at a disadvantage to its competitors and could_**
**_adversely affect its business._**

The Portuguese electronic communications sector is fully open to competition. However, many regulatory
restrictions and obligations are still imposed on PT OpCo. On October 9, 2014, the EC adopted a new European
Relevant Markets Recommendation that replaced the 2007 Recommendation and further reduced the number of
relevant markets subject to ex-ante regulation. ANACOM has reanalyzed the retail and wholesale markets
identifying which markets are still relevant for regulatory intervention and which electronic communications
operators and service providers have significant market power in those markets. The decisions relating to the
conclusions of the analysis of markets 3a-3b/2014 (wholesale local and central access at a fixed location) and
4/2014 (wholesale high-quality access at a fixed location) were issued in March 2017 and June 2016, respectively.
ANACOM decided not to impose regulatory obligations on PT OpCo’s fiber network, concluding that they would
not be proportional. ANACOM’s latest decisions regarding the revision of markets 1/2014 (FTR), 2/2014 (MTR)
and 2/2007 (for fixed call origination under the previous recommendation) were issued in October 2018, June
2018 and October 2018, respectively.

ANACOM has reanalyzed the markets defined under the European Relevant Market Recommendation and issued
findings that PT OpCo had significant market power in these markets, namely the wholesale market for call


-----

termination on individual public telephone networks provided at a fixed location, the market for call termination
on individual mobile networks, the markets for wholesale local and central access at a fixed location and the
market for wholesale high-quality access at a fixed location, in which ANACOM included leased lines trunk
segments.

In certain cases, such as in markets 3 and 4, ANACOM has segmented the markets into “C” (competitive) and
“NC” (non-competitive) segments and issued a finding that PT OpCo had significant market power in the noncompetitive segments, imposing remedies to increase competition in those markets. With respect to market 3, the
obligations in ANACOM’s March 2017 decision extended only to the granting of unbundled access to copper
loops, ducts and poles at the national level. However, ANACOM required that the duct and poles offers be made
on an equivalence of inputs (EoI) basis.

ANACOM’s latest decisions in respect of markets 1/2014 (FTR) and 2/2014 (MTR) imposed ex-ante regulatory
obligations on PT OpCo; conversely, in its latest decision on market 2/2007, ANACOM decided to end ex-ante
regulatory obligations in this market, apart from the maintenance of price control obligations, which ended in
March 2020.

Recently, the EC adopted a new European Relevant Markets Recommendation that replaced the 2014
Recommendation (EC’s Recommendation of December 18, 2020 (SWD(2020) 337 final)). ANACOM has not yet
performed any market analysis in the context of the new European Relevant Markets Recommendation.

We receive correspondence from ANACOM from time to time regarding compliance with such and other
regulations. If we are found to be in breach of such regulations, the regulators may impose penalties, fines or
additional obligations on us to rectify such breaches which may have an adverse effect on our business operations.
Remedies imposed by ANACOM may also require PT OpCo to provide services in certain markets or geographic
regions or to make investments that it would otherwise not choose to make. In addition, PT OpCo incurred, and
may still have to incur, expenses to adapt its operations to changing regulatory requirements and to ensure
regulatory compliance. The resources that may be required to fulfill our regulatory obligations in Portugal could
adversely affect our ability to compete.

**_We can only operate our business for as long as we have licenses from the relevant authorities in the_**
**_jurisdictions in which we operate and we may not be able to obtain, retain or review the licenses and_**
**_authorizations necessary for conducting our activities._**

We are required to hold licenses, franchises, permits and similar authorizations to own and operate our networks
and to broadcast our signal to our customers. These authorizations generally require that we comply with
applicable laws and regulations, meet certain solvency requirements and maintain minimum levels of service.
Should we fail to comply with these, we may be subject to financial penalties from the relevant authorities and
there may also be a risk that licenses could be partially or totally withdrawn. The imposition of fines and/or the
withdrawal of licenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition
and prevent us from conducting our business. In addition, such authorizations are generally granted for fixed terms
and must be periodically renewed. The procedure for obtaining or renewing these licenses can be long and costly
and authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition for renewal. In addition, these
licenses may not be obtainable or renewable in a timely manner or at all. In some instances, such authorizations
have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating
agreements or without an authorization while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities.
Should we not be able to obtain or renew the licenses needed to operate or develop our business in a timely fashion,
our ability to realize our strategic objectives may be compromised. In certain cases our mobile licenses require us
to comply with certain obligations (population coverage, sharing in certain areas, national roaming) and we may
suffer adverse consequences if we are not able to comply with these obligations. In certain countries, we have
provided significant bank guarantees to guarantee our performance under our licenses. If we are found to be in
material breach of our licenses, the guarantees may be forfeited and our licenses may be revoked.

In the Dominican Republic, Altice Dominicana was awarded a concession and is licensed to provide
telecommunications services. Altice Dominicana’s concession was originally granted under a concession
agreement with the Dominican State in 1996 and was due to expire on August 1, 2015. Altice Dominicana
presented a formal renewal request to Indotel on April 27, 2015. This concession was de facto renewed, as all of
the criteria for renewal were met by Altice Dominicana. In addition, Altice Dominicana currently holds a number
of frequency license certificates issued by Indotel. These licenses have also been de facto renewed, as all of the
criteria for renewal were met by Altice Dominicana. Indotel called for a renegotiation of our concession agreement


-----

in the first quarter of 2021 and negotiations are ongoing. As per the concession agreement, concessions can be
terminated by Altice Dominicana, or an agreement between Altice Dominicana and Indotel in the event of
bankruptcy, or upon Altice Dominicana being found guilty of committing multiple grave faults (as defined in the
agreement). We make no assurances that our concession or licenses will continue to be renewed in the future.
Furthermore, certain regulatory approvals, such as new build permits, may be required for Altice Dominicana to
operate antenna sites with other frequencies/frequency bands, in particular where the shift is made from a higher
frequency band (e.g. 1800 MHz) to a lower frequency band (e.g. 900 MHz). To the extent that Altice Dominicana
seeks to operate antenna sites with other frequencies/frequency bands in the future, failure to obtain such
regulatory approvals could have a negative impact on the coverage of its network. If Indotel does not continue to
renew Altice Dominicana’s concession or frequency licenses or if Altice Dominicana fails to obtain any regulatory
approvals that are required, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
adversely affected.

The acquisition of licenses also represents a high cost, the timing of which varies depending on when the
frequencies involved are auctioned. Furthermore, this cost could rise due to strong competitive pressure in the
telecommunications field. If we fail to obtain or retain, in a timely manner, the licenses necessary for performing,
continuing or developing our activities, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives could be subjected to
alteration. In addition, we may fail to be awarded the desired licenses, which could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial position, results of operations or outlook.

For further information on the licenses and authorizations necessary for performance of the Group’s activities, see
“Regulation”.

**_Altice Dominicana’s activities may be affected by Indotel’s decisions regarding the granting, amendment or_**
**_renewal of frequency licenses._**

Altice Dominicana’s activities as a mobile network operator in the Dominican Republic are subject to regulation
and supervision by various Dominican authorities, in particular Indotel. Since 2010, the Executive Power issued
Decree 520-11 and Indotel has issued a series of resolutions in order to implement the National Frequency
Allocation Plan (“PNAF”), the objective of which is to reorganize the radio spectrum in the Dominican Republic
and make more bands available for operators to provide mobile services. As a result of the PNAF, Altice
Dominicana has in the past migrated, and may in the future be required to migrate from one frequency to another
allocated to it by Indotel, which may result in disputes among the various telecom operators as to spectrum
entitlement rights relating to the migrated bands. On January 23, 2019, Indotel ordered the beginning of a public
consultation process to amend the PNAF.

On March 6, 2019, Indotel issued a Resolution (No. 013-19) ordering the reorganization of frequency allocations
allocating 3460-3490 MHz to Altice Dominicana. Subsequently, on May 1, 2019, Indotel issued Resolution No.
031-19 whereby it opens the public consultation for the special procedures applicable to the modification of the
PNAF. The modifications to the PNAF were approved by Indotel pursuant to Resolution No. 055-19, which was
approved by way of a Presidential Decree on March 4, 2020. As of February 9, 2021, an auction of spectrum was
launched to assign frequencies in the 700 MHz and 3.6 GHz band in order to promote the launch of 5G services,
which is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2021.

**_We may incur significant costs to comply with city planning laws._**

We are subject to planning laws when we upgrade or expand our networks. In particular, our current installation
of the UMTS/LTE network in Israel is subject to compliance with the National Zoning Plan 36 (TAMA 36) and
the directives issued thereunder, which are aimed at reducing the danger of radiation and the damage to the
environment. The cost of complying with TAMA 36 can be substantial and there is currently a regulatory process
underway to amend TAMA 36 which would place substantial limitations and further increase the cost of erecting
our UMTS/LTE network. In addition, the local loop of our networks is generally located aboveground. Local
municipal governments generally have the authority to require us to move these network lines underground.
Usually, we are able to coordinate with other utility suppliers to share the costs associated with moving lines
underground but no assurance can be given that we will always be able to do so. Nevertheless, the costs of
complying with municipal orders can be substantial and may not be subsidized by such municipal government,
which may require us to incur significant costs in the future.

**_We have had difficulties obtaining some of the building and environmental permits required for the erection_**
**_and operation of our mobile network sites in Israel. These difficulties could have an adverse effect on the_**
**_coverage, quality and capacity of our mobile network._**

Our ability to maintain and improve the extent, quality and capacity of our mobile network coverage in Israel
depends in part on our ability to obtain appropriate sites and approvals to install our mobile network infrastructure,
including mobile network sites. The erection and operation of most of these mobile network sites require building
permits from local or regional planning and building authorities, as well as a number of additional permits from
other governmental and regulatory authorities. In addition, as part of our UMTS/LTE network build-out, we are
erecting additional mobile network sites and making modifications to our existing mobile network sites for which
we may be required to obtain new consents and approvals.

For the reasons described in further detail below, we have had difficulties obtaining some of the building permits
required for the erection and operation of our mobile network sites.

In addition, as we seek to improve the range and quality of our mobile telephony services, we need to further
expand our mobile network, and difficulties in obtaining required permits may delay, increase costs or prevent us
from achieving these goals in full. Our inability to resolve these issues in a timely manner could also prevent us
from achieving or maintaining the mobile network coverage and quality requirements contained in our license.

Since June 2002, following the approval of TAMA 36, which regulates network site construction and operation,
building permits for our mobile network sites (where required) have been issued in reliance on TAMA 36.

We have set up several hundred small communications devices, called wireless access devices, pursuant to a
provision in the Planning and Construction Law, which exempts such devices from the need to obtain a building
permit. A claim was raised that the exemption does not apply to mobile communications devices and the matter
reached first instance courts a number of times, resulting in conflicting decisions. In May 2008, a district court
ruling adopted the position that the exemption does not apply to wireless access devices. The mobile telephone
operators filed a request to appeal this ruling to the Supreme Court. In May 2008, the Israeli Attorney General
filed an opinion regarding this matter stating that the exemption applies to wireless radio access devices under
certain conditions. Subsequently, two petitions were filed with the High Court of Justice in opposition to the Israeli
Attorney General’s opinion.

In September 2010, adopting the position of the Israeli Attorney General, the Israeli Supreme Court issued an
interim order prohibiting further construction of radio access devices for mobile networks in reliance on the
exemption mentioned above. In September 2011, the Supreme Court permitted HOT Mobile and Golan Telecom
to use the exemption in order to erect their new UMTS networks until December 31, 2013, provided, however,
that no more than 40% of the facilities that the operator erects are within the jurisdiction of any municipality, an
affidavit is submitted in advance to the municipality’s engineer and the safety zone does not exceed four meters
and does not deviate from the boundaries of the lot. On August 28, 2013, we submitted a formal request with the
Israeli Supreme Court, requesting a renewal of the exemption. On September 30, 2013, we received a response
from the Supreme Court stating that they had requested a formal reply from the state on this subject matter. On
October 1, 2013, the Israeli Supreme Court passed a decree nisi in relation to the petition to which the State filed
a response on December 17, 2013, requesting a perpetual injunction to prevent the erecting of access network
devices until legislation was put in place by the Israeli Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Communication to
regulate this matter. In its response, the State further claimed that the exemption relating to the erecting of access
network devices for HOT Mobile and Golan Telecom should only be valid until June 30, 2014. The Supreme
Court has not passed judgment on this, however, and until a final decision has been passed by the Supreme Court,
HOT Mobile will be allowed to continue the deployment of its UMTS/LTE network. In March 2016, the Supreme
Court permitted HOT Mobile and Partner to make several adjustments to their existing access devices in order to
enable the companies to operate their joint network. On December 23, 2018, the Supreme Court gave a verdict
rejecting the appeal, due to new bylaws issued by the Minister of Interior Affairs, regulating the conditions for
exemptions granted for construction of radio access devices for mobile networks.

Further, the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection notified us of a new condition for all of our 3G/4G
mobile network site operation permits, according to which we must install systems software (provided by the
Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection) that continuously monitors and reports the level of power created
in real time from the operation of our 3G/4G mobile network sites (the “Monitoring System”). Since May 2012,
we started erecting our new UMTS/LTE cell sites according to construction permits received in November 2011.
We have also made practical examinations to all our new UMTS/LTE cell sites. All of the examinations showed


-----

that our new UMTS/LTE cell sites comply with the safety standard determined by the Israeli Ministry of
Environmental Protection. As of August 2012, we began to apply requests for operation permits to our sites to the
Commissioner. We also applied to the Commissioner for extended time to connect to the monitoring system. As
of November 2012, we started receiving operation permits, which are subject to the demand to connect to the
monitoring system no later than February 5, 2013. On February 4, 2013, we were notified by the Israeli Ministry
of Environmental Protection that we have complied with all of its requirements for connecting to the monitoring
system. Our mobile network has since been transferred to, and is currently the responsibility of, PHI. See
“Description of Our Business—Significant Contracts—Israel—Mobile Network Sharing Agreement with Partner
_in Israel” for more information._

We believe that all of the antennas that we operate comply with the conditions of the safety permits that we were
granted by the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection. However, if our antennas are found to not meet the
conditions of the permits granted to us and the maximum permitted power, the Israeli Ministry of Environmental
Protection may revoke existing permits, which would require us to dismantle existing mobile network sites. As a
result, our network capacity and coverage would be negatively impacted, which could have an adverse effect on
our revenue and results of operations.

**_We may be required to indemnify certain local planning and building committees in Israel with respect to_**
**_claims against them._**

In Israel, under the Planning and Building Law, 1965, local planning committees may be held liable for the
depreciation of the value of nearby properties as a result of approving a building plan. Under the Non-Ionizing
Radiation Law, 2006, the National Council for Planning and Building requires indemnification undertakings from
mobile companies as a precondition for obtaining a building permit for new or existing mobile network sites. The
National Council has decided that until the Plan is amended to reflect a different indemnification amount, mobile
companies will be required to undertake to indemnify the committees in full against all losses resulting from
claims against a committee for reductions in property values as a result of granting a permit to the mobile network
site. On June 1, 2010, the National Council for Planning and Building approved the National Building Plan No.
36/A/1 version that incorporates all of the amendments to the Plan (the “Amended Plan”). The Amended Plan is
subject to government approval in accordance with the Planning and Building Law.

We have several indemnification letters outstanding to local planning and building committees, although no claims
have been filed against us under such letters. Calls upon our indemnification letters may have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

In 2007, the Israeli Ministry of Interior Affairs extended the limitation period within which depreciation claims
may be brought under the Planning and Building Law from three years from approval of the building plan to the
later of (i) one year from receiving a building permit for a mobile network site under the Plan and (ii) six months
from the construction of a mobile network site. The Israeli Ministry retains the general authority to extend such
period further. This extension of the limitation period increases our potential exposure to depreciation claims.

**_Portugal Telecom SGPS, S.A., the former parent of PT Portugal, is subject to an ongoing investigation by the_**
**_Central Department of Penal Investigation and Action relating to purchase of commercial paper issued by Rio_**
**_Forte Investments S.A._**

There is an ongoing investigation by the Central Department of Penal Investigation and Action (“Departamento
**_Central de Investigação e Ação Penal”) involving Portugal Telecom SGPS, S.A., which is not a Group company,_**
related to the purchase by PT International Finance BV and PT Portugal (subsidiaries of Portugal Telecom SGPS,
S.A. at the date of the purchase) of certain commercial paper issued by Rio Forte Investments S.A. (the “Rio
**Forte Investigation”). In connection with this process, on January 6, 2015, investigators searched the Lisbon**
offices of Portugal Telecom SGPS, S.A. The Rio Forte Investigation concerns, among other things, suspicion of
aggravated fraud (“burla qualificada”). According to the Portuguese media, in September 2017, part of the Rio
Forte Investigation was joined to another investigation publicly known as “Operação Marquês”, which involves,
_inter alia, a former Portuguese Prime Minister and two former directors of Portugal Telecom SGPS, S.A. Based_
on public statements by Portugal Telecom SGPS, S.A., they intend to cooperate fully with the authorities. As we
did not control PT Portugal during the period to which the Rio Forte Investigation relates, we have very limited
information with respect to the facts and circumstances surrounding the subject matter of the Rio Forte
Investigation. In addition, because the Rio Forte Investigation is non-public, we do not know who is being
investigated or if any PT Portugal employees are the subject of the Rio Forte Investigation. Oi S.A. has warranted
in the PT Portugal Acquisition Agreement that, upon closing of the PT Portugal Acquisition, neither PT Portugal


-----

nor any of its subsidiaries would be bound by any ongoing obligation towards Portugal Telecom SGPS, S.A. in
connection with the commercial paper of Rio Forte Investments S.A. In addition, the PT Portugal Acquisition
Agreement contains certain undertakings regarding indemnity of PT Portugal by Oi S.A. for certain adverse
consequences which may have been or may be incurred by PT Portugal as a result of the purchase, holding or
transfer of the Rio Forte Investments S.A. commercial paper. We intend to assess any risk of liability under
applicable bribery and corruption laws, understand if there has been any historic misconduct which involved PT
Portugal and take any remedial measures we deem necessary. We cannot assure you that additional information
will not come to light which may materially and adversely affect the value of our investment in PT Portugal or
may expose any employees of PT Portugal to liability, sanctions or penalties by the authorities conducting the Rio
Forte Investigation. If any such new information comes to light or if a member of management of PT Portugal is
found liable and/or subjected to sanctions or penalties, this may have a material adverse effect on the operations
of PT Portugal and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is subject to the risk of litigation in the event of defective software or a claim by a third party as to_**
**_software ownership._**

In contrast to more traditional licenses of standard (so-called “proprietary”) software, users of open source
software (“OSS”) are generally permitted by the licensor to access, copy, modify and distribute the underlying
source code. Such broad rights (such as in the GNU General Public License) are usually subject to the requirement
that users not place any additional restrictions on access to the source code in any onward distribution of the
software, and that such onward licensing be on the original license terms.

OSS is commonly viewed as having two major risks. First, the OSS license usually also covers onward
distributions of derivative works (based on the original OSS), with the result that proprietary software integrated
with the OSS becomes “infected” and the entire integrated software program (OSS and proprietary software
components) is covered by the OSS license. One notable result of this is that the publisher or distributor of the
derivative work would have to make available the source code of the entire work, including the proprietary
software portions. The second commonly viewed risk is that OSS software is usually licensed “as is” without any
contractual warranties.

As a result, the Group would bear the risks in the event of defects with any OSS that it utilizes in its products and
services without necessarily having any contractual recourse. Further, if the Group integrates OSS into any of the
software that it publishes or distributes, then our use of OSS could have an impact on the ownership of the
intellectual property in such software, particularly in terms of exclusivity, as the refusal to disclose any
modifications made could be characterized as an infringement of the OSS license. Moreover, we cannot rule out
any risk of a request for disclosure or the request by a third party to access the modifications of the source code
performed on such software. This situation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations or outlook.

**_We may be held liable for the content hosted on our respective infrastructures or transmitted by our networks._**

In our capacity as an internet and/or mobile service provider and host, we could be held liable for claims due to
the content hosted on our infrastructures or transmitted by its networks (specifically in connection with
infringements in terms of press, invasion of privacy and breach of copyright) and thus face significant defense
costs, even if its liability was ultimately not proven (since internet access providers and hosts are covered by a
limited exemption from liability scheme). The existence of such claims could also harm our reputation.

**Risks Relating to Our Employees and Management, Majority Principal Shareholder and Related Parties**

**_The loss of certain key executives and personnel, failure to apply the necessary managerial and operational_**
**_resources to our growing business or failure to sustain a good working relationship with employee_**
**_representatives, including workers’ unions, could harm our business._**

We depend on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key personnel and, in particular,
Mr. Patrick Drahi, who was President of the Board at Altice Europe before its dissolution on July 9, 2021 and is
our principal shareholder.

There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining their services or that we would be successful in
hiring and training suitable replacements without undue costs or delays. As a result, the loss of the support of our
founder and controlling shareholder (including the allocation of his time to any other business interests) or any of


-----

these key executives and employees could cause disruptions in our business operations, which could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to apply the necessary
managerial and operational resources to our growing business and any weaknesses in our operational and financial
systems or managerial controls and procedures may impact our ability to produce reliable financial statements and
may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In our business, we rely on sales forces and call center employees to interface with the major part of our customers.
Their reliability is key, as is our relationship with employee representatives. Some of our employees currently
belong to organized unions and works councils, and there can be no assurance that more employees will not form
or join unions in the future. An increase in the number of our unionized employees could lead to an increased
likelihood of strikes, work stoppages and other industrial actions. In addition, we also face the risk of strikes called
by employees of our key suppliers of materials or services as well as our installation providers, which could result
in interruptions in the performance of our services. We cannot predict the extent to which future labor disputes or
disturbance could disrupt our operations, cause reputational or financial harm or make it more difficult to operate
our businesses.

**_The interests of our controlling shareholder may differ from the interests of the holders of the Notes._**

The interests of the controlling shareholder of the Issuer, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests
as holders of the Notes. Following the consummation of the Take-Private Transaction, and on the date of this
Offering Memorandum, Next Private owns indirectly 92.8% shares of Altice International and the Issuer. When
business opportunities, or risks and risk allocation arise, the interests of Next Private may be different from, or in
conflict with, the Group’s interests on a standalone basis. Next Private may allocate certain of its risks to the Issuer
or the Group and the Issuer cannot assure you that Next Private will permit the Group to pursue certain business
opportunities. As a result of its controlling position, Next Private has, directly or indirectly, the power, among
other things, to affect the Group’s legal and capital structure and day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to
elect and change the Group’s management and to approve any other changes to the Group’s strategy, structure
and operations. A change of strategy or management adversely affecting the Group’s operations could indirectly
have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its obligations under the Notes. In addition, Next Private has,
directly or indirectly, the power to control the Group’s abilities to enter into any corporate transaction and prevent
any transaction that requires the approval of the shareholders, regardless of whether the holders of the Notes
believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. Next Private could exercise such power to cause
us to incur additional indebtedness or sell certain material assets, in each case, so long as the Group’s debt
instruments and the Intercreditor Agreement permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the
Group’s debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce our ability to generate revenues, each
of which could adversely affect the holders of the Notes.

Furthermore, certain other subsidiaries of Altice Europe also have substantial indebtedness. To the extent
permitted by the Indenture and other agreements governing the indebtedness of the Group, the Board of Directors
of the Issuer may (in compliance with their fiduciary duties as directors of a public company) vote to distribute
cash to its shareholders to allow them to service and repay such indebtedness or for other purposes.

Next Private and its affiliates are in the business of making investments in telecommunications companies and
may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly and indirectly with the Group,
or with which it conducts business. Next Private and its affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that
may be complementary to the business of the Group and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be
available to the Group.

The Group also receives certain advisory and management services from Altice Europe and members of its
management team and receives additional services from Altice Europe and its affiliates as described under
“Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” and may receive additional services or enter into other
related party transactions in the future. The Group may be required to pay management fees, franchise fees,
licensing fees or other similar compensation to Altice Europe (including members of its management team) and
its affiliates for such services. In addition, the Group may also be required to reimburse Altice Europe and its
affiliates for all expenses incurred on the Group’s behalf.

You should consider that the interests of Next Private and its affiliates may differ from yours in material respects.
See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions”.

**_Possible labor conflicts could disrupt our activities, affect our image or make the operation of our facilities_**
**_more costly._**

In the year ended December 31, 2020, we had approximately 14,643 full time employees, some of whom are
union members. We may have to negotiate at length with unions and works councils, and may suffer strikes,
labor conflicts, work stoppages and other labor action, and we may also encounter difficulties in attracting and
###### keeping staff due to local or general strikes. Strikes and other labor action, as well as the negotiating of new
collective bargaining agreements or wage negotiations, could disrupt our activities and have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

We are active in very competitive markets that are constantly evolving, thus requiring our constant adaptation to,
anticipation and adoption of new operational practices and technologies to preserve our competitiveness and our
efficiency. This entails regular changes in organizations, which requires adaptation on the part of the human
resources involved. In particular, this process demands an ability to mobilize skills and motivate and orient teams
toward our objectives. As a result, our activities may sometimes be affected by a deterioration of the labor relations
with our employees, staff representative bodies or labor unions. In such instances, certain of our entities would
have to consult their staff representative bodies, or will have to do so, in order to successfully execute our current
###### and future projects, which is likely to slow down the performance of certain operations.

We also face the risk of strikes called by employees of our main suppliers of equipment or services, as well as our
facility providers, the latter generally organized in regional unions, which could lead to interruptions in our
services. We cannot guarantee that labor conflicts or difficulties in retaining our staff will not have a material
adverse effect our business and, potentially, our results of operations and our financial position.

From time to time, we have undertaken a simplification of our organization and implemented certain operating
synergies measures. These transformation plans involve numerous situations of internal mobility, which may
result in employee dissatisfaction or loss of personnel. In addition, from time to time, we have optimized our
workforce and executed a voluntary retirement plans taken up by a significant number of employees, mainly in
support functions. See “—Risks Relating to Our Business, Technology and Competition—We have significant
_post-retirement benefit and healthcare obligations, the payment of which may have an adverse effect on our_
_business and, therefore, our ability to service our debt obligations”._

There can be no assurance that these measures will generate the expected efficiencies or benefits. As a result of
these initiatives, there can be no guarantee that we will not experience employee dissatisfaction or personnel loss
in the future.

**Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure**

**_The Issuer is a special purpose vehicle company with limited assets other than its interests in certain proceeds_**
**_loans and is dependent upon cash from Altice International and its subsidiaries to meet its obligations under_**
**_the Notes._**

The Issuer is a special purpose vehicle company with no business or revenue generating operations of its own
(other than the incurrence of indebtedness and entry into intercompany proceeds loans with the proceeds thereof).
The only significant assets of the Issuer on the Issue Date will consist of cash in its bank accounts and receivables
under certain proceeds loans made to Altice Holdings, Cool Holding, Hadaros and HOT with proceeds of
indebtedness. As such, the Issuer will be wholly dependent upon payments under such proceeds loans and other
payment from members of the Group in order to service its debt obligations under the Notes. Furthermore, the
Indenture will prohibit and the Altice Finco 2028 Notes Indenture and the Altice Financing Indentures prohibit
the Issuer from engaging in any activities other than certain limited activities. See “Description of Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Issuer Activities”._

The ability of the Issuer to make payments under the Notes will depend upon the Group’s cash flows and earnings
which, in turn, will be affected by all of the factors discussed in these “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. Furthermore, the payment of dividends and the making, or repayment, of loans and advances to
the Issuer by Altice International’s subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions. Existing debt of certain of these
subsidiaries prohibits or restricts, and future debt of such subsidiaries may prohibit or restrict, the payment of
dividends or the making, or repayment, of loans or advances to the Issuer or its parent entities. In addition, the
ability of any of Altice International’s direct or indirect subsidiaries to make certain distributions may be limited
by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the subsidiaries are organized or located, including financial


-----

assistance rules, corporate benefit laws, requirements that dividends must be paid out of reserves available for
distribution and other legal restrictions which, if violated, might require the recipient to refund unlawful payments.

Although the Indenture will, and the Altice Financing Notes, the Altice Financing Term Loans, the Altice
Financing Revolving Credit Facilities, the 2017 Altice Financing Guarantee Facility, the Altice Finco 2028 Notes,
and other debt instruments of Altice International and its subsidiaries do limit the ability of Altice International’s
subsidiaries to enter into future consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and make other payments
to the Issuer, there are significant qualifications and exceptions to these limitations. We cannot assure you that
arrangements with Altice International’s subsidiaries and the funding permitted by the agreements governing
existing and future indebtedness of Altice International’s subsidiaries will provide the Issuer, Altice International
or Altice Holdings, Cool Holding, Hadaros and HOT, as applicable, with sufficient dividends, distributions or
loans to fund payments under the relevant proceeds loans and or the Notes, when due. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes”._

**_Altice International and certain of the other Guarantors are holding companies and conduct no business of_**
**_their own and will depend on payments from their direct and indirect subsidiaries to provide them with funds_**
**_to meet their obligations under the Guarantees._**

Each of Altice International, Cool Holding, Hadaros, Altice Holdings, Altice West Europe, Altice Caribbean,
Altice Portugal and Altice Bahamas is a holding company and conducts no business operations of its own and
none of them has significant assets other than the shares it holds in its subsidiaries.

The ability of the direct or indirect subsidiaries of these Guarantors to pay dividends or to make other payments
or advances to them will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual
restrictions to which they may be or may become subject and, in some cases, receipt of such payments or advances
may be subject to onerous tax consequences. See “—The granting of the Guarantees and the HOT Proceeds Note
_Guarantees and security interests under the Senior Secured Collateral by Cool Holding, Hadaros and HOT may_
_be considered a “distribution” under Israeli law”._

Each of Cool Holding and Hadaros has no significant assets other than the shares it holds in HOT. We cannot
assure you that HOT will report net profit in future years, which in light of legal requirements in Israel relating to
the distribution of dividends, may impact its ability to make distributions to Cool Holding and/or Hadaros and in
turn impact the ability of the Issuer to make payments of principal and interest on the Notes. Under Israeli laws,
a company may only make distributions up to the amount of the greater of (i) its retained earnings and (ii) its
cumulative net income over the preceding eight quarters (and provided that it meets the solvency test (as defined
under Israeli law)), which will be reduced by the amount of distributions already made to the extent not already
reflected in, the calculation of distributable profits. Likewise, the Portuguese operating subsidiaries held, directly
or indirectly, by Altice Portugal, may only make distributions out of the amount of its net assets that exceeds the
sum of share capital and undistributable reserves (if any).

There can be no assurance that arrangements with Altice International’s, Cool Holding’s, Hadaros’, Altice
Holdings’, Altice West Europe’s, Altice Caribbean’s, Altice Portugal’s and Altice Bahamas’ direct and indirect
subsidiaries and the funding permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of such
subsidiaries will provide Altice International, Cool Holding, Hadaros, Altice Holdings, Altice West Europe, Altice
Caribbean, Altice Portugal and Altice Bahamas, as applicable, with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to
fund payments under their respective Guarantees, and, in turn, fund payments by the Issuer under the Notes, when
due.

**_Your right to receive payments under the Notes may be structurally or effectively subordinated to the claims of_**
**_certain existing and future creditors of Altice International’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes._**

None of Altice International’s subsidiaries, except the Guarantors, will guarantee the Notes. Generally, claims of
creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors and claims of preference shareholders (if any)
of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of
creditors of its parent entity, including claims by the holders of the Notes under the Guarantees. In the event of
any foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation, administration, reorganization or other insolvency or
bankruptcy proceeding of any non-Guarantor subsidiary, holders of their debt (including any intercompany loans
to such subsidiaries) and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets
of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes


-----

and the Guarantees will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference
shareholders (if any) of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

Holders of the Notes will have the indirect benefit of the security granted to secure the HOT Proceeds Notes and
the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees which will be pledged by the Issuer for the benefit of holders of the Notes.
The obligations under the HOT Proceeds Notes and the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees will rank senior in right
of payment to all other unsecured obligations of HOT and the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantors up to the lesser of
the value of the assets securing the HOT Proceeds Notes and the amount of obligations outstanding thereunder.
To the extent the amounts outstanding under the HOT Proceeds Notes exceed the value of the assets securing it,
such excess amounts will rank pari passu in right of payment with all other senior unsecured obligations of HOT
and the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantors, including the claims of any trade creditors. With respect to amounts in
excess of the amount outstanding under the HOT Proceeds Notes, the Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally
subordinated to the obligations of HOT and its subsidiaries, including with respect to the claims of any trade
creditors.

HOT Mobile and its subsidiary are not guarantors of the HOT Proceeds Notes and will not be guarantors of the
Notes and, as a result, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations, including with respect to
claims of trade creditors, of HOT Mobile and its subsidiary, and any other subsidiary of HOT that does not
guarantee the HOT Proceeds Notes or the Notes.

The non-Guarantor subsidiaries may also be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, further
increasing the risks associated with leverage. If any of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries incur additional
indebtedness, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ahead of you in any proceeds distributed in
connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of such nonGuarantor subsidiaries.

**_The value of the Senior Secured Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and_**
**_such Senior Secured Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, which may be time_**
**_consuming and cumbersome, and certain Senior Secured Collateral and Guarantees will be limited to a_**
**_specified maximum amount._**

In the event of foreclosure on the Senior Secured Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the Senior Secured
Collateral that secures the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. The value of the
Senior Secured Collateral and the amounts to be received upon a sale of such Senior Secured Collateral will
depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell any or all of Altice International’s
subsidiaries’ shares in an ordinary sale and the availability of buyers. Although the Notes will indirectly benefit
from collateral securing certain intercompany debt (including collateral security the HOT Proceeds Notes) through
the assignment of such intercompany debt, the Notes will not have a direct benefit of such collateral and the
Security Agent will be unable to enforce over such collateral except if an event of default has occurred and is
continuing under the relevant intercompany debt. See “—The guarantees of, and the collateral securing, certain
_intercompany debt that is pledged to secure our Senior Secured Debt, including the Notes and Guarantees thereof,_
_will not directly secure the Notes”._

Certain Senior Secured Collateral and Guarantees will be limited to an agreed maximum amount. Under the
Aggregate Portuguese Security and Guarantee Limit, the maximum aggregate amount of obligations
(i) guaranteed by Altice Portugal and (ii) secured by the pledge over the shares in PT Portugal, which limitation
applies to all indebtedness so guaranteed and/or secured by Altice Portugal on an aggregate basis, is €95 million.
The maximum amount of obligations secured or guaranteed by PT Portugal will be €4,634 million and PT OpCo
€968 million. As a result, these entities will not have a direct obligation to the holders of the Notes once these
limits have been reached, as applicable.

No appraisal of the fair market value of the Senior Secured Collateral has been made in connection with this
offering of Notes. The book value of the Senior Secured Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of
realizable value for such assets. The value of the Senior Secured Collateral could be impaired in the future as a
result of changing economic and market conditions, our failure to successfully implement our business strategy,
competition and other factors. The Senior Secured Collateral may include intangible or other illiquid assets that
by their nature may not have a readily ascertainable market value, whose value to other parties may be less than
its value to us, or may not be readily saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in their liquidation.
In addition, the value of the Senior Secured Collateral may decrease because of obsolescence, impairment or
certain casualty events.


-----

In the event of a liquidation, insolvency, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, the
proceeds from the sale of the Senior Secured Collateral that secures the Notes and the guarantees may not be
sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the
Guarantees. The value of the Senior Secured Collateral and the amount that may be received upon a sale of Senior
Secured Collateral will depend upon many factors including, among others, the condition of the Senior Secured
Collateral and our industry, the ability to sell the Senior Secured Collateral in an orderly sale, market and economic
conditions, whether the business is sold as a going concern, the availability of buyers and other factors. In addition,
the Senior Secured Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market. With respect to any
shares of Altice International’s subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Guarantees, such shares may also
have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, winding up or other similar proceedings
in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares
have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result,
the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of
an enforcement sale.

In addition, courts could limit recoverability with respect to the Senior Secured Collateral if they deem a portion
of the interest claim usurious in violation of applicable public policy. As a result, liquidating the Senior Secured
Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Notes. We cannot
assure you of the value of the Senior Secured Collateral or that the net proceeds received upon a liquidation,
foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding would be sufficient to repay all amounts due on the
Notes. If the proceeds of Senior Secured Collateral were not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the
Notes, then holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Senior Secured
Collateral) would only have an unsecured claim against our remaining assets. See “—It may be difficult to realize
_the value of the Senior Secured Collateral securing the Notes”._

The Senior Secured Collateral also secures the other Senior Secured Debt. The Indenture will also permit the
granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the relevant Senior Secured
Collateral securing the Notes, including in respect of certain future indebtedness. To the extent that holders of
other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy such liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by
the Indenture or the security documents governing the Senior Secured Collateral, such holders or third parties may
have rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Secured Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds
available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes, to the extent such Notes are secured by such Senior Secured
Collateral. Moreover, if the Issuer issues additional Notes under the Indenture or the Altice Financing Indentures,
holders of such additional Notes would benefit from the same Senior Secured Collateral as the holders of the
Notes, thereby diluting the holders’ ability to benefit from the liens on the Senior Secured Collateral securing the
Notes.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of an enforcement of the Senior Secured Collateral
securing the Notes, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Senior Secured Collateral only after
the lenders under the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging
agreements have been repaid in full.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for detailed enforcement mechanisms with respect to the Senior Secured
Collateral. Please see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”.

**_The security interests in the Senior Secured Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly_**
**_to the holders of the Notes and the ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Senior Secured_**
**_Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Senior Secured Collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will
be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. In addition, the security interests in any collateral that secures any
of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries under any secured intercompany debt (including the collateral securing the HOT
Proceeds Notes and the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees) will not be granted directly to the Issuer but will be
granted in favor of the security agent (if any) thereunder. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor
Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the security documents. As a consequence, the
holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests (other than Senior Secured Collateral governed by
Portuguese Law deemed to have been granted directly in favor of the secured creditors) and will not be entitled
to take enforcement action in respect of the Senior Secured Collateral, except through the Security Agent, who


-----

will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the
Security Agent in respect of the Senior Secured Collateral.

The appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law, (i) to the extent that the
designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions, depending
on the type of the security interests. Generally, according to article 2(4) of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5,
2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the “Collateral Act 2005”), a security (financial
collateral) may be provided in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral taker, a fiduciary or a trustee in
order to secure the claims of third party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third party
beneficiaries are determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis à vis third party
beneficiaries of the security, persons acting on behalf of beneficiaries of the security, the fiduciary or the trustee
benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of the security aimed at by such law.

The security documents governing the granting of the Senior Secured Collateral will be governed by the laws of
a number of jurisdictions. Bankruptcy laws could prevent the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes
from repossessing and disposing of the Senior Secured Collateral upon the occurrence of an event of default if a
bankruptcy proceeding is commenced by or against the relevant grantor of such Senior Secured Collateral before
the Security Agent repossesses and disposes of the Senior Secured Collateral. See “—Enforcing your rights as a
_holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or security across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult or provide_
_less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law”._

**_The ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under the Senior Secured Collateral and the Guarantees may_**
**_be limited. Before any amounts are available to repay the Notes, lenders under the 2015 Super Senior Revolving_**
**_Credit Facility and counterparts to certain hedging arrangements will have a right to be repaid with the_**
**_proceeds realized following the enforcement of all or part of the Senior Secured Collateral._**

The obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees are secured by security interests over the Senior Secured
Collateral which also secure our obligations under the Senior Secured Debt and certain hedging arrangements.
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the lenders under the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and
counterparties to certain hedging agreements will have priority over the holders of the Notes with respect to the
proceeds from the enforcement of the Senior Secured Collateral. In addition, the creditors under the 2015 Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging agreements will have priority over any
amounts received from the sale of any assets of the Issuer or the Guarantors pursuant to an insolvency event or
certain other distressed disposals of the Senior Secured Collateral pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. As
such, you may not be able to recover on the Senior Secured Collateral if the claims of the lenders under the 2015
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging agreements are greater than the
proceeds realized from any enforcement of the security interests over the Senior Secured Collateral.

In addition, the Senior Secured Collateral may also secure certain future indebtedness that is permitted to be
incurred under the Indenture and our other existing debt agreements, and certain of that indebtedness may have
similar priority to the proceeds of the enforcement of, or certain distressed disposals of, the Senior Secured
Collateral as described above with respect to the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
certain hedging obligations. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Senior Secured Collateral by any
creditor will, after all obligations under the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain
hedging obligations have been paid from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and other
senior indebtedness secured on such Senior Secured Collateral, including the Altice Financing Notes, the Altice
Financing Term Loans and the Altice Financing Guarantee Facilities.

Our ability to incur additional debt in the future secured on the Senior Secured Collateral may have the effect of
diluting the ratio of the value of such Senior Secured Collateral to the aggregate amount of the obligations secured
by the Senior Secured Collateral. In addition, claims of any secured creditors which are secured by assets that do
not also secure the Notes or the Guarantees will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders
of the Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such
secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

Subject to certain conditions, any security interest in the Senior Secured Collateral will be automatically released
at the time of an enforcement sale of the pledged entity or the assets or shares of any direct or indirect parent entity
of such subsidiary. Following such a sale, the Trustee of the Notes and the holders of the Notes will have no claims
in relation to such entity and its direct and indirect subsidiaries under the Notes or any Guarantee. See “Description
_of Other Indebtedness—The Intercreditor Agreement” for further information._


-----

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Senior Secured Collateral securing the Notes._**

On the Issue Date (or within 30 Business Days after the Issue Date), the holders of the Notes will benefit from
security interests in the Senior Secured Collateral, which includes the Issuer’s rights under certain secured
intercompany debt (including the HOT Proceeds Notes).

The Senior Secured Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal
perfection and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture, the Altice Financing Indentures and/or the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Initial Purchasers have neither analyzed the effect of, nor participated in any
negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections. The existence of
any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely
affect the value of the Senior Secured Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose
on such Senior Secured Collateral. Furthermore, the first-ranking ranking of security interests can be affected by
a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or
recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, before the pledge over the shares and other
material assets of Altice Dominicana will secure the Notes, Indotel will need to approve both the granting of the
security as well as the enforceability of such security. We cannot assure you that such approval will be granted.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Senior Secured Collateral. For example,
the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party, including that of competent regulatory
authorities or courts, to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to
obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when
required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to
foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Senior Secured Collateral may significantly decrease.

Furthermore, enforcement procedures and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in Portugal, Luxembourg, Israel,
the Dominican Republic and the United Kingdom may be materially more complex and time consuming than in
equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. See “—Enforcing your rights as a
_holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or security across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult or provide_
_less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law”. In particular, the enforcement and realization of any security interest_
under the Senior Secured Collateral which is governed by Israeli law will be subject to the supervision of the
Israeli courts or the Israeli Office of Execution of Judgments and their practices. Enforcement and realization of
security interests in Israel is subject to certain mandatory principles. The general rule under Israeli law is that any
enforcement or realization of a fixed pledge or charge or a floating charge is required to be made in accordance
with and subject to a court order, with certain exceptions for collateral deposited with the creditor, collateral with
respect to which the law specifies another manner of realization and collateral which consists of rights. See “—
_Rights of holders of Notes to enforce, secure and realize their rights under the Senior Secured Collateral may be_
_adversely affected in Israeli insolvency proceedings”. Furthermore, enforcement or realization of rights with_
respect to the pledges of the shares of Cool Holding and Hadaros is subject to the prior approval of and supervision
by the Israeli Ministry of Communications and enforcement or realization of rights with respect to the pledges of
the shares of Altice Dominicana is subject to the prior approval of Indotel, in each case which may be time
consuming and cumbersome.

**_Rights in the Senior Secured Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in_**
**_the Senior Secured Collateral._**

Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and its priority
retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security. The liens on the
Senior Secured Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees, as the case may be,
if the Security Agent is not able to or does not take the actions necessary to perfect or maintain the perfection of
any such liens. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Senior Secured
Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, as applicable, or adversely affect the priority of such security
interest in favor of such debt against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim
a security interest in the same Senior Secured Collateral. In addition, applicable law may require that certain
property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such
property and rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will monitor,
or that we will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Senior
Secured Collateral, and that all necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after
acquired collateral. The Security Agent does not have any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional


-----

property or rights that should constitute Senior Secured Collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps to perfect,
any security interest therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the Senior Secured
Collateral or adversely affect the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes and the Guarantees against
third parties including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who may claim a secured interest in any part of
the Senior Secured Collateral.

To the extent that the security interests created by the Security Documents with respect to any Senior Secured
Collateral are not perfected, the Security Agent’s rights will be equal to the rights of general unsecured creditors
in the event of a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Senior Secured_**
**_Collateral and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the_**
**_Security Agent or Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Guarantees of the Guarantors will be released, including in connection with
certain transactions intended to simplify the Group’s corporate structure. See “Description of Notes—The Note
_Guarantees” and “The Offering”. In addition, under various circumstances, the Issuer and the Guarantors will be_
entitled to release the security interests in respect of the Senior Secured Collateral securing the Notes and the
Guarantees.

We will also be permitted to release and/or re-take any lien on any Senior Secured Collateral to the extent
otherwise permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the security documents governing the Senior Secured Collateral,
the Altice Financing Indentures or the Intercreditor Agreement or any additional intercreditor agreement. Such a
release and re-taking of Senior Secured Collateral may give rise to the start of a new hardening period in respect
of the Senior Secured Collateral. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or
representatives or courts could challenge the validity or enforceability of the grant of the Senior Secured Collateral.
Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of the Senior Secured Collateral
and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Notes Security”.

**_We will in most cases have control over the Senior Secured Collateral securing the Notes and the sale or_**
**_disposal of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing such debt._**

The security documents governing the Senior Secured Collateral will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors, as
applicable, to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose
of any income from the Senior Secured Collateral. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture
would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by
the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Senior Secured Collateral, such as selling,
factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Senior Secured Collateral and making ordinary course cash
payments, including repayments of debt. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Senior Secured
Collateral and consequently the amounts payable to you from proceeds of any sale of Senior Secured Collateral
in the case of an enforcement of the liens.

**_The guarantees of, and the collateral securing, certain intercompany debt that is pledged to secure our Senior_**
**_Secured Debt, including the Notes and Guarantees thereof, will not directly secure the Notes._**

The guarantees of, and the collateral securing the HOT Proceeds Notes that is pledged to secure our Senior Secured
Debt, including the Notes and Guarantees thereof, will not directly secure the Notes. Instead, such security
interests are granted in favor of the security agent under the HOT Proceeds Notes or the relevant lender thereunder,
and the first-ranking pledge over such intercompany debt will in turn serve as part of the Senior Secured Collateral
securing the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes. Only the security agent or lender thereunder (as applicable)
will be able to enforce the security interests in the collateral securing the HOT Proceeds Notes in accordance with
its terms, including in certain cases upon the occurrence of an event of default that is continuing under such
intercompany indebtedness. As a result, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Notes, the Trustee
and the holders of the Notes may not have the right to enforce such security interests in the collateral securing
such intercompany indebtedness (including the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral) and will only have the right to
enforce the first-ranking pledge over such intercompany indebtedness. The holders of the Notes must then rely on
the ability of the Issuer to enforce its rights under the HOT Proceeds Notes upon an event of default thereunder
(as applicable) in order to access such collateral. An event of default under the Notes may not result in an event
of default under the HOT Proceeds Notes. Moreover, the borrowers and guarantors under such intercompany
indebtedness will not have any liability to the holders of the Notes in an event of default under the Indenture,


-----

except to the extent they are Guarantors. However, if an event of default occurs and is continuing under the HOT
Proceeds Notes, holders of the Notes will indirectly benefit to the extent the Issuer or a Guarantor is a lender under
or purchaser of the HOT Proceeds Notes. This indirect claim over the collateral securing the HOT Proceeds Notes
could delay or make more costly any realization of such collateral. Furthermore, because the Indenture and the
Notes will be governed by New York law and the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral are governed by the laws of
Israel, realization may be further delayed by court proceedings in multiple jurisdictions. See “Limitation on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests”._

There may be circumstances in which a breach of the covenants under the Indenture does not result in a
corresponding breach under certain of our secured intercompany indebtedness that is pledged to secure the Notes.
In such circumstances, the holders of the Notes would only be entitled to enforce the assignment over such
intercompany indebtedness in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement; however, they would not be entitled
to accelerate such intercompany indebtedness or take enforcement action in respect of the collateral securing such
intercompany indebtedness. In addition, there may be circumstances in which such intercompany indebtedness is
in default and there is not a default outstanding under the Indenture. In such circumstances, the holders of the
Notes and the other creditors secured by the assignment over such intercompany indebtedness would not be
entitled to take any enforcement action with respect to such intercompany indebtedness. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—HOT Proceeds Notes—HOT Proceeds Term Note”._

**_The dual nationality of Cool Holding may impact the ability to enforce the pledges over the share capital of_**
**_Cool Holding._**

Cool Holding is an entity which has a registered office in Luxembourg and a registered office in the State of Israel.
It is registered with both the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register and the Israeli Registrar of Companies
and according to its articles of association its principal place of management and control is Luxembourg. Cool
Holding is therefore subject to both Luxembourg laws and Israeli laws and is deemed to have a dual nationality.

The dual nationality of Cool Holding may impact the ability to enforce the pledges over the share capital of Cool
Holding depending on whether enforcement will be sought under the Luxembourg law pledges or under the Israeli
law pledges, as enforcement formalities and requirements under these laws may differ.

Likewise, there may be limited recognition by a Luxembourg court or an Israeli court of an enforcement of the
pledges of the share capital of Cool Holding when performed in the respective other jurisdiction, because each
court will consider that, in accordance with its own international private law rules, the pledges should have been
enforced in its own jurisdiction and in accordance with its own governing laws, rather than those of the other
jurisdiction. Furthermore, due to the dual nationality of Cool Holding, there may be an uncertainty as to which of
the Luxembourg or the Israeli law pledges it is appropriate to enforce at the time of enforcement.

**_The granting of the Guarantees and the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees and security interests under the Senior_**
**_Secured Collateral by Cool Holding, Hadaros and HOT may be considered a “distribution” under Israeli law._**

The granting of the Guarantees and the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees and security interests under the Senior
Secured Collateral to secure obligations under the Notes, to the extent that no valuable consideration has been
paid to the respective guarantor against the granting of the Guarantees, the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees or the
security interests in the Senior Secured Collateral, as applicable, may be considered as a “distribution” under
Israeli law, and accordingly will be subject to Cool Holding, Hadaros or HOT being able to meet all of its
obligations when they become due (the “Solvency Test”) and certain distributable reserves criteria, as set by
Israeli law. See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—Israel—
_Limitation on Distributions and Fiduciary Duties”. Cool Holding, Hadaros or HOT may apply to a competent_
Israeli court to approve a distribution notwithstanding its non-compliance with the distributable reserves criteria
if it complies with the Solvency Test. However, approval of distributions by an order of a court is subject to
objections that may be raised by other creditors whose interests may be jeopardized by the distribution.

In addition, certain interpretation of the Israeli tax law might suggest the treatment of the Guarantees and the HOT
Proceeds Note Guarantees, as well as any guarantees previously granted by Cool Holding and Hadaros for
obligations of their parent companies, as deemed distributions for purposes of Israeli tax law. If such guarantees
were treated as deemed distributions, this could impose an obligation on Cool Holding, Hadaros and HOT to
withhold Israeli taxes from the amount of such deemed distributions.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or security across multiple jurisdictions_**
**_may prove difficult or provide less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, which is incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.
The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are incorporated under the laws of Portugal, Luxembourg,
Israel and the Dominican Republic. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could
be initiated in any, all or any combination of the above jurisdictions. Such jurisdictions may not be as favorable
to investors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar, and
proceedings in these jurisdictions are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in
greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the
Guarantees and the Senior Secured Collateral will be subject to such bankruptcy, insolvency and administrative
laws and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex,
multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. See “—Each Guarantee will be subject to certain
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its_
_validity and enforceability”._

In addition, in the event that one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors and any future guarantor, if any, or any
other of our subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other
laws of the Issuer and the Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization and location of assets may be materially
different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of
creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the
proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether the law
of any particular jurisdiction should apply, and may adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the
Notes, the Guarantees and the Senior Secured Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may
receive. See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests” with respect
to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above.

**_Each Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or_**
**_subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However,
the Indenture will provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that may be guaranteed by
the relevant Guarantor without, among other things, rendering the relevant Guarantee, as it relates to that
Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law or causing the officers of the
Guarantor to incur personal civil or criminal liability, and enforcement of each such Guarantee would be subject
to certain generally available defenses. See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
_Security Interests”._

Enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Guarantor, or of the security interests in respect thereof, will
be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among
various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) void or
invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the security interests in respect
thereof, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant
Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to
you, typically if the court found that:

- the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder,
delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the
granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that
the relevant Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee;

- the relevant Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit
for the relevant Guarantee and such Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant
Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee; or (iii)
intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

- the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed financial assistance rules or the corporate objects of the Guarantor
or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or


-----

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted
under applicable law.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the
Indenture. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could
limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent”
at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor
was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was
insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to the holders of the Notes constituted preferences,
fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing
law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets;

- the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its
existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or

- it cannot pay its debts as they become due.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee
not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set
aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the
maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which
case the entire liability may be extinguished.

If a court decided that a Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Guarantee,
or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor
and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee
that has not been declared void. In the event that any Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part,
or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively
subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor to the extent of such enforceability or agreed limitation,
and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent
transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts
outstanding under the Notes. See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security
_Interests”._

**_There is uncertainty over the perfection and enforceability of the security interests governed by laws of the_**
**_Dominican Republic_**

The perfection and enforceability of the security interests over the shares and other material assets of Altice
Dominicana granted under the existing security documents governed by the laws of the Dominican Republic (the
“Dominican Republic Security Documents”) to secure the Senior Secured Debt and the Notes is subject to prior
approval of Indotel. There can be no assurance that the approval of Indotel will be received on a timely basis or
at all. Further, as a result of the enactment of Dominican Republic´s Law No. 45-20 on Movable Collateral (“Law
**45-20”), which entered into effect on December 21, 2020, the Dominican Republic adopted new legislation**
governing security over moveable assets. Law 45-20 expressly repealed former legal provisions which governed
the types of securities granted pursuant to the Dominican Republic Security Documents and instead created a new
type of “Moveable Property Security” with its own registration system (Electronic System of Movable Collateral
or SEGM), as well as its own creation and enforcement rules. Currently the SEGM has not been established and
consequently such system is not yet available for registering Moveable Property Security. In light of such
uncertainties, a bill has been introduced in the Dominican Republic Congress which seeks to postpone the entry
into force of Law 45-20 until the year 2023, in order to allow local authorities more time to establish the SEGM
and address the problems created by the entry into force of Law 45-20 (the “Bill”). As a result, we have entered
into amendments to the Dominican Republic Security Documents pursuant to which security interests in the form
of Moveable Property Securities have been created under Law 45-20 and alternatively, in case the Bill is enacted,
under the previously existing legal regime. Notwithstanding such amendments, if the Bill is not enacted into law


-----

and the security interests granted under the Dominican Republic Security Documents are held to be unenforceable
due to the enactment of Law 45-20 and/or the unavailability of the SEGM, the ability of the Security Agent to
realize or foreclose on such Senior Secured Collateral will be adversely impacted and the secured parties’ rights
will be equal to the rights of general unsecured creditors in the event of a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding.

**_We may not be able to obtain enough funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the_**
**_occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) as_**
**_required by the Indenture._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event, the Issuer will be required
to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes (and the Issuer may be required to repay the outstanding borrowings
under the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facility Agreements and/or offer to purchase the Altice Financing
Notes) at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. If a change of control triggering event were to occur, we
cannot assure you that the Issuer would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of
the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in our credit facilities or other then existing contractual obligations
of the Issuer would allow the Issuer to make such required repurchases. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to
such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control triggering event itself
does not. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of
control triggering event may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be
available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control triggering
event occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from repurchasing Notes, we may be required to seek the
consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of Notes or may attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If we do not obtain such consent or refinance such borrowings, the
Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any tendered Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require
third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control triggering event. We
cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase
Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which could, in turn, constitute a default under other
agreements governing our debt. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control”.

The change of control triggering event provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you
protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers,
recapitalizations or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate
events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a
“change of control triggering event” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of
_Notes—Change of Control”, the Indenture does not contain provisions that require us to offer to repurchase or_
redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of “change of control” contained in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of Altice International and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole to any person other than
certain Permitted Holders (as defined in the Indenture). Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting
the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Altice International and its restricted
subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and
whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_We cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell_**
**_the Notes will be limited._**

The Notes will be new securities for which there is no market. We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market that may develop for the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.


-----

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest
rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade
securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar
to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the
market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. It is possible that the
market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a
holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers of the Notes
have advised the Issuer that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes. However, the Initial Purchasers
are not obliged to do so, and they may discontinue any market making activities at any time without notice. As a
result, there is no assurance that an active trading market will develop for the Notes. If no active trading market
develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Exchange._**

Although the Issuer will agree in the Indenture to use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Notes listed on
the Exchange within a reasonable period after the Issue Date, and to maintain such listing as long as the Notes are
outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer is unable to or
can no longer maintain the listing on the Exchange, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the
Exchange, provided that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes
on another recognized stock exchange, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so.
Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Exchange or another
recognized listing exchange for high yield issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved for
listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the
applicable Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary
market.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks._**

The credit ratings assigned to the Notes are an assessment by the relevant rating agencies of the Issuer’s ability to
pay its debts when due, which is, in respect of payment obligations under the Notes, dependent upon the ability
of the obligors under proceeds loans (including Altice Holdings, Cool Holding, Hadaros and HOT) to make
payments to pay their debts when due. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our or the Notes’ credit ratings
may generally affect the market value of the Notes. Ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks relating
to structure, market and additional factors discussed in this Offering Memorandum, and other factors not discussed
herein may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities
and may be revised or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time. An explanation of the significance of such
rating may be obtained from the applicable rating agency. There is no assurance that such credit ratings will be
issued or remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or
withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in the applicable rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant.
It is also possible that such ratings may be lowered in connection with the application of the proceeds of this
offering or in connection with future events, such as future acquisitions. Holders of the Notes will have no recourse
against us or any other parties in the event of a change in or suspension or withdrawal of such ratings. Any
lowering, suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price or marketability
of the Notes.

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes are rated Baa3 or
better by Moody’s and BBB- or better from S&P and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing,
then beginning that day the following provisions of the Indenture will not apply to the Notes: “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”, “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”, “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from_
_Restricted Subsidiaries”, “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”, “—Limitation on Affiliate_
_Transactions” and “—Impairment of Security Interests” and the provisions of clause (3) of the paragraph of the_
covenant described under”—Merger and Consolidation—Altice International”. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the rating assigned by any such rating agency to such Notes should subsequently decline to below Baa3 or BBB-,
respectively, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as of and from the date of such rating decline.

If these covenants were to be suspended, we would be able to incur additional debt or make payments, including
dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes. There can be no
assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**_The Issuer is incorporated under and subject to Luxembourg law, and Luxembourg insolvency laws may not_**
**_be as favorable as insolvency laws in other jurisdictions._**

The Issuer is a public limited liability company (société anonyme) incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy
of Luxembourg and has its center of main interests in Luxembourg. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with
respect to the Issuer may proceed under, and be governed by, Luxembourg insolvency laws. The rights of the
holders of the Notes and the responsibilities of the Issuer to the holders of the Notes under Luxembourg law may
be materially different from those with regard to equivalent instruments under the laws of the jurisdiction in which
the Notes are offered. Additionally, the insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to the holders of
the Notes as insolvency laws of jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency laws in Luxembourg. Under Luxembourg
insolvency laws, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be
opened against the Issuer to the extent that the Issuer has its registered office or center of main interest in
Luxembourg:

- bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the Issuer, by any of its creditors
or by the Luxembourg public prosecutor. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may open
bankruptcy proceedings, if the Issuer (a) is in default of payment (cessation de paiements) and (b) has lost its
commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a court considers that these conditions are met, it
may open bankruptcy proceedings, absent a request made by the Issuer or a creditor. The main effect of such
proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the Issuer except, subject to certain
limited exceptions, for secured creditors, and the payment of creditors in accordance with their rank upon the
realization of assets;

- controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested by the
Issuer and not by its creditors; and

- composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), the opening of which may only be requested by
the Issuer (having received prior consent of a majority of its creditors) and not by its creditors. The court’s
decision to admit a company to the composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of
claims by unsecured creditors.

In addition to these proceedings, the ability of the holders of the Notes to receive payment on the Notes may be
affected by a decision of a court to grant a reprieve from payments (sursis de paiements) or to put the Issuer into
judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the
public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious violation
of the commercial code or of the Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended.
The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to
bankruptcy proceedings.

The Issuer’s liabilities in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the Issuer following bankruptcy
or judicial liquidation proceedings, rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose
of such liquidation) and those of the Issuer’s debts that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential
debts under Luxembourg law for instance include, among others:

- certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

- value added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise;

- social security contributions; and

- remuneration owed to employees.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to
unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized).

During insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. The ability of
secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited in the event of controlled management
proceedings automatically causing the rights of secured creditors to be frozen until a final decision has been taken


-----

by the court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order
given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors
representing more than 50% of the Issuer’s liabilities in order to take effect.

The Collateral Act 2005 expressly provides that all financial collateral arrangements (including pledges) including
enforcement measures are valid and enforceable even if entered into during the pre-bankruptcy period, against all
third parties including supervisors, receivers, liquidators and any other similar persons or bodies irrespective of
any bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation, national or foreign, of composition with creditors or reorganization
affecting anyone of the parties, save in the case of fraud.

Generally, Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer
during the pre-bankruptcy hardening period (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months and the 10
days preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the
start of the suspect period at an earlier date. In particular:

- pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, some specific transactions (in particular, the
granting of a security interest for antecedent debts, save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within
the meaning of the Collateral Act 2005; the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is
made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have
fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or
with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding
it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver;

- pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce payments made for matured debts as well as
other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to cancellation by the
court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of
the bankrupt’s cessation of payments;

- pursuant to article 21 (2) of the Collateral Act 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements,
notwithstanding the suspect period as referred to in articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce,
where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered into on the date of the commencement of a
reorganization measure or winding up proceedings, but after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the
coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, that agreement is
enforceable and binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other
similar organs if the collateral taker proves that it ignored the fact that such proceedings had been opened or
that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it; and

- pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the civil code (action
_paulienne) the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent_
payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the
bankruptcy, without any time limit.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of
contracts except for _intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its_
solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the insolvency
receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts. However, as of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no
interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis á vis the bankruptcy estate. The bankruptcy order provides for a
period of time during which creditors must file their claims with the clerk’s office of the Luxembourg district
court sitting in commercial matters. After having converted all available assets of the company into cash and after
having determined all the company’s liabilities, the insolvency receiver will distribute the proceeds of the sale, on
a pro rata basis, to the creditors after deduction of the receiver fees and the bankruptcy administration costs.

**_Rights of holders of Notes to enforce, secure and realize their rights under the Senior Secured Collateral may_**
**_be adversely affected in Israeli insolvency proceedings._**

The ability of the holders of Notes to enforce, secure and realize their rights under the Senior Secured Collateral
may be delayed, restricted, subordinated, completely terminated or otherwise adversely affected in any insolvency
proceedings conducted under Israeli jurisdiction or subject to Israeli law. Israeli insolvency law generally favors
the continuation of a business over immediate payment of creditors. The following factors, among others, may
adversely affect rights of secured creditors generally and in insolvency proceedings particularly:


-----

- Fraudulent conveyance principles and other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights and remedies generally
and by application by a competent court of equitable principles. Under Israeli law, any transfer of asset or
creation of a security interest by a debtor may be declared not enforceable in liquidation, reorganization or
composition proceedings of the debtor if, generally, the following conditions are met: (a) the debtor is deemed
insolvent (as defined in and construed under Israeli law principles) at the time of the conveyance; (b) the
conveyance is effected in the three months prior to the commencement of the liquidation or reorganization
proceedings; and (c) the conveyance is made by the debtor with the intention of fraudulently preferring a
certain creditor or as a result of illegal coercion or persuasion by the creditor. A specific fraudulent
conveyance rule applies to security interests created under a floating charge. Under Israeli law, a floating
charge created during the six months prior to the start of the liquidation, reorganization or composition
proceedings may be construed as invalid as to the indebtedness secured thereunder and not advanced by the
creditor holding the floating charge at the creation of the pledge or immediately thereafter (together with
interest at the rate set by law), unless sufficient proof exists to support the fact that the debtor was solvent
immediately following the creation of the floating charge.

- The issuance of a liquidation order by a court of competent authority in respect of a company results in a stay
of proceedings. Upon the issuance of the liquidation order, creditors of a company are prohibited from taking
any action against the company or its assets to secure or realize their rights, and any such proceedings not
completed are stayed. However, the liquidation order does not prevent creditors holding a secured interest
from enforcing and realizing their collateral or to otherwise use it in a different manner (although the
enforcement process may be procedurally limited in a certain manner). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a court
of competent authority may order a moratorium on proceedings against a company for a period of up to nine
months (and may extend that period for additional three month periods (without limitation as to the aggregate
time frame), for special reasons) if the court is convinced that the moratorium may contribute to the formation
of a compromise or arrangement between the company, its shareholders and its creditors. Secured creditors
are restricted from enforcing their collateral during the moratorium period, unless the court is convinced that
either (i) no adequate protection exists to safeguard the secured creditors’ rights or (ii) enforcement of the
secured creditor’s rights will not jeopardize the ability of the company to duly form and approve the
arrangement or compromise so contemplated.

- Claims and rights of creditors of a company in insolvency proceedings may abate in whole or in part due to
insufficient funds and assets of the company in insolvency. Generally, the distribution of assets in insolvency
proceedings is governed by two core principles: the principle of absolute superiority, according to which
creditors of a certain class, who rank higher in priority to other creditors, will be permitted to satisfy their
interests in full prior to creditors of a different class, who rank lower in priority, and the principle of absolute
equality, according to which creditors of the same class will have a pro rata right to secure and satisfy their
interest with other creditors of the same class. Generally, subject to certain exceptions, creditors holding a
fixed pledge or charge rank higher in priority to shareholders and other unsecured creditors of a company and
may, subject to the limitations described above, proceed in enforcing their security interest without
interference. Such creditors are entitled to use the proceeds received in connection with the realization of their
security interest to satisfy their entire claim but will be treated as unsecured creditors with respect to any
portion of their claim not entirely satisfied by the proceeds so received if such proceeds are insufficient to
repay their entire interest. Creditors holding a fixed pledge or charge may, however, be subordinated to (i)
certain creditors statutorily preferred under Israeli law (e.g. tax authorities holding a tax lien in respect of
taxes owed and not paid on real estate property of the company); (ii) certain creditors holding a statutory lien;
and (iii) creditors holding a fixed pledge or charge over specific assets which were acquired or received by
the company using debt advanced by such creditors.

The powers of the court under Israeli insolvency laws have been exercised broadly to protect a restructuring entity
from actions taken by creditors and other parties and to approve various payments to be made by the restructuring
entity and various arrangements with specific creditors or classes of creditors. Accordingly, following
commencement of or during such proceeding, we cannot predict if payments under the Notes would be made,
whether or when the holders of Notes, the Trustee or the Security Agent could exercise their respective rights
under the Indenture and the documents governing the Senior Secured Collateral or whether and to what extent
holders of Notes would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and cost, including
the fees and disbursements of the Trustee.

Furthermore, based on an amendment to the Israeli Companies Law which became effective in January 2013, the
following additional factors may adversely affect rights of secured creditors:


-----

- without approval of creditors, a company will be permitted to use an asset which is subject to a charge,
including selling the asset free of liens (in the ordinary course of business with either the agreement of the
creditor or court approval, and not in the ordinary course of business if approved by the court) if necessary
for the reorganization of the company. The secured creditor must have “adequate protection”, either from the
proceeds of the sale or an asset acquired to replace the asset subject to the disposition. If the asset which is
subject to a security interest is sold, the proceeds of sale or any replacement asset which can be identified or
traced will be subject to a corresponding security interest in favor of the secured creditor.

- without approval of creditors, the company will be able to raise new financing for the continued operations
of the company subject to a stay order issued by a court. This new financing is treated as an expense of the
reorganization, and is therefore given priority over other liabilities of the company. In such a financing, the
company may create a charge in favor of the lenders that would have priority to the existing security interests
if the court believes it necessary for the company to raise the funds. The court would need to be satisfied that
there is “adequate protection” for the existing secured creditors notwithstanding the creation of the new
security interest. See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security
_Interests—Israel”._

Similarly, in the event that rehabilitation or restructuring is not sought or does not succeed, the rights of the holders
of the Notes and the Trustee to enforce remedies are likely to be sufficiently impaired by bankruptcy, receivership
or other liquidation proceedings under applicable Israeli laws such as the Bankruptcy Ordinance (New Version)—
1980 and the Companies Ordinance (New Version)—1983, if the benefit of such laws is sought.

**_It may be difficult to enforce civil liabilities or judgments against Dominican companies or their directors and_**
**_executive officers outside the Dominican Republic._**

Altice Dominicana is organized under the laws of the Dominican Republic and substantially all of its assets are
located in the Dominican Republic. As a result, it may not be possible for a noteholder to enforce judgments
against Altice Dominicana outside the Dominican Republic.

The Dominican Republic is not party to any treaties providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments rendered in judicial proceedings with respect to civil and commercial matters. For a foreign judgment
to be effective and enforceable in the Dominican Republic, a request for exequatur (a judgment issued by a
Dominican court validating a foreign judicial decision) must be presented before the Court of First Instance
(Juzgado de Primera Instancia) of the Dominican Republic. The Court of First Instance will examine the foreign
judicial decision to determine whether to ratify or deny its execution under Dominican law. If exequatur is granted,
the judgment issued by the foreign court will be enforceable in the Dominican Republic. In a judicial process
seeking _exequatur to enforce a foreign judgment the Dominican courts’ examination of the matter should be_
limited to procedural issues such as jurisdiction, due service of process, the opportunity of the parties to present
their respective cases, adherence to public policy rules, enforcement matters and the requirements necessary for
authenticity in the Dominican Republic, such as official translations into Spanish. In practice, however,
Dominican courts have substantial discretion and may revisit the merits of the case, if deemed necessary.
Procedures for obtaining an exequatur could be lengthy.

With respect to the recognition and enforcement of decisions rendered in arbitration proceedings, the Dominican
Republic is party to the 1958 New York Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards
(the “New York Convention”) since 2002, without reservation. Dominican Law No. 489 08 on Commercial
Arbitration (Ley No. 498 08 sobre Arbitraje Comercial) sets forth the process to obtain an exequatur for a foreign
arbitral award as an ex parte process in which the petitioner is required to file a motion requesting the exequatur
(along with an original, duly legalized and certified counterpart of the award and the arbitration clause or
agreement to arbitrate). The Civil and Commercial Court of First Instance of the National District (Cámara Civil
_y Comercial del Juzgado de Primera Instancia del Distrito Nacional) has exclusive jurisdiction to grant exequatur_
for foreign arbitral awards. The grounds for a judge to deny an exequatur are the same as the ones provided for in
the New York Convention. The decision granting an exequatur to a foreign arbitral award can be challenged
through an annulment claim on the grounds specifically provided in the law (which are the same grounds as those
established in the New York Convention). There are precedents of exequaturs granted to foreign arbitral awards
based on the New York Convention as well as under the Law No. 489 08 on Commercial Arbitration. There are
also precedents from the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Justice (Suprema Corte de Justicia) of the
Dominican Republic on matters relating to annulment claims filed against decisions granting exequatur to foreign
arbitral awards. Although Dominican courts typically validate foreign judicial decisions and arbitral awards that
do not conflict with the public policy of the Dominican Republic, there is no assurance that the Civil and


-----

Commercial Chamber of the Court of First Instance of the National District will render a decision ratifying any
such foreign judgment or arbitral award.

On the other hand, as a matter of public policy, the property of the Dominican State cannot be subject to seizure
or foreclosure for repayment of obligations incurred during the course of operating or using such property. This
policy cannot be waived by the Dominican government. Therefore, even if an arbitral award or legal decision
were rendered against the Dominican government and validated in that country, such judgment may not be
enforced against the property of the Dominican State. However, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Dominican
Republic has stated that, under certain circumstances, the principle of non-seizure of the State’s property (or
immunity from seizure) may not be applicable, particularly if the “public entity” to which property has been seized
and/or enforcement is being sought, is a concessionaire of the Dominican government, as opposed to the
Dominican government itself, and has been incorporated as a commercial entity to perform commercial and
industrial activities on its own.

The Dominican State is the owner of the radioelectric spectrum. Under the rule of non-seizure of State property
such frequencies (or the right to use the same) may not be seized by a creditor. However, General
Telecommunications Law No. 153 98 provides that concession and license rights may be pledged as security on
the condition that a prior authorization from Indotel is obtained, which shall not be denied without justified cause.

**_It may be difficult to enforce civil liabilities or judgments against Portuguese companies or their directors and_**
**_executive officers outside of Portugal._**

The assets of the Portuguese companies or their directors may be substantially located in Portugal. As a result, it
may not be possible for a holder of the Notes to enforce judgements against Portuguese companies or their
directors outside of Portugal.

However, a judgment given in an EU country will, in principle, be enforceable in Portugal without re-examination
of the merits, subject to the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament
and of the Council of December 12, 2012, on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in
civil and commercial matters, and shall be directly enforceable in Portugal without the need to request a
declaration of enforceability (“exequator”), as per article 39 of the Regulation. Notwithstanding this, judgments
of EU countries will not be recognized in Portugal, among other circumstances, if: (i) such recognition is
manifestly contrary to Portuguese public policy; (ii) the defendant was not served with the document that instituted
the proceedings in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable the defendant to arrange for his/her defense; (iii)
it is irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in Portugal; (iv) it is irreconcilable
with an earlier judgment given in another EU or non-EU country involving the same cause of action and the same
parties, provided that the earlier judgment fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in Portugal.

Nevertheless, Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12,
2012, on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters is not
applicable to the following matters: (i) the status or legal capacity of natural persons, matrimonial matters, wills
and succession; (ii) bankruptcy; (iii) social security; and (iv) arbitration.

Foreign judgments duly obtained outside the EU will be enforceable in Portugal after being reviewed and
authorized (exequátur) by a Portuguese court in accordance with article 978 of the Portuguese Civil Procedure
Code. According to article 979 of the said Code, the Portuguese court competent to review and authorise
(exequátur) the judgment is the Tribunal da Relação (court of appeal) of the judicial district where the person
against whom the judgment will be enforced is domiciled. Pursuant to articles 703, 980 and others of the
Portuguese Civil Procedure Code, in order for the judgment to be authorized: (i) there must be no doubts regarding
the authenticity of the document containing the judgment or about the intelligibility of the judgment; (ii) the matter
at issue must be res judicata according to the laws of the country that rendered the judgment; (iii) the competence
of the court was not claimed fraudulently and that the case submitted did not fall under the exclusive competence
of the Portuguese courts; (iv) the exceptions of lis pendens and res judicata cannot be alleged on the grounds that
there is a case pending before a Portuguese court unless the foreign court prevented jurisdiction; (v) the defendant
must have been duly notified of the legal action in accordance with the laws of the country where the judgment
was rendered, and in the proceedings the principles that the parties have a right to equal treatment and to contest
claims were complied with; and (vi) the outcome of the judgment rendered cannot be manifestly incompatible
with the international public policy of Portugal.


-----

With respect to the recognition and enforcement of decisions rendered in arbitration proceedings, Portugal is party
to the New York Convention without reservation.

Moreover, Portuguese Law No. 63/2011 of December 14, 2011 on Arbitration sets forth the process to obtain an
exequatur for a foreign arbitral award, in which the petitioner is required to file a motion requesting the exequatur
(along with an original, duly legalized and certified counterpart of the award and the arbitration clause or
agreement to arbitrate). The grounds for a judge to deny an exequatur are set forth in article 56 of the abovementioned Portuguese Arbitration Law.

**_Transfers of the Notes are restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws of the United States. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered
under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws. Therefore, you may not transfer or sell the Notes
in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an effective registration
statement, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment in the Notes for an indefinite period of
time. The Notes and the Indenture will contain provisions that restrict the Notes from being offered, sold or
otherwise transferred except pursuant to the exemptions available pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S, or
other exemptions under the U.S. Securities Act. In addition, by acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder
thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor accounts for which it has purchased the Notes that
it shall not transfer the Notes, as applicable, in an aggregate principal amount of less than €100,000, in the case
of the Euro Notes and $200,000, in the case of the Dollar Notes. Furthermore, the Issuer has not registered the
Notes under any other country’s securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the
Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Notice to Investors”
and “Plan of Distribution”.

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Guarantors are organized
under the laws of Portugal, Luxembourg, Israel and the Dominican Republic. It is anticipated that some or all of
the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and Guarantors will be non-residents of the United States and
that all or a majority of their assets will be located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible
for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective
directors and executive officers, or to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability
provisions of the U.S. securities laws. Additionally, there is doubt as to the enforceability in many foreign
jurisdictions of civil liabilities based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the
United States against ourselves, the Guarantors, the directors, controlling persons and management and any
experts named in this Offering Memorandum who are not residents of the United States. See “Limitation on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests”._

**_The Notes may be treated as issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes may be treated as having been issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
An obligation generally is treated as having been issued with original issue discount if its stated principal amount
exceeds its issue price by at least a defined de minimis amount. If a Note is treated as issued with original issue
discount, investors subject to U.S. federal income tax will be subject to tax on that original issue discount as
ordinary income as it accrues, generally in advance of the receipt of cash payments attributable to that income
(and in addition to qualified stated interest). See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations”._

**_You may face currency exchange risks or adverse tax consequences by investing in the Notes denominated in_**
**_currencies other than your reference currency._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in U.S. dollars and euros. If you are a non-U.S. dollar or non-euro
investor, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible
significant changes in the value of the euro or U.S. dollar relative to other relevant currencies because of economic,
political or other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro or U.S. dollar against other
relevant currencies could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and
could result in a loss to you when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you


-----

measure the return on your investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. investors may also have important tax
consequences as a result of foreign currency exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Certain Tax Considerations—
_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”._

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or the holders of the Notes unless and until
Notes in registered definitive form (“Definitive Notes”) are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead,
the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream and/or DTC (or their respective nominee) will be the sole
holder of the global notes representing the Notes.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be made
to the Principal Paying Agent and the U.S. Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear, Clearstream
and/or DTC, as applicable. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to Euroclear, Clearstream and/or DTC, as
applicable, participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Notes, as applicable, in global form and
credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to Euroclear, Clearstream and/or DTC, as
applicable, none of us, the Security Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Paying Agents will have any
responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments of interest, principal or other
amounts to Euroclear, Clearstream and/or DTC, as applicable, or to owners of book-entry interests.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests
for waivers or other actions from the holders of the Notes, including enforcement of security for the Notes. Instead,
if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act directly only to the extent you have received
appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear, Clearstream and/or DTC, as applicable, or, if applicable, from a
participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient
to enable you to vote on any requested actions or to take any other action on a timely basis. See “Book-Entry,
_Delivery and Form”._

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS OF THE GROUP**

_The following discussion and analysis is intended to assist in providing an understanding of the Group’s financial_
_condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations and should be read together with (i) in the_
_case of financial information as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the unaudited_
_condensed consolidated financial statements of Altice International as of and for the three month period ended_
_March 31, 2021 (including comparative information as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2020),_
_prepared in accordance with IAS 34, which have been reviewed by KPMG Luxembourg, Société cooperative (the_
_“Unaudited Financial Statements”), (ii) in the case of financial information as of and for the years ended_
_December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 the consolidated financial statements of Altice International as of_
_and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (including comparative information as of and for the year ended_
_December 31, 2019), which have been audited by KPMG Luxembourg, Société cooperative (the “2020 Financial_
**_Statements”) and (iii) in the case of financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, the_**
_consolidated financial statements of Altice International as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019_
_(including comparative information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018), which have been audited_
_by Deloitte Audit S.à r.l. (the “2019 Financial Statements”, and together with the 2020 Financial Statements,_
_the “Audited Financial Statements”), and in each case, prepared in accordance with IFRS. The historical_
_consolidated financial information of Altice International described above, including the accompanying notes_
_thereto, are referred to herein as the “Historical Consolidated Financial Information”. Some of the information_
_in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See_
_“Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a discussion of important factors to be evaluated in_
_connection with an investment in the Notes._

_Unless the context otherwise requires, when used in this section, the terms “we”, “our”, “Altice International”,_
_“Company”, the “Group” and “us” refer to the business constituting the Group as of the date of this Offering_
_Memorandum even though we may not have owned such business for the entire duration of the periods presented._

_The Group applies International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed in the EU (“IFRS”). Adjusted_
_EBITDA, Operating Free Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures (Accrued), and measures derived therefrom, are_
_not defined in IFRS and are “non-IFRS measures”. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Free_
_Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures (Accrued) are useful to readers of the Historical Consolidated Financial_
_Information as they provide a measure of operating results excluding certain items that we believe are either_
_outside of our recurring operating activities, or items that are non-cash. Excluding such items enables trends in_
_our operating results and cash flow generation to be more easily observable. We use the non-IFRS measures_
_internally to manage and assess the results of our operations, make decisions with respect to investments and_
_allocation of resources, and assess the performance of management personnel. Such performance measures are_
_also the de facto metrics used by investors and other members of the financial community to value other companies_
_operating in our industry, and thus are a basis for comparability between us and our peers. Further, Adjusted_
_EBITDA, Operating Free Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures (Accrued), as used herein, are not necessarily_
_comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Free_
_Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures (Accrued) have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered_
_in isolation from, or as an alternative to, net income or loss, operating profit, cash flow or other combined income_
_or cash flow data prepared in accordance with IFRS. For further details, see “Presentation of Financial and_
_Other Information” included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Basis of Presentation**

This discussion and analysis for each of the periods presented is based on the financial information derived from
the Historical Consolidated Financial Information. The Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 (Amendments
to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16), have mandatory application for periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2021, as described in Note 1.3.2 of the 2020 Financial Statements, and had no material impacts on the
amounts recognized as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and on the disclosure in the Unaudited
Financial Statements.

The Group has adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method of adoption with the date of initial
application of January 1, 2019. Upon adoption of IFRS 16, the Group applied a single recognition and
measurement approach for all leases that it is the lessee. The Group recognized lease liabilities to make lease
payments and ROU assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. The standard provides specific
transition requirements and practical expedients, which have been applied by the Group. The main effects of the


-----

adoption of IFRS 16 on assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2019, were a recognition of ROU assets of €896
million which are recognized and presented separately in the statement of financial position and include the lease
assets in the amount of €19 million previously recognized under finance leases and reclassified from the property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets line items, and an increase in lease liabilities by €930 million (current
and non-current) (including the reclassification of finance lease liabilities already recorded as of December 31,
2018 in the amount of €54 million) of which the current and non-current liabilities increased by €853 million and
€77 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.

As of December 31, 2019, current and non-current lease liabilities increased by €83 million and €840 million,
respectively, compared to December 31, 2018 mainly due to the adoption of IFRS 16, which was offset by lease
payments for the year ended December 31, 2019. The variance in non-current and current lease liabilities is
calculated by taking the difference between the non-current and current lease liabilities recorded as of December
31, 2019 compared to the non-current and current financial leases recorded as of December 31, 2018. In the year
ended December 31, 2019, interest expenses related to lease liabilities amounted to €74 million following the
adoption of IFRS 16 compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 1.3.3 to the 2019 Financial
Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, for more information.

The financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the 2019 Financial Statements has not been
restated for the impacts of IFRS 16. See Note 1.3.3 to the 2019 Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum, for more information.

**_Operational Activities_**

From time to time we review the presentation of revenues generated by our operational activities to more closely
align to the day-to-day operational and strategic divisions in which our business is managed.

From January 1, 2020, we present revenue by activity under “Residential-Fixed”, “Residential-Mobile”,
“Residential Equipment”, “Business Services” and “Media”, and for the purposes of discussion of results for the
year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 we have presented revenue by activity for the
year ended December 31, 2019 under the same segments. Prior to January 1, 2020, we presented revenue by
activity under “Residential-Fixed”, “Residential-Mobile”, “Business Services” and “Media” (with revenue from
equipment sales included under “Residential-Fixed” and “Residential-Mobile”, as applicable), and for the
discussion of results for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 we have presented
revenue by activity under these segments.

For further details, see “—Key Income Statement Items”.

**_Operating Segments_**

We discuss the results of operations for our business based on five operating segments, namely Portugal, Israel,
the Dominican Republic, Teads and Others (which includes all other corporate entities). Each of the Portugal,
Israel and the Dominican Republic segments includes the relevant Altice Technical Services entities in its
jurisdictions. A sixth segment, Altice TV, comprising our content business through the use of content rights, was
reported for the year ended December 31, 2018 and is included in the 2019 Financial Statements. Altice TV is no
longer part of the Group following its sale to an affiliate that was closed on May 15, 2018.

Please refer to Note 4 of the Unaudited Financial Statements for further details on the description of each segment.

Please refer to Note 3 of the Historical Consolidated Financial Information for a complete overview of the changes
in the scope of consolidation during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 and the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, please refer to “—Discussion and Analysis of Our

_Historical Results”._

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

Our operations and the operating metrics discussed below have been, and may continue to be, affected by certain
key factors as well as certain historical events and actions. The key factors, among others, affecting the ordinary
course of our business and our results of operations are discussed below.

**_Acquisitions and Integration of Businesses, Disposals and Strategic Initiatives_**

We have from time to time made significant direct and indirect equity investments in, and divestments of, several
cable and telecommunication businesses and ancillary service providers in various jurisdictions. Due to the
significant nature of certain of these acquisitions and disposals, the comparability of our results of operations
based on the Historical Consolidated Financial Information may be affected. See “—Discussion and Analysis of
_Our Results of Operations—Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 compared to the Three Months Ended March_
_31, 2020—Significant Events Affecting Historical Results”, “—Discussion and Analysis of Our Results of_
_Operations—Year Ended December 31, 2020 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019—Significant_
_Events Affecting Historical Results” and “—Discussion and Analysis of Our Results of Operations—Year Ended_
_December 31, 2019 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018—Significant Events Affecting Historical_
_Results”. In addition, we generally record goodwill relating to acquisitions. As of March 31, 2021, the goodwill_
recorded on our statement of financial position amounted to €3,175 million (compared to €3,139 million as of
December 31, 2020 and €3,248 million as of December 31, 2019). Goodwill is subject to impairment reviews in
accordance with IFRS and any impairment charge on goodwill would have a negative impact on operating profit.
For the three months ended March 31, 2021, we did not identify any changes in circumstances indicating that the
carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Therefore, in the first quarter of 2021 no impairment review
has been performed and we did not incur any impairment losses.

In general, our results of operations in historical periods have been impacted by actions taken and expenditures
incurred to improve the operational performance of our businesses. We have aimed to integrate and improve the
businesses by focusing on several key areas, including (i) investing in the Group’s fiber network, migrating
existing DSL subscribers to the Group’s own network and reducing the need for third party network services, (ii)
continuous investments in the Group’s mobile infrastructure, such as 5G, (iii) improving and simplifying
operational processes and reducing IT costs by investing in new platforms, (iv) integrating sales organizations,
optimizing the Group’s sales channels and simplifying the Group’s brand portfolio, (v) implementing procurement
efficiencies by leveraging the Group’s bargaining power and (vi) reducing overhead costs.

At the core of the Group’s strategy is customer, revenue, profitability and cash flow growth by efficiently running
telecom assets, creating underlying organic growth, and as a result, achieving a leverage profile consistent with
the stated target leverage range. The Group benefits from a unique asset base which is fully convergent, fiber rich,
active across residential consumers and businesses and holds number one or number two positions in each of its
markets with nationwide coverage. The reinforced operational focus offers significant value creation potential.
Key elements of the Group’s growth strategy include:

   - Building operational and financial turnaround in Portugal;

   - Optimizing the performance in each market with a particular focus on customer services;

   - Continuing to invest in best-in-class infrastructure commensurate with our market position;

   - Growing advertising revenue; and

   - The potential monetization of part of the Group companies’ infrastructure and assets at attractive
valuations.

For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred other expenses and income of €(59) million and
€367 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this comprised primarily of a net gain on sale
of interest in associates of €101 million from the sale of PT Portugal’s 25% equity stake in Belmont which was
partially offset by restructuring costs relating to termination payments in connection with the voluntary employee
reduction program in PT Portugal, and for the year ended December 31, 2019, this comprised primarily of


-----

restructuring costs relating to the voluntary employee reduction program undertaken in Portugal in 2019 for which
a €293 million expense, which will be tax deductible upon payment, was recorded. For the three months ended
March 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred other expenses and income of €245 million and €(90) million, respectively.
For three months ended March 31, 2021, this comprised primarily of €241 million costs relating to the preretirement program in Portugal launched in March 2021 and for three months ended March 31, 2020, this
comprised primarily of net gain on sale of interest in associates of €98 million from the sale of PT Portugal’s 25%
equity stake in Belmont. Other expenses and income primarily include costs with respect to renegotiations or
termination of contractual arrangements, employee redundancies, fees paid to external counsel, capital gain or
loss on investing activities and other administrative expenses related to reorganization of existing or newly
acquired businesses.

**_Multi-Play Strategy_**

Across the jurisdictions in which we operate, we have implemented a business strategy focused on the provision
and expansion of multi-play product offerings, including triple-play (“3P”) and quad-play (“4P”) bundles.
Customers who elect to subscribe for our multi-play bundles rather than our individual services realize
comparative cost savings on their monthly bill. We believe that the enhanced value proposition associated with
our bundled services enables us to meet our customers’ communication and entertainment requirements while
concurrently both increasing customer loyalty and attracting new customers. As a result of our focus on providing
subscribers with multi-play bundles, we have experienced an increase in the number of our fiber/cable customer
relationships from 2,160,000 as of December 31, 2019 to 2,339,000 as of December 31, 2020 to 2,366,000 as of
March 31, 2021. We believe our bundled service offerings will be an important driver of our fixed-based services,
partially offsetting the continued pressure on traditional fixed-based services.

**_Introduction of New Products and Services and Investment in Content_**

We have expanded our presence and product and service offerings in the past. The introduction of new products
and services have impacted our result of operations in the periods presented by, among other things, opening new
revenue streams and/or increasing the profitability of existing revenue streams (e.g. 4P and our fiber roll-out plan
in Portugal through FastFiber, which involved extending our fiber proprietary network to in excess of 600,000
additional homes per year for 2020, and advertising services provided by Teads) and, in certain cases, increasing
operating expenses and Total Capital Expenditures (e.g., the fiber-roll out in Portugal and UMTS and LTE
network build-out costs and roaming costs in Israel relating to our 3G, 4G and 5G mobile services). In addition,
through Altice Labs, S.A. (“Altice Labs”) we continue to invest in and make available technologically-advanced
customer equipment in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we have launched new offers with new
sports and other content in order to differentiate our product offering and to underline our investment in sports
rights and other nonlinear content. We regularly review and invest in the content that we offer to provide our
subscribers with a flexible and diverse range of programming options, including high-quality local content and
exclusive premium content. In addition, the Group is focused on supplementing its own content offerings with
premium content produced by or purchased from third parties. At the end of 2015 and at the beginning of 2016,
PT Portugal entered into contracts with several first and second division football clubs in Portugal, including F.C.
Porto, Vitoria F.C., Rio Ave F.C. and Boavista F.C., to acquire the exclusive broadcasting rights for the home
games of these clubs for up to ten football seasons and in February 2017 we acquired a 25% stake in the capital
of the Portuguese sports broadcaster SPORT TV. In June 2017, we announced a multi-year partnership with
Netflix which allows customers to watch Netflix’s content with eligible devices in Portugal, Israel and the
Dominican Republic. We intend to continue to selectively invest in local and value-added premium content as
well as sports broadcasting and distribution rights in the future to enrich our differentiated and convergent
communication services from those of our competitors. We believe that such efforts will reduce our customer
churn and increase revenue.

**_Pricing_**

We focus our product offerings on multi-play offers. The cost of a multi-play subscription package generally
depends on market conditions, our competitors’ pricing of similar offerings and the content and add-ons available
on each platform. In general, the greater the optionality, content and usage time included in the offering, the higher
the price of the multi-play package. Our ability to increase or maintain the prices for our fixed-based and mobile
services is also limited by regulatory factors in each of the regions in which we operate. In Portugal, for example,
the imposition by ANACOM of price controls on interconnection charges as well as the continuous reduction of
mobile termination rates have caused interconnection revenues for fixed-line and mobile telephony to steadily
decline, although this has been partially offset by the lower interconnection costs we incur. The prices of B2B


-----

contracts are negotiated individually with each customer. The B2B market for voice services is extremely pricesensitive and entails very low margins as voice services are highly commoditized, involving sophisticated
customers and relatively short-term contracts. The B2B market for data services is less price-sensitive, as data
services require more customization and involve service level agreements. In both markets, price competition is
strongest in the large corporate and public-sector segments, whereas customer-adapted solutions are an important
competitive focus in the medium and small business segments. We have tailored our targeted pricing strategy to
account for these dynamics.

**_Cost Structure_**

We generally work towards achieving satisfactory operating margins in our businesses and focus on revenueenhancing measures once we have achieved such margins. We continuously work towards optimizing our cost
base by streamlining processes and service offerings, improving productivity by centralizing our business
functions, reorganizing our procurement process, eliminating duplicative management functions and overhead,
terminating lower-return projects and non-essential consulting and third-party service agreements, and investing
in our employee relations and our culture. We continuously implement common technological platforms across
our networks to gain economies of scale, notably with respect to billing systems, network improvements and
customer premises equipment and are investing in sales, marketing and innovation, including brand-building,
enhancing our sales channels and automating provisioning and installation processes. We have also achieved, and
expect to continue to achieve, substantial reductions in our operating expenses as we implement uniform bestpractice operational processes across our organization. We have simplified the services we offer, insourced our
historical suppliers around technical services to better control quality and reduced costs through the negotiation
of attractive interconnection rates and television content pricing.

**_Network Upgrades_**

Our ability to provide new or enhanced fixed-based services, including high-definition television (“HDTV”) and
VoD television services, broadband internet at increasing speeds and fixed-line telephony services as well as 3G
and 4G mobile services to additional subscribers depends in part on our ability to upgrade our (i) cable and DSL
networks by extending the fiber portion of our network, reducing the number of nodes per home passed and
upgrading technical components of our network and (ii) mobile networks including to support 4G services and
introduce 5G services in certain jurisdictions, as well as maintaining agreements with third parties to share mobile
networks.

In recent years, we have increased our fiber deployment and upgraded a significant part of our cable networks.
Our fixed-line services in Portugal are primarily delivered over FTTH, DSL and DTH, in Israel are primarily
delivered over HFC cables (and since April 2021, fiber-based internet services are also delivered over IBC Israel’s
fiber optic network in certain areas where the network had already been deployed) and in the Dominican Republic
are delivered over both HFC cable and FTTH, in each case that are among the most technically advanced in the
markets in which we operate. Our cable networks enable us to offer download speeds of at least 200 Mbps to a
majority of homes passed in our footprint in Israel and the Dominican Republic. In Portugal and the Dominican
Republic, we continue to upsell our fiber/cable based services to our existing DSL subscriber base. In Portugal,
we own 50.01% of FastFiber which in turn owns the largest fiber network by penetration that passed 5,699,000
homes as of March 31, 2021. We also implemented our fiber rollout strategy in Portugal and through FastFiber
we rolled out 388,000 new fiber homes passed in 2018, 356,000 new fiber homes passed in 2019, 603,000 new
fiber homes passed in 2020 and a further 73,000 fiber homes passed in the three months ended March 31, 2021.
In the periods under review, the Group has also built-out its 4G network to have advanced mobile networks in
place in each of its geographies (4G population coverage as of March 31, 2021 of 99.6% in Portugal, 99.9% in
Israel and 97.5% in the Dominican Republic). We have also invested in our 5G network in Israel, and offer 5G
services in certain areas since first quarter of 2021. We have undertaken certain strategic transactions in recent
years to monetize the value of certain non-core assets, including the Towers Transactions. In Israel, the Partner
Network Sharing Agreement enables HOT Mobile and Partner Communications Company Ltd. (“Partner”) to
share antennas and frequencies and facilitate optimum utilization of the spectrum thereby resulting in savings
related to network and maintenance expenses and optimizing Total Capital Expenditures incurred in relation to
the mandatory build-out of our mobile network. We continue to evaluate the need to upgrade our cable networks
for the deployment of additional fiber, and our mobile networks for advancements in LTE technology and in Israel,
to support the introduction of 5G services, on an ongoing basis.

During the periods under review, we have incurred significant Capital Expenditures (Accrued) (20.7%, 19.6%,
19.4% and 20.8% of total consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and the


-----

three months ended March 31, 2021, respectively) in order to improve our mobile network and to roll out new
fiber/cable homes. Our Capital Expenditures (Accrued) amounted to €211 million and €205 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and €840 million, €802 million and €811 million for the
years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

**_Competition_**

In each of the geographies and industries in which the Group operates, the Group faces significant competition
and competitive pressures. Certain markets, such as Portugal, are mature markets, with a limited number of new
customers entering the market. Moreover, the Group’s products and services are subject to increasing competition
from alternative new technologies or improvements in existing technologies.

With respect to its residential activities, the Group faces competition from telephone companies and other
providers of DSL, VDSL2 and fiber network connections. With respect to pay TV services, the Group is faced
with growing competition from alternative methods for broadcasting television services other than through
traditional cable networks. For example, online content aggregators which broadcast OTT programs on a
broadband network, such as internet competitors Amazon, Apple, Google, Disney+ and Netflix, are expected to
grow stronger in the future. Connected or ‘smart’ TVs facilitate the use of these services. With respect to the
fixed-line and mobile telephony markets, the Group has experienced a shift from fixed-line telephony to mobile
telephony and faces intensive competition from established telephone companies, mobile virtual network
operators (“MVNOs”) and providers of new technologies such as VoIP.

In the competitive B2B data services market, price pressure has been strong. Conversely, the use of data
transmission services has significantly increased. The Group is currently facing competition from software
providers and other IT providers of data and network solutions, and the line between them and the suppliers of
data infrastructure and solutions, like the Group, has become increasingly blurred. Partnerships between IT
providers and infrastructure providers are becoming more and more common and are an additional source of
competition but also an opportunity for growth. Being able to face the competition efficiently depends in part on
the density of the network, and certain of the Group’s competitors in the markets in which we operate have a
broader and denser network. In recent years, the B2B market has experienced a structural change marked by a
move from traditional switched voice services to VoIP services.

For a description of the competitive landscape in the key geographies in which the Group operates, see “Industry
_and Market Overview”._

**_Macroeconomic and Political Developments_**

Our operations are subject to macroeconomic and political risks that are outside of our control. For example, high
levels of sovereign debt in certain European countries and countries in the Middle East, combined with weak
growth and high unemployment, could lead to low consumer demand, fiscal reforms (including austerity
measures), sovereign debt restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of
volatility and, potentially, disruptions in the credit and equity markets, as well as other outcomes that might
adversely impact our financial condition. For example, our results of operations in the periods under review have
been affected by adverse economic conditions and austerity measures in Portugal which had a negative effect on
consumer confidence. Moreover, in Israel, we are subject to the inherent risks associated with political and military
conditions and the potential for armed conflicts with Israel’s neighbors.

The current macroeconomic environment is volatile, and continuing instability in global markets, including
instability related to international trade, tariffs, sovereign debt issues, Brexit, the risk of inflation and deflation
and the stability of the euro, natural disasters and pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), has contributed
to a challenging global economic environment.

**_Debt Service Obligations_**

We have significant outstanding debt and debt service requirements and may incur additional debt in the future.
See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “—Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile” below and “Description
_of_ _Other Indebtedness” included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Our significant level of debt could_
have important consequences, including, but not limited to, our ability to invest in new technologies, products and
content as well as restricting us from exploiting other business opportunities or making acquisitions. It could also
increase our vulnerability to, and reduce our flexibility to respond to, adverse general economic or industry


-----

conditions. Our inability to make additional investments and acquisitions could also affect our ability to compete
with other operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Financial
_Profile—Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of_
_operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations under the Notes or impede our ability to raise_
_additional capital to fund our operations”._

**_Fluctuations in Currency Exchange Rates and Interest Rates_**

Our reporting currency is euro but a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are currently earned or
incurred in other currencies due to which we are exposed to significant foreign currency exchange risk. As a result,
our reported results of operations can be significantly different compared to the results of our businesses,
particularly in Israel and the Dominican Republic on a local currency basis. In Israel, which accounted for 24.1%
of the total revenue of the Group after eliminations in the year ended December 31, 2020, a substantial portion of
our revenue is in NIS while a portion of our operational expenses and Total Capital Expenditures are incurred in
other currencies, including the U.S. dollar. In the year ended December 31, 2020, 16% of our total operating
expenses and 20% of our Total Capital Expenditures in Israel were incurred in currencies other than NIS. In the
Dominican Republic, which accounted for 12.0% of the total revenue of the Group after eliminations in the year
ended December 31, 2020, a substantial portion of our revenue is in DOP while a portion of our operational
expenses and Total Capital Expenditures are incurred in other currencies, including the U.S. dollar. In the year
ended December 31, 2020, 15% of our total operating expenses and 54% of our Total Capital Expenditures in the
Dominican Republic were incurred in currencies other than the DOP. The exchange rate between U.S. dollars and
NIS, the euro and NIS and U.S. dollars and DOP, which affect our operations, and the euro and NIS and euro and
DOP, which affect the translation risk relating to the consolidation of our financial statements, has been volatile
in the past and may continue to be so in the future. Although we attempt to mitigate currency risk to an extent
through hedging, sharp changes in the exchange rate could have a material effect on our results of operations.

Our borrowings are denominated primarily in euro, U.S. dollars and NIS but do not necessarily match the cash
flows generated from operations in such currencies. In addition, a portion of our borrowings bear a floating rate
of interest. While we hedge the risk of certain currency and interest rate fluctuations in respect of a portion of our
existing debt, these arrangements may not insulate us completely from such exposure. Please see Note 8.3 of the
Unaudited Financial Statements for more information.

Moreover, the government of the Dominican Republic has imposed exchange controls and currency restrictions
in the past and may do so in the future. This is beyond our control and may result in the DOP ceasing to be freely
convertible or transferable abroad to service our outstanding indebtedness, or the DOP being significantly
depreciated relative to other currencies, including the U.S. dollar, which may impede our ability to service our
outstanding obligations and affect our earnings and cash flow.

**_Key Operating Measures_**

We use several key operating measures, including number of fiber/cable homes passed, number of fixed unique
B2C customers and number of mobile B2C subscribers to track the financial and operating performance of our
business. None of these terms are measures of financial performance under IFRS, nor have these measures been
audited or reviewed by an auditor, consultant or expert. All of these measures are derived from our internal
operating and financial systems. As defined by our management, these terms may not be directly comparable to
similar terms used by competitors or other companies.

The tables below set forth our key operating measures by geographic segment as of for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 and 2020 and as of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

(1) Portugal fiber homes passed figures include homes where PT OpCo has access through wholesale fiber operators (approximately
0.6 million as of March 31, 2021, approximately 0.5 million as of March 31, 2020, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
and approximately 0.4 million as of December 31, 2018).

(2) Fiber/cable unique customers represents the number of individual end users who have subscribed for one or more of our fiber/cable
based services (including pay television, broadband or telephony), without regard to how many services to which the end user
subscribed. It is calculated on a unique premises basis. For Israel, it refers to the total number of unique customer relationships,
including both B2C and B2B.

(3) Mobile subscribers is equal to the net number of lines or SIM cards that have been activated on the Group’s mobile networks and
excludes machine to machine. In Israel, iDEN technology was decommissioned by the end of 2019 and the split between iDEN
and UMTS (B2C only, including prepaid) services for the year ended December 31, 2018 is as follows:


-----

**As of December 31, 2018**

**Key Income Statement Items**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue consists of income generated from the delivery of fixed-based services to our B2C customers, mobile
services to our B2C customers, equipment sales to residential customers, fixed, mobile and wholesale service and
other revenues to our B2B customers and media service revenues. Revenue is recognized at the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable net of value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating

“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as, (i) for periods prior to the application of IFRS 16, operating profit before

before depreciation, amortization and impairment, other expenses and income (capital gains, non-recurring
litigation, restructuring costs), share-based expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line
recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IAS 17 Leases for operating leases)
allowing comparability for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted EBITDA is unaudited and is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally
accepted accounting standards. We believe that this measure is useful to readers of the Historical Consolidated
Financial Information as it provides them with a measure of the operating results which excludes certain items we
consider outside of our recurring operating activities or that are non-cash, making trends more easily observable
and providing information regarding our operating results that allows investors to better identify trends in our
financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute measure for net income or loss,
operating profit, cash flow or other combined income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with IFRS and
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Further, this measure should not be
considered as an alternative for operating profit as the effects of depreciation, amortization and impairment
excluded from this measure do ultimately affect the operating results, which is also presented within the annual
consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 1 (Presentation of Financial Statements). For a
reconciliation of the Group’s profit/(loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA, see “Summary
_Financial Information and Other Financial Data—Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA—Reconciliation of profit/(loss)_
_from continuing operations and operating profit/(loss) to Adjusted EBITDA”._

**_Significant Events Affecting Historical Results_**

Our results of operations as of and for three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were significantly impacted
by the following events:

_For the three months ended March 31, 2021:_

_Acquisition of IBC Israel_

On September 15, 2020, HOT Telecommunications Systems Ltd (HOT) announced that it had taken a minority
stake in IBC Israel. Post-closing, HOT became an equal partner in the IBC Partnership (that holds 70% of IBC
Israel’s share capital), together with Cellcom and Israel Infrastructure Fund (“IIF”), and HOT indirectly holds
23.3% of IBC Israel’s share capital, through an investment of €45 million, substantially equal to the investment
made by each of Cellcom and IIF. There is an agreement between IBC Israel and HOT, under which HOT
undertakes to purchase an indefeasible right, or IRU, to use IBC Israel’s fiber-optic network. There is also a
service agreement between IBC Israel and HOT, under which IBC Israel undertakes to purchase certain services
from HOT. The transaction was closed on February 11, 2021 following the regulatory and third-party approvals.
Following the closing of the transaction, HOT exercises a significant influence over IBC Israel, that is accounted
for under the equity method based on the provisions of IAS 28 (Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures).

_Portugal pre-retirement program_

In connection with an ongoing transformation process of the Group in Portugal, in a severe context resulting from
the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the Group companies in Portugal have launched a voluntary employee
reduction program in March 2021. This program is aimed at employees aged 50 years or more that decide to enroll
in the program, subject to the relevant company’s acceptance, who will have their employment agreements
terminated and will be entitled to receive a monthly fixed compensation up to retirement age corresponding to a
percentage of their previous remuneration. The deadline for employees to enroll in the program has finished in
the second quarter of 2021, but the selection process of the employees that will be allowed to terminate their
employment agreements under this pre-retirement scheme is still ongoing. As of March 31, 2021, management
considered that the conditions for recording a liability were met under IAS 19 Employee benefits and thus a
liability was recognized in the caption “provisions” in the statement of financial position and in the caption “other
(expense) and income” of the income statement for an amount of €241 million, relating to approximately 750
employees and corresponding primarily to the present value of salaries payable up to retirement age to the


-----

employees that agreed to terminate their employment agreements under pre-retirement schemes. Based on
information up to date, the Group expects to record an additional liability in the second quarter of 2021 relating
to approximately 200 employees.

_For the three months ended March 31, 2020:_

_Sale of 25% equity stake in OMTEL_

On January 2, 2020, the Group announced the sale of a 25% equity interest held by PT Portugal in Belmont Infra
Holding S.A. (“Belmont”), that owns 100% of the tower company OMTEL, to Cellnex. Total cash proceeds
amounted to €201 million. The net gain on sale of interest in associates recorded for the three months ended March
31, 2020 amounted to €98 million. The sale by PT Portugal of its 25% equity interest in Belmont was part of a
larger transaction pursuant to which Cellnex acquired 100% of the share capital of OMTEL. In September 2018,
at the time of sale of OMTEL to a consortium including Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and Horizon
Equity Partners, PT Portugal had reinvested €109 million for a 25% equity interest in OMTEL.

_Redemption of notes_

The Group undertook the following redemptions of notes since January 1, 2020:

   - On January 13, 2020, Altice Finco redeemed in full the then outstanding Altice Finco 2023 Notes, in an
aggregate principal amount of €250 million, in accordance with the indenture governing the Altice Finco
2023 Notes;

   - On February 10, 2020, Altice Finco redeemed in full the then outstanding Altice Finco 2024 Notes, in
an aggregate principal amount of $400 million, in accordance with the indenture governing the Altice
Finco 2024 Notes; and

   - On February 18, 2020, Altice Financing redeemed in full the then outstanding Altice Financing 2023
Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of €2,400 million equivalent, in accordance with the indenture
governing the Altice Financing 2023 Notes.

_Issuance of the Altice Financing 2028 Notes and Altice Financing 2025 Notes_

On January 22, 2020, Altice Financing issued (i) $1,200 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% Senior
Secured Notes due January 15, 2028, (ii) €1,100 million aggregate principal amount of 3.000% Senior Secured
Notes due January 15, 2028 (together, the “Altice Financing 2028 Notes”) and (iii) €600 million aggregate
principal amount of 2.250% Senior Secured Notes due January 15, 2025 (the “Altice Financing 2025 Notes”).

_Amendment of 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility_

On February 20, 2020, all of the lenders under the 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility Agreement agreed
to amend the 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to extend the maturity date to February 20,
2025, reduce the margin and make certain other changes.

_Bridge Facility_

On March 3, 2020, Altice Finco entered into a term loan credit agreement providing for, among other things, a
euro denominated term loan in an aggregate principal amount of €500 million (the “2020 Altice Finco Bridge
**Credit Facility”). The term loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the weighted average rate of two-**
month and three-month EURIBOR for the period between the funding date of the 2020 Altice Finco Bridge Credit
Facility (March 5, 2020) and the maturity date of the 2020 Altice Finco Bridge Credit Facility (May 29, 2020),
_plus the applicable margin of 2.5% per annum. The proceeds from the term loan borrowed under the 2020 Altice_
Finco Bridge Credit Facility were used to fund in part the redemption of the Altice Lux 2025 Notes. On April 17,
2020, Altice Finco fully repaid the 2020 Altice Finco Bridge Credit Facility.


-----

**Revenue**

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Group generated total revenues of €1,015 million, a 2.4% increase
compared to €991 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase in revenue was mainly the
consequence of positive performances in residential equipment, business services and media, which was partially
offset by a decrease in revenues from residential fixed and residential mobile. Revenue was also negatively
impacted by the unfavorable development of the foreign currency rate for NIS and DOP. NIS average exchange
rate decreased by 2.2% compared to the euro and DOP average exchange rate decreased by 18.2% compared to
the euro.

The tables below set forth the Group’s revenue by lines of activity in the various operating segments in which the
Group operates for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, respectively:

_Operating segments_

_Portugal: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Portugal generated revenue of €547 million, a 4.8%_
increase compared to €522 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

Revenue from Portugal’s fixed residential service increased by 6.0% from €155 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020 to €164 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in revenues is explained
by market share gains over the recent quarters and the higher contributions from high-value convergent package
fees, including migrations from customers being served by our DSL network to fiber.

Portugal’s mobile residential service business reported a net revenue decrease of 2.1% from €118 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020, to €115 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. This decline is
the consequence of lower pre-paid revenues, primarily driven by migrations to both post-paid and convergent
packages and lower roaming-out revenues, further impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of
which was partially offset by the increase in post-paid revenues.

Portugal reported a residential equipment revenue increase of 12.0% from €23 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020, to €26 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. This increase was largely driven by
the increasing commercial momentum after the opening of MEO shops from the end of the first quarter of 2021.


-----

Revenue from Portugal’s business services increased by 7.6% from €226 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020 to €243 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. This increase is primarily explained
by higher equipment sales from Altice Labs, equipment sales of laptops to schools and handsets to corporates.

_Israel: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Israel generated revenue of €247 million, a 0.3% increase_
compared to €247 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The negative effect of the COVID-19
pandemic on the revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2021 was higher compared to the corresponding
period in 2020 with two weeks of lockdown in the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to almost two
months of lockdown in the three months ended March 31, 2021. The lower reported growth rate in comparison to
the local currency growth rate is partially driven by the unfavorable development of the foreign currency rate for
NIS during the first quarter of 2021 in comparison to the first quarter of 2020.

On a local currency basis, revenue increased by 2.5%. Fixed residential service revenue decreased by 4.6%, which
was mainly driven by fierce competition in both fixed and mobile market. Mobile residential service revenue
decreased by 2.8% on a local currency basis due a stabilization in the mobile subscriber base and an increasing
price competition. Israel’s residential equipment revenue increased by 36.9% largely due to the increase in digital
sales channels as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic which was offset by the store closures. Business
services revenue increased by 28.2%, mainly due to the increase in B2B equipment sales.

_Dominican Republic: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Dominican Republic generated total_
revenue of €118 million, an 11.1% decrease compared to €133 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.
On a local currency basis, revenue increased by 5.1%. Therefore, the decrease in reported revenue was mainly
driven by the unfavorable development of the foreign currency rate for DOP. On a local currency basis, fixed
residential service revenue increased by 5.6% due to a growth in the subscriber base, stabilizing ARPU and
decrease in churn. Mobile residential service revenue grew by 2.6% due to an increase in prepaid and postpaid
subscriber base as a result of positive net additions. The Dominican Republic’s residential equipment revenue
increased by 15.5%, largely due to the reopening of shops and stands in the first three months of 2021. Business
services revenue grew by 8.0%, largely due to an increase in revenues from fixed television as a result of the
revenue generated pursuant to the contract for transmission of educational content with the Ministry of Education,
as well as internet driven by customers increased demand for higher capacity plans.

_Teads: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Teads generated revenue of €102 million, compared to €90_
million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in media revenue was mainly driven by a strong
first quarter for Teads in 2021, where several geographies contributed positively to the growth.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €371 million, a decrease
of 1.1% compared to €375 million for the three months ended 31, 2020. This decrease can be attributed to a higher
percentage increase in purchasing and subcontracting costs and staff costs and employee benefit expenses
compared to total revenue.

_Operating segments_

_Portugal: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Adjusted EBITDA in Portugal was €204 million, a_
decrease of 2.8% from €210 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease can be attributed
to a higher percentage increase in purchasing and subcontracting costs and staff costs and employee benefit
expenses, compared to total revenue. The increase in purchasing and contracting costs is mainly related to higher
cost of goods sold and higher raw materials consumption as a consequence the increase in residential equipment
and B2B equipment sales from Altice Labs. The increase in staff costs reflects primarily the effect of the
consolidation of Intelcia in the financial statements since March 2020. The decrease in other operating expenses
is primarily explained by lower sales and marketing costs, reflecting lower commercial activity due to the impacts
of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower call center expenses reflecting the internalization of some of these
operations in Intelcia, partially offset by higher provisions for bad debt and higher general and administration
expenses compared to pre-pandemic levels.

_Israel: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Adjusted EBITDA in Israel was €80 million, a decrease_
of 12.7% compared to €91 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Adjusted EBITDA on a local
currency basis decreased by 10.7% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in Adjusted


-----

EBITDA is largely attributable to an increase in cost of goods sold as a consequence of the increase in mobile
equipment related sales.

_Dominican Republic: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Adjusted EBITDA in the Dominican_
Republic decreased by 10.6% from €67 million for three months ended March 31, 2020 to €60 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 (an increase of 5.6% on a local currency basis). On a local currency basis,
the increase in Adjusted EBITDA is largely attributable to the reactivation of commercial activity and residential
customer base increase.

_Teads: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Adjusted EBITDA for Teads amounted to €29 million,_
compared to €9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, an increase of 240.7%. The increase is
explained by an increase in revenues and a reduction in operating expenses due to the renegotiation of contracts
with advertisers, lower marketing costs and lower travel and entertainment expenses as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic.

**Depreciation, amortization and impairment**

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, depreciation, amortization and impairment totaled €302 million,
stable compared to €303 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

**Other expenses and income**

For the three months period ended March 31, 2021, the Group’s other expenses totalled €245 million compared
to other income of €90 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. A detailed breakdown of other
expenses and income is provided below:

**Other expenses and (income) ...............................................................................................** **245** **(90)**

_Restructuring costs (including termination and employee benefit costs)_

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, termination and employee benefit costs of €241 million were
recognized as part of the pre-retirement program launched in March 2021.

_Net (gain)/loss on sale of interest in associates_

For the three months ended March 31, 2020, this related to the net gain on sale of interest in associates of €98
million from the sale of Portugal’s 25% equity stake in Belmont.

**Operating profit**

As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the Group recorded an operating loss of €145 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2021 compared to an operating profit of €195 million for the three months ended March
31, 2020.

**Finance income/(costs), net**

Net finance costs amounted to €33 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to finance income
of €494 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. A detailed breakdown of finance income/(costs), net
is provided below:


-----

**Finance income/(costs), net**
**(€m)**


**For the three months ended**
**March 31,**

**2021** **2020**


Interest relative to gross financial debt .......................................................................... (90) (140)

Net result on extinguishment of a financial liability ...................................................... — 590
**Finance income/(costs), net ..........................................................................................** **(33)** **494**

_Interest relative to gross financial debt_

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Group’s interest relative to gross financial debt totalled €90
million, a 35.8% decrease compared to €140 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease is
mainly explained by lower interest costs and a reduction in permanent debt related to various financing activities
in 2020.

_Realized and unrealized gains on derivative instruments_

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Group’s realized and unrealized loss on derivative instruments
totalled €127 million compared to a realized and unrealized gain on derivative instruments of €193 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease is mainly driven by foreign currency variations and floating
interest rate fluctuations related to the Group’s derivative financial instruments in Altice Financing.

_Other financial expenses_

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Group’s other financial expenses totalled €118 million compared
to €177 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This variation is mainly related to the decrease in the
foreign exchange loss due to the revaluation of U.S. Dollar denominated intercompany debt in the Dominican
Republic as at March 31, 2021.

_Finance income_

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Group’s other financial income totalled €48 million compared to
€28 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in other financial income is mostly explained
by an increase of interest income on interest bearing loans receivable from other Group companies and the
revaluation of Teads minority call option of €11 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020 which is nil
for three months ended March 31, 2021.

_Net result on extinguishment of a financial liability_

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Group’s net gain on extinguishment of a financial liability
amounted to nil, compared to a net gain on extinguishment of a financial liability of €590 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2020. The gain on extinguishment of financial liability for the three months ended March
31, 2020 was the result of the derecognition of the net present value of future interest payments for the AI
Mandatory Convertible Notes and redemptions of a portion of the Group’s debt in 2020.

**Share of gain/(loss) of associates**

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Group’s share of losses of associates totaled €5 million compared
to a loss of €1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

**Income tax benefit/(expense)**

The Group recorded an income tax benefit of €24 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, reflecting
an effective tax rate of 13% compared to an income tax benefit of €17 million for the three months ended March
31, 2020.


-----

**Profit/(loss) for the period**

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the loss after tax totaled €159 million compared to a profit after tax
of €704 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The reasons for this decrease are disclosed in the
sections above.

**_Significant Events Affecting Historical Results_**

Our results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019
were significantly impacted by the following events:

_For the year ended December 31, 2020_

_Sale of 25% equity stake in OMTEL_

On January 2, 2020, the Group announced the sale of 25% equity interest held by PT Portugal in Belmont, that
owns 100% in a tower company OMTEL, to Cellnex. Total cash proceeds amounted to €201 million. The net gain
on sale of interest in associates recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to €101 million.

The sale by PT Portugal of its 25% equity interest in Belmont was part of a larger transaction pursuant to which
Cellnex acquired 100% of the share capital of OMTEL. In September 2018, at the time of sale of OMTEL to a
consortium, including Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and Horizon Equity Partners, PT Portugal had
reinvested €109 million for a 25% equity interest in OMTEL.

_Closing of the partnership with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and the sale of 49.99% interest in_
_FastFiber (formerly Altice Portugal FTTH)_

On December 12, 2019, PT Portugal entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners
regarding the sale of a 49.99% interest in the Portuguese fiber business to be carved-out into a dedicated wholesale
vehicle, FastFiber (formerly Altice Portugal FTTH), comprising of the fiber passive infrastructure assets and rights,
related contracts and underlying agreements, thereby creating a nationwide fiber wholesaler in Portugal. On April
17, 2020, the transaction was closed and the Group received a cash consideration of €1,576 million for the sale of
49.99% of the share capital of FastFiber (€773 million) and for the sale of 49.99% of the existing intercompany
loan (€800 million), which was simultaneously converted into mandatory convertible notes. The proceeds from
the transaction were partly used to further deleverage the Group’s debt. Furthermore, the Group recorded a
receivable representing the net present value of an earn-out of €375 million due in December 2021. A second
earn-out is due in December 2026 subject to some performance conditions and the Group did not take into
consideration the second earn-out in the valuation of the purchase price and thus the capital gain recognized at
closing of the transaction. Following the closing of the transaction, PT Portugal continues to control and fully
consolidate FastFiber. The transaction resulted in the recognition of a non-controlling interest of €4 million and a
gain of €1,112 million in equity in the year ended December 31, 2020. FastFiber sells wholesale services to all


-----

operators at the same financial terms. MEO sells technical services to FastFiber for the construction, the subscriber
connection and the maintenance of its fiber network.

_Redemption of notes_

The Group undertook the following redemptions of notes since January 1, 2020:

   - On January 13, 2020, Altice Finco redeemed in full the then outstanding Altice Finco 2023 Notes, in an
aggregate principal amount of €250 million, in accordance with the indenture governing the Altice Finco
2023 Notes;

   - On February 10, 2020, Altice Finco redeemed in full the then outstanding Altice Finco 2024 Notes, in
an aggregate principal amount of $400 million, in accordance with the indenture governing the Altice
Finco 2024 Notes;

   - On February 18, 2020, Altice Financing redeemed in full the then outstanding Altice Financing 2023
Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of €2,400 million equivalent, in accordance with the indenture
governing the Altice Financing 2023 Notes;

   - Between June 4, 2020 and September 25, 2020, Altice Financing repurchased and cancelled the Altice
Financing 2026 Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to $279 million; and

   - On July 22, 2020, Altice Finco redeemed in full the then outstanding Altice Finco 2025 Notes in an
aggregate principal amount of $385 million (€333 million equivalent).

_Issuance of the Altice Financing 2028 Notes and Altice Financing 2025 Notes_

On January 22, 2020, Altice Financing issued the Altice Financing 2028 Notes and the Altice Financing 2025
Notes.

_Amendment of 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility_

On February 20, 2020, all of the lenders under the 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility Agreement agreed
to amend the 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to extend the maturity date to February 20,
2025, reduce the margin and make certain other changes.

_Bridge Facility_

On March 3, 2020, Altice Finco entered into a term loan credit agreement providing for, among other things, a
euro denominated term loan in an aggregate principal amount of €500 million (the “2020 Altice Finco Bridge
**Credit Facility”). The term loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the weighted average rate of two-**
month and three-month EURIBOR for the period between the funding date of the 2020 Altice Finco Bridge Credit
Facility (March 5, 2020) and the maturity date of the 2020 Altice Finco Bridge Credit Facility (May 29, 2020),
_plus the applicable margin of 2.5% per annum. The proceeds from the term loan borrowed under the 2020 Altice_
Finco Bridge Credit Facility were used to fund in part the redemption of the Altice Lux 2025 Notes. On April 17,
2020, Altice Finco fully repaid the 2020 Altice Finco Bridge Credit Facility.

_For the year ended December 31, 2019_

_Change in consolidation method in PHI_

In January 2019, HOT Mobile and Partner signed an amendment to the Network Sharing Agreement with respect
to the governance of the company PHI, effective on January 1, 2019. Following this amendment, the parties have
joint control over PHI (compared to significant influence before the amendment); accordingly, PHI is accounted
under the provisions of IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements) as a joint operation (recognition of HOT Mobile’s interests
in PHI’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses) instead of the equity method.


-----

_Sale of SIRESP by PT Portugal_

At the end of June 2019, PT Portugal entered into an agreement with the Portuguese State to transfer the ownership
of its shares in SIRESP’s share capital in December 2019. The transfer of ownership was completed on December
1, 2019. The net gain on sale of interest in associates recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted
to €1 million. The proceeds received amounted to €6 million.

**Revenue**

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group generated total revenues of €4,065 million, a 0.5% decrease
compared to €4,084 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in revenue was recorded in
residential mobile, residential equipment and business services, but partially offset by increases in residential fixed
and media services. Revenue was positively impacted by the favorable development of the foreign currency rate
for NIS, which average exchange rate increased by 1.7%. However, this favorable foreign currency impact was
partially offset by the adverse development of the average exchange rate of DOP, which decreased by 11.2%.

The tables below set forth the Group’s revenue by lines of activity in the various operating segments in which the
Group operates for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively:

**Total consolidated revenues ...** **2,107** **962** **561** **452** **2** **4,084**

Revenues for the Group’s residential fixed business increased to €1,288 million for the year ended December 31,
2020, a 0.7% increase compared to €1,279 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was
driven primarily by Portugal and Israel, as the residential fixed service revenue displayed a steady growth,
reflecting the sustained contribution of positive net adds. This increase, however, was partially offset by a decrease
in the Dominican Republic, which was largely driven by the adverse development of the average exchange rate
of DOP.

The Group’s revenue from residential mobile business decreased to €952 million for the year ended December 31,
2020, a 2.4% decrease compared to €975 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was
primarily driven by a decrease in prepaid revenue in the Dominican Republic, which was partially offset by an
increase in postpaid revenues due to a higher subscriber base and negatively impacted by the adverse development
of the average exchange rate of DOP. Residential mobile revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was also
negatively impacted by a decrease in roaming revenue year over year, as a result of a decrease in international
travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


-----

The Group’s residential equipment revenue decreased by 7.0% to €211 million for the year ended December 31,
2020, compared to €227 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly driven by the
closure of shops in the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Group’s business services revenue decreased to €1,141 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a 1.1%
decrease compared to €1,154 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly driven by
the Dominican Republic due to a decrease in roaming revenue year over year, as a result of a decrease in
international travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the adverse development of the average exchange
rate of DOP.

Revenue from the Group’s media activities totaled €477 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a 5.2%
increase compared to €453 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in media revenue was
mainly driven by a strong fourth quarter of Teads, after the second quarter and to a lesser extent the third quarter,
were impacted due to the severe slowdown of the global advertising market as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Operating segments_

_Portugal: For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group generated revenues in Portugal of €2,118 million, a_
0.5% increase compared to €2,107 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Revenues from Portugal’s residential fixed business increased by 1.5%, from €613 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €622 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is explained by the
sustained contribution of positive net adds and higher contributions from bundles, including migrations from DSL
to fiber, leading to higher revenues from internet and TV. This effect was partially offset by lower revenues from
sports premium channels because of their billing suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Portugal’s residential mobile business posted a net revenue decrease of 0.6%, from €469 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 compared to €466 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Postpaid revenue
increased in line with a continued increase in the customer base. However, this increase was offset by lower
prepaid service revenue, which was largely driven by the stay-at-home restrictions and lower roaming revenue as
a result of decreased international travel, both driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Revenues from Portugal’s residential equipment business decreased by 1.1%, from €109 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to €108 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was largely
driven by the closing of the MEO shops from the end of March 2020 until the beginning of May 2020 due to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Revenues from Portugal’s business services increased by 0.6%, from €919 million for the year ended December
31, 2019 to €925 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is mainly explained by higher
equipment sales, which compensated for a decrease in commercial activity in the second quarter of 2020 due to
the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Israel: For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group generated revenue in Israel of €981 million, a 1.9%_
increase compared to €962 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a local currency basis, revenue
increased by 0.2%. On a local currency basis, the fixed residential service revenue increased by 0.1%, which was
driven by a growth in the subscriber base, despite strong competition in the fixed market. Residential mobile
revenue increased by 4.5% on a local currency basis due to an increase in the mobile subscriber base, supportive
ARPU trends and the increased use of telecommunication services due to the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the
increasing price competition. Israel’s residential equipment revenue decreased by 9.1% largely due to the closure
of shops and booths at shopping malls due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Business revenue decreased by 0.8%,
mainly due to loss of B2B roaming revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic and loss of iDEN revenue as the
iDEN technology was decommissioned by the end of 2019. The increase in revenue on a reported basis was also
partially driven by the favorable development of the foreign currency rate for NIS during the first half of 2020,
although NIS depreciated in the second half year of 2020.

_Dominican Republic: For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group generated total revenue of €490 million_
in the Dominican Republic, a 12.7% decrease compared to €561 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
On a local currency basis, revenue decreased by 1.6%. On a local currency basis, fixed residential service revenue
increased by 1.6% due to a growth in the subscriber base but which was largely offset by a decrease in
reconnection and late payment fees due to government regulations. Residential mobile revenue increased by 0.5%,


-----

with a decrease in prepaid consumption largely offset by an increase in the postpaid subscriber revenues resulting
from an increased subscriber base. The Dominican Republic’s residential equipment revenue decreased by 9.6%,
largely due to the closure of shops due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lower subsidies on equipment sales.
Business services decreased by 7.5%, largely in wholesale revenue, mainly due to lower international voice traffic
and pricing. The decrease in revenue was also partially driven by the unfavorable development of the foreign
currency rate for DOP.

_Teads: For the year ended December 31, 2020, Teads generated revenue of €476 million, a 5.3% increase_
compared to €452 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenue was mainly driven by
a strong fourth quarter of Teads in 2020, after the second and third quarter were impacted due to the severe
slowdown of the global advertising market as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Adjusted EBITDA**

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA was €1,580 million, an increase of 2.0%
compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 (€1,548 million). This increase can be attributed mainly to lower
other operating expenses which offset the impact of lower revenue.

_Operating segments_

_Portugal: For the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA in Portugal was €834 million, an increase_
of 0.2% from €832 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA is largely
attributable to higher revenues and lower operating expenses but which were largely offset by higher purchasing
and contracting costs and staff costs and employee benefit expenses. The increase in purchasing and contracting,
mainly related to costs of goods sold, are in line with the decrease in revenue. The increase in other operating
expenses was driven by lower sales and marketing costs which reflect lower commercial activity during 2020 due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, lower energy costs as a result of the acquisition of a participation in MEO Energia
and lower call center expenses reflecting the internalization of certain call center activities, although this resulted
in higher staff costs and employee benefit expenses.

_Israel: For the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA in Israel was €354 million, a decrease of 1.5%_
compared to €359 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA on a local currency basis
decreased by 3.2% compared to 2019, which is mainly due to a decrease in high-margin revenue which was offset
by an increase in purchasing and contracting, in line with the higher revenue.

_Dominican Republic: For the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA in the Dominican Republic_
decreased by 13.8% from €278 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €240 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 (a decrease of 3.0% on a local currency basis). On a local currency basis, the decrease in
Adjusted EBITDA is largely attributable to the decrease in high-margin revenue and an increase in bad debt due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was partially offset by lower cost of sales in line with the lower revenue.

_Teads: For the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA for Teads amounted to €156 million, compared_
to €83 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 88.8%. The increase is explained by an
increase in revenues and a reduction in operating expenses due to the renegotiation of contracts with advertisers,
lower marketing costs and lower travel and entertainment expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Depreciation, amortization and impairment**

For the year ended December 31, 2020, depreciation and amortization totaled €1,206 million, a 4.0% decrease
compared to €1,256 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is largely driven by lower
depreciation in 2020 related to certain cable assets which were fully depreciated by the end of 2019.

**Other expenses and income**

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group’s other income totaled €59 million, a 116.1% increase compared
to an expense of €367 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. A detailed breakdown of other expenses
and income is provided below:

**Other expenses and (income) .....................................................................................** **(59)** **367**

_Restructuring costs_

For the year ended December 31, 2020, restructuring costs related to termination payments in connection with the
voluntary employee reduction program in PT Portugal. For the year ended December 31, 2019, restructuring costs
mainly related to restructuring plans in PT Portugal for which a €293 million expense, which will be tax deductible
upon payment, was recorded in connection with the voluntary employee reduction program undertaken in 2019,
covering approximately 850 employees (mainly in support functions) in order to improve operational flexibility
of PT Portugal.

_Net gain on sale of interest in associates_

For the year ended December 31, 2020, this mainly related to the net gain on sale of interest in associates of €101
million from the sale of PT Portugal’s 25% equity stake in Belmont.

**Operating profit**

As a result of the above-mentioned factors, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group recorded an
operating profit of €562 million compared to €57 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**Finance income/(costs), net**

**Finance income/(costs), net**
**(€m)**


**For the year ended December 31,**

**Finance income/(costs), net ...........................................................................................** **(100)** **(372)**

_Interest relative to gross financial debt_

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group’s interest relative to gross financial debt totaled €469 million,
a 22.7% decrease compared to €606 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is mainly
explained by lower interest following the refinancing activities in 2019 and in the first quarter of 2020 and
reduction of the average financial debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019.

_Realized and unrealized (losses)/gains on derivative instruments linked to financial debt_

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group’s realized and unrealized loss on derivative instruments linked
to financial debt totaled €230 million compared to a realized and unrealized gain on derivative instruments of
€147 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly driven by the variation in the mark to market of the
Group’s derivative financial instruments in Altice Financing.


-----

_Other financial expenses_

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group’s other financial expenses totaled €110 million, a 2.7% decrease
compared to €113 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Finance income_

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group’s finance income amounted to €338 million, a 61.7% increase
compared to €209 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due to the increase in
net foreign exchange gains and an increase of interest income on loans and receivables, which increased from
€1,598 million as of ended December 31, 2019 to €2,498 million as of December 31, 2020.

_Net result on extinguishment and remeasurement of financial liabilities_

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group’s net gain on extinguishment and remeasurement of financial
liabilities amounted to €371 million, compared to a net loss of €10 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The gain on extinguishment of a financial liability for the year ended December 31, 2020 relates to the
remeasurement of the net present value of future interest payments for the AI Mandatory Convertible Notes and
redemptions of the Group’s notes issued by Altice Financing and Altice Finco.

**Share of gain/(loss) of associates**

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group’s share in the result of associates totaled €3 million compared
to a loss of €7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**Income tax benefit/expense**

effective tax rate of 3% compared to an income tax expense of €117 million for the year ended December 31,
2019

**Profit/(loss) for the period**

**_Significant Events Affecting Historical Results_**

Our results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018
were significantly impacted by the following events:

_For the year ended December 31, 2019_

_Change in consolidation method in PHI_

In January 2019, HOT Mobile and Partner signed an amendment to the Network Sharing Agreement with respect
to the governance of the company PHI, effective on January 1, 2019. Following this amendment, the parties have
joint control over PHI (compared to significant influence before the amendment); accordingly, PHI is accounted
under the provisions of IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements) as a joint operation (recognition of HOT Mobile’s interests
in PHI’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses) instead of the equity method.

_Sale of SIRESP by PT Portugal_

At the end of June 2019, PT Portugal entered into an agreement with the Portuguese State to transfer the ownership
of its shares in SIRESP’s share capital in December 2019. The transfer of ownership was completed on December

as a result of an issuance of 43,546 new Class B Shares having a nominal value of €1 each, and the balance related
to the payment of Share Premium B.

_Closing of the sale of ACS and ATS France to Altice France_

On May 16, 2018, we completed the sale of ACS and ATS France to Altice France. Altice France acquired a 65%
interest in the capital of ACS from Altice International for a total consideration of €30 million. ACS comprises
mainly of companies of the Intelcia group, a French language-focused player in the customer relations
management outsourcing industry. The capital gain recorded in equity amounted to €3 million, net of tax.

Altice France also acquired a 100% interest in ATS France from Altice International for a total consideration of
€175 million. ATS France is an all-round technical services company offering among others network deployment,

On June 18, 2018, PT Portugal entered into an agreement with a consortium including Morgan Stanley
Infrastructure Partners and Horizon Equity Partners (the “Portuguese Tower Purchasers”) for the sale of 75%
of the shares in a newly incorporated tower company (“PT TowerCo”) comprising 2,961 sites operated by the
Group. The transaction valued PT TowerCo at an enterprise value of €660 million.

The transaction closed on September 4, 2018. The capital gain for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted
to €602 million, which consisted of (i) a capital gain of €612 million corresponding to the difference between the
purchase price of €648 million (including a cash consideration for the disposal of the 75% stake in the amount of
€540 million and the acquisition of 25% stake in OMTEL by PT Portugal measured at a fair value of €108 million)
and the carrying value of the net assets transferred, amounting to €37 million, including mainly the towers, prepaid
rents and asset retirement obligations and (ii) €10 million of deferred capital gain.

Revenues for the Group’s residential fixed business decreased from €1,342 million for the year ended December
31, 2018 to €1,290 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a 3.9% decrease compared to the year ended
December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven primarily by growing competition and the associated pricing
pressure in Israel and the sale of the FOT Business to Altice France on October 31, 2018.

The Group’s residential mobile business revenue decreased to €1,191 million for the year ended December 31,
2019, a 4.2% decrease compared to €1,244 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was
driven by the sale of the FOT Business to Altice France on October 31, 2018 but partially offset by an increase in
mobile residential revenues in Israel due to higher equipment sales and an increase in the mobile subscriber base
and a favorable foreign exchange impact, and in Portugal by an increase in post-paid customer base, although this
was partly offset by a loss of prepaid customers.

The Group’s business services revenue decreased to €1,154 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a 6.6%
decrease compared to €1,235 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven by the sale
of the FOT Business to Altice France on October 31, 2018, in addition to decreases in Portugal and the Dominican
Republic due to the sale of the international wholesale voice carrier business, a transaction which closed on
September 6, 2018, and lower international voice traffic.

Revenues from the Group’s media activities totaled €453 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a 22.2%
increase compared to €371 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was mainly due to
increases in Teads resulting from higher sales, which was partially offset by a reduction in revenues due to the
sale of Altice TV, which is no longer part of the Group following the sale to an affiliate of the Group on May 15,
2018. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by a favorable development of the foreign currency rates for
the Israeli Shekel and the Dominican Peso, which, based on the average exchange rate, increased by 5.9% and
1.7% respectively.

_Operating segments_

_Portugal: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group generated revenues in Portugal of €2,107 million, a_
marginal decrease compared to €2,108 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Revenues from the Group’s residential fixed business increased by 0.5% from €618 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to €622 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is explained by the
positive net adds reported during 2019, as compared to negative net adds during 2018, which was largely offset
by a decline in fixed ARPU due to competitive pressure.

The Group’s residential mobile business posted a net revenue increase of 1.3% from €562 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 compared to €569 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was
driven by an increase in postpaid customer base, which was partially offset by a higher loss of prepaid subscribers
in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.


-----

Revenues from the Group’s business services decreased by 1.1% from €929 million for the year ended December
31, 2018 to €919 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly explained by the sale
of the international wholesale voice carrier business, a transaction which closed on September 6, 2018, and lower
international voice traffic.

_Israel: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group generated revenue in Israel of €962 million, a 2.2%_
increase compared to €941 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is partially explained by the
favorable development of the foreign currency rate for the Israeli Shekel, which, based on the average exchange
rate, increased by 5.9%. On a local currency basis, revenues decreased by 3.9%, mainly due to a decrease in fixed
residential revenues as a result of a strong competition in the fixed market, despite an increase in cable customer
base in 2019. The decrease in the fixed market was partly offset by an increase in residential mobile revenues due
to higher equipment sales and an increase in the mobile subscriber base while the market is still under price
pressure. Business services continued to demonstrate high performance and steady growth in revenues, showing
an increase of 3.4% in 2019 compared to 2018 and an increase of 12.7% excluding iDEN revenues, which
commenced decommissioning by the end of 2018.

_Dominican Republic: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group generated total revenue of €561 million,_
a 4.9% decrease compared to €589 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was partially
mitigated by the favorable development of the foreign currency rate for the Dominican Peso, which, based on the
average exchange rate, increased by 1.7%. On a local currency basis, revenues decreased by 0.5%, which was
largely driven by a decrease in mobile residential revenues as a result of voice erosion, and a decrease in wholesale
revenues, mainly due to the sale of the international wholesale voice carrier business, a transaction which closed
on September 6, 2018, and lower international voice traffic.

_Teads: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group generated revenue in Teads of €452 million, compared_
to €341 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in revenues is explained by the commercial
success of newly introduced services and product formats, as well as the continued growth in the United States
and Asia-Pacific regions.

_Altice TV: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group generated total revenue in Altice TV of nil, compared_
to €25 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is explained by the sale of Altice TV, which
is no longer part of the Group following the sale to an affiliate of the Group on May 15, 2018.

_Others: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group generated total revenue in Others (which comprises of_
the Group’s corporate entities) of €2 million, compared to €180 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
This decrease is mainly explained by the sale of the FOT Business to Altice France on October 31, 2018.

**Adjusted EBITDA**

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA was €1,548 million, a decrease of 4.2%
compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (€1,616 million). This decrease can be attributed to lower revenues,
which were partially offset by lower operating expenses. To an extent these movements were driven by the sale
of Altice TV, which is no longer part of the Group following the sale to an affiliate of the Group on May 15, 2018
and the sale of the FOT Business to Altice France on October 31, 2018.

_Operating segments_

_Portugal: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA in Portugal was €832 million,_
a decrease of 4.3% from €870 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA
is largely attributable to an increase in expenses due to higher programming costs, mainly as a result of the
football-related broadcasting rights which were acquired in 2016 but which started to be broadcasted as from the
2018/2019 football season, higher costs of goods sold related to mobile handsets, which are in line with the higher
revenues, and an increase in infrastructure rental expenses due to the sale of the tower business and subsequent
lease of towers. The negative impact of these drivers on Adjusted EBITDA was only partially offset by (i) lower
international voice traffic costs, in line with the decline in associated business services revenues, (ii) lower
customer service expenses related to bad debt and billing expenses due to electronic invoice penetration and callcenter activities and (iii) lower staff costs and employee benefits due to the favorable impact related to employees
who terminated their employment agreements in March 2019 under the voluntary employee reduction program.


-----

_Israel: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA in Israel was €359 million, a_
decrease of 11.4% compared to €406 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA on a local
currency basis decreased by 16.7% compared to 2018, mainly due to a decrease in residential fixed revenues in
addition to an increase in purchasing and sub-contracting costs, mainly due to an increase in the cost of sale of
mobile handsets associated to an increase in mobile revenues, an increase in sport channel content expense, and
an increase in staff costs as a result of a new agreement with the labor unions.

_Dominican Republic: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA in the Dominican_
Republic decreased by 5.4% from €294 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €278 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019. On a local currency basis, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 7.5% due to the reduction
in business services revenues, mainly explained by the sale of the international wholesale voice carrier business,
a transaction which closed on September 6, 2018, and lower international voice traffic. In addition, network
operating costs increased due to network growth and due to the sale of the tower business and subsequent lease of
towers. Staff costs and employee benefits increased due to the increase in the average number of FTEs due to
additional sales and retention staff. These decreases in Adjusted EBITDA were partly offset by lower cost of sales
related to the international wholesale voice carrier business and lower international voice traffic.

_Teads: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for Teads amounted to €83 million,_
compared to €60 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 37.1%. The increase is explained
by higher revenues, as described above, but which were partly offset by higher other operating expenses, staff
costs and employee benefits.

_Altice TV: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for Altice TV is nil, compared_
to Adjusted EBITDA of €(75) million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change is explained by the sale
of Altice TV, which is no longer part of the Group following the sale to an affiliate of the Group on May 15, 2018.

_Others: For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA in Others was €(4) million,_
compared to a Adjusted EBITDA of €60 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is mainly
explained by the sale of the FOT Business to Altice France on October 31, 2018.

**Depreciation, amortization and impairment**

For the year ended December 31, 2019, depreciation and amortization totaled €1,256 million, a 10.1% increase
compared to €1,141 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is largely explained by the impact
of the adoption of IFRS 16 (Leases) as of January 1, 2019, which resulted in additional amortization expenses
relating to right-of-use assets in an amount of €100 million.

**Other expenses and income**

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s other expenses totaled €367 million, a 137.4% decrease
compared to other income of €983 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. A detailed breakdown of other

For the year ended December 31, 2019, this mainly related to the capital loss due to the purchase price adjustment
in PT Portugal of €2 million and the loss related to the sale of the international wholesale voice carrier business
to Tofane Global, which was partially offset by the gain from the sale of SIRESP of €1 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, this mainly related to the gain on the sale of the tower business in PT
Portugal of €602 million, the sale of telecommunications solutions business and data center operations in
Switzerland, green.ch AG and Green Datacenter AG and the sale of the wholesale business.

_Break-up fee_

operating profit of €57 million, a 96.1% decrease compared to an operating profit of €1,457 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018.

**Finance income/(costs), net**

Net finance costs amounted to €372 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to €384 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018. A detailed breakdown of finance income/(costs), net is provided below:

a 0.3% increase compared to €604 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Realized and unrealized (losses)/gains on derivative instruments_

instruments totaled €147 million, a 25.3% decrease compared to €196 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, mainly driven by the variation in the mark to market of the Group’s derivative financial instruments.

_Other financial expenses_

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group’s other financial expenses totaled €113 million, a 53.3%
decrease compared to €241 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change in other financial expenses
is largely driven by a decrease in foreign exchange losses (foreign exchange losses of nil for the year ended
December 31, 2019 compared to foreign exchange losses of €162 million for the year ended December 31, 2018).
This decrease was partially offset by interest expenses related to lease liabilities following adoption of IFRS 16

ended December 31, 2018.

million as costs of extinguishment of debt, of which €8 million pertaining to call premia and €2 million related to

gain of €5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

tax rate of 37%, compared to an income tax loss of €194 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting
an effective tax rate of 18%. The variation is explained mainly by the decrease in the profit/(loss) before income
tax and share of earnings of associates and joint ventures as well as change in the reassessment of tax losses and
deferred tax assets during 2019 and 2018.

**Profit/(loss) for the period**

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the loss for the year totaled €439 million compared to a profit for the year
of €903 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.

**Total Capital Expenditures**

We present Capital Expenditures (Accrued), Capital Expenditures (Working Capital Items) and Total Capital
Expenditures (equal to “payment to acquire tangible and intangible assets and contract costs” in our statement of
cash flows). For each definition, please see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS
_Measures”. The Group has made substantial investments and will continue to make Total Capital Expenditures in_
the geographies in which it operates to expand its footprint and enhance its product and service offerings. In
addition to continued investment in its infrastructure, the Group expects to continue to strategically invest in its
operating segments to enrich its differentiated and convergent communication services as well as to reduce churn
and increase ARPU. The Group expects to finance principal investments described below, to the extent they have
not been completed, with cash flow from its operations.

_Portugal: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Portugal’s Total Capital Expenditures were €114 million_
(representing 20.8% of revenue in Portugal), an 8.5% decrease compared to €125 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020 (representing 23.9% of revenue in Portugal). Capital Expenditures (Accrued) increased by
€7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 reflecting mainly higher network-related capital
expenditures due to investments in the mobile network and the acquisition of satellite capacity. Capital
Expenditures (Working Capital Items) decreased by €18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 in
relation to March 31, 2020 due to phasing of capital expenditures.

_Israel: Total Capital Expenditures for Israel amount to €71 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021_
(representing 28.7% of revenue in Israel) compared to €61 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020
(representing 24.7% of revenue in Israel). On a local currency basis, Total Capital Expenditures increased by
17.6%, which was mainly driven by fixed customer and installation capital expenditure, in preparation of the
launch of the fiber commercial offers and network investments due to new deployment and rerouting projects.

_Dominican Republic: For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Total Capital Expenditures were €20 million_
(representing 17.0% of revenue in the Dominican Republic), a 40.5% decrease compared to €34 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 (representing 25.6% of revenue in the Dominican Republic). On a local


-----

currency basis, Total Capital Expenditures decreased by 29.7%, mainly driven by a decrease in mobile network
related capex due to phasing of Mobile Rollout and an improved network planning.

_Teads: In general, Teads has limited Total Capital Expenditures due to the nature of its business._

**_Year Ended December 31, 2020 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019_**

The table below sets forth the reconciliation of Capital Expenditures (Accrued) and Capital Expenditures
(Working Capital Items) to Total Capital Expenditures (i.e., payment to acquire tangible and intangible assets and

_Operating segments_

_Portugal: For the year ended December 31, 2020, PT Portugal’s Total Capital Expenditures were €478 million_
(representing 22.6% of revenue in Portugal), an 11.2% increase compared to €430 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 (representing 20.4% of revenue in Portugal). The increase in Total Capital Expenditures is
explained by an increase in network-related capital expenditures due to the fiber roll-out program, in addition to
an increase in Capital Expenditures (Working Capital Items).

_Israel: Total Capital Expenditures in Israel were stable with €251 million (representing 26.1% of revenue in Israel)_
for the year ended December 31, 2019 and €252 million (representing 25.7% of revenue in Israel) in the year
ended December 31, 2020. On a local currency basis, Total Capital Expenditures decreased by 1.3%, which was
mainly driven by network upgrades during the second quarter of 2020, which was offset by a change in Capital
Expenditures (Working Capital Items).

_Dominican Republic: For the year ended December 31, 2020, Total Capital Expenditures were €93 million_
(representing 19.0% of revenue in the Dominican Republic), a 19.9% decrease compared to €116 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 (representing 20.7% of revenue in the Dominican Republic). On a local currency
basis, Total Capital Expenditures decreased by 9.8%, mainly due to lower investments in customer premise
equipment in addition to a change in Capital Expenditures (Working Capital Items).

_Teads: In general, Teads has limited Total Capital Expenditures due to the nature of its business._

_Portugal: For the year ended December 31, 2019, PT Portugal’s Total Capital Expenditures were €430 million_
(representing 20.4% of revenue in Portugal), a 6.5% decrease compared to €460 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 (representing 21.8% of revenue in Portugal). The Capital Expenditures (Accrued) increased
due to higher network investments, but were offset by lower mobile network related capital expenditures due to
the completion of the Mobile Access Network Transformation Project - Single RAN during 2018 and a decrease
in Capital Expenditures (Working Capital Items).

_Israel: Total Capital Expenditures in Israel increased by 3.6%, from €243 million (representing 25.8% of revenue_
in Israel) in the year ended December 31, 2018 to €251 million (representing 26.1% of revenue in Israel) in the
year ended December 31, 2019. On a local currency basis, Total Capital Expenditures decreased by 2.6%, which
was mainly driven by a decrease in network and call center investments and local content production, which was
partially offset by higher capitalization of commissions and changes in Capital Expenditures (Working Capital
Items).

_Dominican Republic: For the year ended December 31, 2019, Total Capital Expenditures were €116 million_
(representing 20.7% of revenue in the Dominican Republic), a 3.8% increase compared to €112 million for the
year ended December 31, 2018 (representing 18.9% of revenue in the Dominican Republic). On a local currency
basis, Capital Expenditures (Accrued) increased by 1.4%, mainly due to higher CPE and installation spend, which
was partially offset by changes in Capital Expenditures (Working Capital Items).

_Teads: In general, Teads has limited Total Capital Expenditures due to the nature of its business._

_Altice TV: For the year ended December 31, 2019, Total Capital Expenditures were nil, compared to €8 million_
for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is explained by the sale of Altice TV, which is no longer
part of the Group following the sale to an affiliate of the Group on May 15, 2018.


-----

_Others: For the year ended December 31, 2019, Total Capital Expenditures were nil, compared to €36 million for_
the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is mainly explained by the sale of the FOT Business to Altice
France on October 31, 2018.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_General_**

The Group’s principal sources of liquidity are (i) operating cash flow generated by the Group’s subsidiaries and
(ii) various revolving credit facilities and guarantee facilities that are available to the Group, for any requirements
not covered by the operating cash flow generated. As of March 31, 2021, our consolidated cash and cash
equivalents amounted to €302 million on an actual basis. Each of our operating subsidiaries maintains cash and
cash equivalents to fund their day-to-day requirements.

Our most significant financial obligations are our debt obligations. As of March 31, 2021, as adjusted for the
Refinancing Transactions, including the offering of the Notes hereby and the application of the proceeds therefrom,
the Group had total third-party financial debt (after currency impact of derivative instruments) as presented under
“Capitalization” of €7,690 million.

 - Excludes the Altice Financing Guarantee Facilities

The terms of our debt instruments contain certain restrictions, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur
additional debt. As a result, additional debt financing is only a potential source of liquidity if the incurrence of
any new debt is permitted by the terms of our existing debt instruments.


-----

**_Sources of Liquidity_**

Our principal source of liquidity is expected to be the operating cash flows of our operating subsidiaries and, if
required, borrowings under the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the Group has an aggregate of €393.2 million (equivalent) available borrowings under the 2014
Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility and the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, of which €110 has
been drawn. We expect to use these sources of liquidity to fund operating expenses, working capital requirements,
capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other liquidity requirements that may arise from time to time.
Further, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Group had access to the Altice Financing Guarantee
Facilities allowing for requests for guarantees to be issued up to a maximum of €139.5 million. As of the date of
this Offering Memorandum, Altice Financing has made requests for guarantees of up to €131.5 million in
aggregate principal amount to be issued under the Altice Financing Guarantee Facilities, which represents a
contingent liability of the Group. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Altice Financing Guarantee
_Facilities”. The availability of borrowings under the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities and the Altice_
Financing Guarantee Facilities is conditioned upon compliance with specified leverage ratios. Our ability to
generate cash from our operations will depend on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent,
to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which
are beyond our control. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, the cash provided from the operations of
our operating subsidiaries and any available borrowings under the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities
will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures, and debt service
requirements during the next 12 months, although no assurance can be given that this will be the case. However,
as our debt matures in later years, we anticipate that we will seek to refinance or otherwise extend our debt
maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to complete such refinancing transactions or otherwise
extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it is not possible to anticipate how economic conditions, sovereign debt
concerns and/or any adverse regulatory developments could impact the credit markets we access and accordingly,
our future liquidity and financial position. In addition, sustained or increased competition, particularly in
combination with adverse economic or regulatory developments, could have an unfavorable impact on our cash
flows and liquidity.

The debt issued by the Group is subject to certain restrictive covenants. Other than the Altice Financing Revolving
Credit Facilities and the Altice Financing Guarantee Facilities, described below, such debt issued by the Group is
subject to incurrence based covenants, which do not require ongoing compliance with financial ratios, but place
certain limitations on the relevant restricted group’s ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional
debt (including to finance new acquisitions), create liens, pay dividends and other distributions to shareholders or
prepay subordinated indebtedness, make investments, sell assets, engage in affiliate transactions or engage in
mergers or consolidations. These covenants are subject to several important exceptions and qualifications.

To be able to incur additional debt under an applicable debt instrument, the relevant restricted group must either
meet the ratio test described below (on a pro forma basis for any contemplated transaction giving rise to the debt
incurrence) or have available capacity under a general debt basket or meet certain other exceptions to the limitation
on indebtedness covenant in such debt instrument.

Senior secured debt and senior debt of the Group is subject to the following incurrence tests:

Senior secured debt of the Group is subject to an incurrence test of 3:1 (L2QA Adjusted EBITDA to net secured
debt) and senior debt is subject to an incurrence test of 4:1 (L2QA Adjusted EBITDA to net debt), as each term
is defined in the Altice Financing Indentures and Altice Finco Indentures, respectively.

Altice International and its relevant subsidiaries are allowed to fully consolidate the EBITDA from any
subsidiaries in which they have a controlling interest and that are contained in the restricted group as defined in
the relevant debt instruments.

The Group has access to the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities and the Altice Financing Guarantee
Facilities, which are subject to maintenance covenants. The incurrence covenants terms of the Altice Financing
Revolving Credit Facilities are no more restrictive than the incurrence covenants contained in other debt
instruments.

The Issuer is a holding company with no direct source of operating income. Therefore, the Issuer will be dependent
on payments from its operating subsidiaries under certain proceeds loans to meet its liquidity requirements. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure”.

**_Current assets and liabilities including Working Capital_**

As of March 31, 2021, the Group had net current liability position of €580 million (mainly due to trade and other
payables amounting to €1,339 million) and a positive Working Capital in an amount of €162 million. Net current
liability position as of March 31, 2021 consists of total current assets in an amount of €2,127 million and total
current liabilities in an amount of €(2,707) million in the statement of financial position. Working Capital as of
March 31, 2021 is calculated as: inventories in an amount of €128 million plus trade and other receivables in an
amount of €1,373 million less trade and other payables in an amount of €1,339 million.

As of December 31, 2020, the Group had a net current liability position of €561 million (mainly due to trade and
other payables amounting to €1,413 million) and a positive Working Capital in an amount of €163 million. Net
current liability position as of December 31, 2020 consist of total current assets in an amount of €2,195 million
and total current liabilities in an amount of €(2,756) million in the statement of financial position. Working Capital
as of December 31, 2020 is calculated as: inventories in an amount of €119 million plus trade and other receivables
in an amount of €1,416 million less trade and other payables in an amount of €1,413 million.

A net current liability position is structural and follows industry norms. Customers generally pay subscription
revenues early or mid-month, with short days of sales outstanding, and suppliers are paid in the beginning of the
following month, thus generating a negative net current liability position. Payables due the following month are
generally covered by operating cash flow. We expect that our operating cash flows and, if required, available
borrowings under the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities will be sufficient to meet our Working Capital
requirements during the next 12 months.

**Selected Consolidated Cash Flow Data**

**_Three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020_**

The following table presents primary components of the Group’s cash flows (net) for the three months ended
March 31, 2021and March 31, 2020, respectively.


**Net Cash Flows**

**Net changes in cash and cash equivalents .....................................................** **(52)** **(163)**

The Group recorded a net decrease of €52 million in cash and cash equivalents for the three months ended March
31, 2021, compared to a net decrease of €163 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 9.0% to €376 million for the three months ended March
31, 2021 compared to €345 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in net cash provided
by operating activities, on a recurring business basis, is largely explained by an increase in working capital from
€25 million working capital investment for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €12 million working capital
inflow for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

_(used in)_

Net cash used in investing activities was €252 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to
net cash used in investing activities of €545 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021 the cash used in investing activities consisted mainly of €206 million
of payments to acquire tangible and intangible assets and contract costs and a €45 million payment related to the
acquisition of 23.3% stake in IBC Israel. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, the cash used in investing
activities related to €222 million of payments to acquire tangible and intangible assets and contract costs, and a


-----

payment of €527 million upstreamed by the Group to Altice Lux which was offset by €201 million proceeds for
the sale of Portugal’s 25% equity stake in Belmont.

Net cash used in financing activities increased to €180 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021,
compared to net cash received from financing activities of €40 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021 the cash provided by financing activities consisted mainly of €142
million of interest paid on long term gross debt. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, the cash used in
financing activities consisted mainly of (i) net of proceeds and redemptions relating to refinancing activities which
resulted in a net inflow of cash of €336 million, (ii) interest paid of €202 million and (iii) €62 million of cash used
as a result of call premia and transaction costs related to the redemptions of the Altice Financing 2023 Notes,
Altice Finco 2024 Notes and the Altice Finco 2025 Notes which occurred during the three months ended March
31, 2020.

(*) For the year ended December 31, 2020, advances paid to Group companies are included in ‘net cash provided by/(used in) investing
activities’ and the comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in the 2020 Financial Statements (as
reflected in the table above) have been restated by reclassifying the amount of €64 million from ‘net cash provided by/(used in)
financing activities of continuing operations’ to ‘net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities’, corresponding to advances
paid to other Altice entities. The figures provided in the 2019 Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 are as
follows and have not been restated: net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities of continuing operations €(757 million) and
net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities €(795 million).

The Group recorded a net decrease of €42 million in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31,
2020, compared to a net decrease of €202 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities:_

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 8.3% to €1,477 million for the year ended December 31,
2020 compared to €1,364 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net cash provided by
operating activities is largely explained by an increase of the operating profit for the year ended December 31,
2020 and a decrease in the income tax paid compared to income tax paid during the year ended December 31,
2019. These increases in net cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by an increase in negative
changes in Working Capital.

_Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities:_

Net cash used in investing activities amounted to €1,549 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared
to cash used in investing activities of €859 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash
used by investing activities is largely explained by the increase of the advances paid to affiliated companies during
the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was partially offset by higher proceeds related to sale of interests
in associates of €201 million, largely due to the sale of Portugal’s 25% equity stake in Belmont.

_Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities:_

Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities increased to net cash provided by financing activities of €47
million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash used in financing activities of €694 million


-----

for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities can be largely
attributed to the proceeds related to the sale of the 49.99% interest in the Portuguese FTTH business to Morgan
Stanley Infrastructure Partners of €1,576 million, a transaction which was completed on April 17, 2020. These
increases were partially offset by higher cash outflows related to refinancing activities. During the year ended
December 31, 2020, refinancing activities resulted in a net outflow of cash of €823 million, whereas for the year
ended December 31, 2019 a net cash outflow of €19 million was recorded. In addition, cash advances with group
companies decreased from proceeds of €69 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 to payments of €72
million during the year ended December 31, 2020.

(*) For the year ended December 31, 2020, advances paid to Group companies are included in ‘net cash provided by/(used in) investing
activities’ and the comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in the 2020 Financial Statements have been
restated by reclassifying the amount of €64 million from ‘net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities of continuing
operations’ to ‘net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities’, corresponding to advances paid to other Altice entities. The
figures provided in the 2019 Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 (as reflected in the table above) are as
follows and have not been restated: net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities of continuing operations €(757 million) and
net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities €(795 million).

The Group recorded a net decrease of €202 million in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31,
2019, compared to a net increase of €344 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities:_

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 1.4% to €1,364 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 compared to €1,345 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The net cash provided by operating
activities increased due to a positive change in Working Capital and other non-cash items which was offset by the
decrease in the operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the operating profit for the
year ended December 31, 2018, and an increase in payment for pension liabilities and income taxes.

_Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities:_

Net cash from investing activities decreased by 233.6% to net cash used in investing activities of €795 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net cash from investing activities of €595 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the cash used by investing activities is mainly attributed to the proceeds
received from the disposal of businesses during 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, proceeds from
the disposal of businesses included €540 million related to the sale of the tower business in Portugal, €157 million
regarding the sale of the telecommunications solutions business and data center operations in Switzerland, €149
million regarding the sale of the tower business in the Dominican Republic and €14 million regarding the sale of
the wholesale business in Portugal and the Dominican Republic. In addition it includes the proceeds for the sales
of ATS France, ACS and FOT Business to Altice France for €178 million, €66 million and €481 million,
respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities due to these proceeds from the disposal of businesses
was only partially offset by lower payments to acquire interests in associates.

_Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities:_

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by 52.4% to net cash used in financing activities of €757 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net cash used in financing activities of €1,591 million for the
year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities can largely be attributed to
lower advances to Group companies and transactions with non-controlling interests during the year ended
December 31, 2019, and refinancing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, refinancing activities


-----

resulted in a net outflow of cash of €19 million, whereas for the year ended December 31, 2018 there was a net
outflow of cash of €358 million. These decreases in cash outflows were partially offset by increases in cash paid
for lease liabilities. The adoption of IFRS 16 (Leases) as per January 1, 2019, resulted in lease payment and the
interest related payments for right-of-use of €159 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, operating
lease payments were included in net cash provided by operating activities.

**Unrecognized Contractual Commitments**

We have other contractual obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, including commitments relating
to building or upgrading network infrastructure, purchase of set-top boxes, modems, mobile handsets and other
end-user equipment and various maintenance and support contracts primarily relating to the maintenance and
support of network infrastructure and equipment, purchase commitments for content, royalty payments to
regulatory authorities and authors’ rights to societies and commitments under interconnection contracts.

**Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution Pension Plans**

In addition, we have obligations under defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. Our cash outflow
relating to these obligations will vary depending on many factors. In the case of defined benefit plans, we have
recognized a liability regarding employee benefits in the statement of financial position of Altice International
which represents the present value of the defined benefits liability less the fair value of the plan assets, and the
past service costs. The liability in respect of defined benefit plans is determined using actuarial valuations. The
actuarial valuation involves making assumptions with regards to, among others, discount rates, expected rates of
return on assets, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such
estimates are subject to uncertainty. Actuarial gains and losses are reflected in the statement of income and
statement of other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise, as part of the salary costs. Deposits in
a defined contribution plan in respect of severance pay or in respect of emoluments are recognized as an expense
at the time of the deposit in the plan, in parallel to the receipt of the labor services from the employee and no
additional provision is recognized in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, our present value of
defined benefit obligations were €958 million.

**Off Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or
future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources, other than handset receivables factoring facility in
Israel for a net amount of €42 million utilized as of March 31, 2021 (out of total available facility of €56 million),
the contractual commitments relating to purchase of property, plant and equipment or as disclosed herein or in the
notes to the Historical Consolidated Financial Information.

**Post-Balance Sheet Date Events**

For a description of material post-balance sheet date events applicable to the Group, see “General Description of
_Our Business and the Offering—Recent Developments” included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._


-----

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

We are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, primarily as
between the U.S. dollar, euro, NIS and the DOP, and use financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest
rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

**_Credit Risk_**

The Group does not have significant concentrations of credit risk. Credit risk may arise from the exposures of
commitments under a number of financial instruments with one counterparty or as the result of commitments with
a number of groups of debtors with similar economic characteristics, whose ability to meet their commitments
could be similarly affected by economic or other changes.

The Group’s income mainly derives from customers in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic. The Group
regularly monitors its customers’ debts and provisions for doubtful debts are recorded in the consolidated financial
statements, which provide a fair value of the loss that is inherent to debts whose collection lies in doubt.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which manages liquidity
risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously
monitoring forecasted and actual cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group has a strong track record of driving operating free cash flow generation. As all external debt is issued
and managed centrally, the Group has a significant amount of control and visibility over the payments required to
satisfy obligations under the various tranches of its existing debt.

Additionally, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum the Group had access to the Altice Financing Revolving
Credit Facilities which provide for borrowings of up to €393.2 million (of which €110 million has been drawn) to
cover any liquidity needs not met by operating cash flow generation. Further, as of March 31, 2021 the Group had
access to the Altice Financing Guarantee Facilities allowing for requests for guarantees to be issued up to a
maximum of €139.5 million. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Altice Financing has made requests
for guarantees of up to €131.5 million in aggregate principal amount to be issued under the Altice Financing
Guarantee Facilities. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Sources of Liquidity”.

**_Interest Rate and Related Risk_**

For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our
earnings or cash flows. Accordingly, interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a
significant effect on the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt at maturity. On a
consolidated basis, taking into account our swap portfolio, our primary fixed rate debt obligations were in an
amount equivalent to €5,692 million, while our primary floating rate debt obligations were equivalent to
€1,759 million, in each case as of March 31, 2021.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

Our business is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. HOT’s primary transactional currency is the
NIS. Altice Dominicana’s primary transactional currency is the DOP. The primary transactional currency of the
Issuer and its other operating subsidiaries is the euro. We conduct, and will continue to conduct, transactions in
currencies other than such primary transactional currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar. Our existing third party
debt is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and euro although the amounts incurred in U.S. dollars and euro do
not necessarily match the amount we earn in the corresponding currency. We seek to manage such transactional
foreign currency exposures though our hedging policy in accordance with our specific business needs.

As part of its financial risk management strategy, the Group has entered into certain hedging operations relating
to its existing debt. These are split mainly into either fixed-to-fixed or floating-to-floating cross-currency and
interest rate swaps that cover against foreign currency and interest rate risk, foreign-exchange forwards that cover
against foreign exchange risk only, or interest rate swaps covering interest rate risk only. For details regarding the
Group’s outstanding derivative instruments to secure foreign currency liabilities and to reduce foreign currency
exposure, see Note 17.4 to the 2020 Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates**

For details regarding the Group’s critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates, see Note 2 to the 2020
Financial Statements.

**Related Party Transactions**

Other than as disclosed in this Offering Memorandum and in the notes to the Historical Consolidated Financial
Information, the Group did not have any material transactions with related parties during the three months ended
March 31, 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and 2018. See “Certain Relationships and
_Related Party Transactions”._

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW**

**Introduction**

We primarily provide cable and fiber-based services comprising high-quality pay television, high- speed
broadband internet, fixed-line and mobile telephony to residential customers, and, in certain countries, mobile and
fixed-line enterprise telecom services to corporate and government customers. Through Teads, we also operate a
cloud-based, end-to-end advertising technology platform. Across geographies, we benefit from an attractive
competitive environment given the superiority of the services we can provide through our cable and fiber networks,
in which we have significantly invested, as well as our advanced mobile networks. This has enabled us to
(1) develop strong positions in multiple play segments as selling various services as part of bundles has become a
growing trend in the markets in which we operate and (2) grow our market share in mobile telephony across our
markets (Portugal, Israel, Dominican Republic and other geographies).

_Pay Television_

Cable is the leading platform to distribute pay television in Western Europe and the United States, with a few
exceptions, for example in Italy where cable has not been introduced. Technologies that compete with cable
include satellite, Internet Protocol television (“IPTV”), OTT television and digital terrestrial television (“DTT”).
We believe that cable has certain advantages over these technologies, notably in terms of availability of interactive
features, image quality and number of channels. Cable is only matched in quality by IPTV and OTT television
when these technologies are delivered over fiber-to-the-home (“FTTH”) networks. FTTH networks benefit from
substantial bandwidth capabilities that are able to cope with the simultaneous provision of high-speed broadband
and high-definition television services.

Satellite operators distribute digital signals nationally via satellite directly to television viewers. To receive
programming distributed via satellite, viewers require a satellite dish, a satellite receiver and a set top box. Pay
television services provided via satellite typically require the viewers to use a conditional access smart card.
Satellite distribution has certain competitive advantages over cable television services, including a broader range
of programs available to a wider geographic area. However, given the lack of an integrated return path, satellite
struggles to deliver easy to handle interactive television services, including VoD services, to subscribers who do
not have a broadband internet connection. We believe that satellite has the following additional competitive
disadvantages compared to cable: (i) higher up front cost of procuring and installing a satellite dish needed to
receive programming, as compared to the “plug and play” convenience of cable television; (ii) absence of an
ongoing maintenance service, which cable network operators can offer to their subscribers; (iii) satellite providers
of “free to air” satellite services typically do not have strong relationships with the viewers using their service as
they do not receive subscription or other fees from them; and (iv) vulnerability of satellite reception to external
interference, such as adverse weather conditions.

DTT based pay television packages benefit from the wide coverage of the terrestrial platform but suffer from the
structurally limited number of channels available on DTT and the lack of interactive features that can be provided
through cable services. Consequently, the success of pay DTT has been limited, even in geographies where free
DTT is the primary television platform.

IPTV and OTT television are highly attractive ways of providing television content except when they rely on
digital subscriber line (“DSL”) networks. IPTV and OTT television that rely on DSL networks present a number
of disadvantages compared to cable. For example, adding television services over a DSL network strains the
network and decreases the amount of capacity available for other service offerings, particularly bandwidth
intensive broadband internet. Under currently available technology, we believe that DSL based triple-play
providers will have difficulty providing the same level of services that can be provided over fiber networks (in
particular, for HDTV, viewing of TV and VoD on multiple screens or TV and VoD simultaneous viewing and
recording) without having to make significant investments in extending fiber closer to the subscriber’s home.
When such investments in fiber are made, notably through FTTH networks, IPTV and OTT television are able to
offer high quality television to viewers.

Compared to DTH services provided via cable and FTTH networks are characterized by easy to use technology,
the efficient installation of customer equipment and the reliability of a protected signal delivered directly to the
home. Given the trend towards offering bundled media and telecommunications services, the market share of pay
television distribution is expected to benefit from cable and fiber’s ability to deliver triple-play services with high
bandwidth, high-speed and bi-directional capacity. Compared to standalone DTH, namely without a broadband


-----

internet connection, the number of advantages of bi-directional capabilities of digital cable television are
substantial for both the users and the cable operator. Digital cable subscribers can order VoD products and use
interactive television while the cable operator is able to track usage patterns and enable their customers, the
television channels, to target advertising to customers more efficiently.

_Broadband Internet_

The main broadband internet access technologies are DSL and cable, with DSL being the leading platform in a
number of countries for historical reasons, since internet access was initially provided on telephony copper lines;
however is now increasingly provided on FTTH networks. We believe that the increasing demand for very-highspeed broadband internet to cope with advanced applications, such as multi-screen and multimedia, that require
higher bandwidth and greater download speeds offer a sizable growth opportunity for cable- and fiber-based
technologies in the near term. Furthermore, we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the expected
continued growth of the demand for very high speed internet, given that cable networks enable us to offer
download speeds of at least 100 Mbps to a majority of homes passed in our footprint outside of the Dominican
Republic and our cable and fiber-based networks will be able to handle the increased demand with limited
additional upgrades. In contrast, many DSL based operators in some of the geographies where we operate would
need to make substantial investments in fiber to meet customer needs; however it is possible, in some coverage
areas, to upgrade DSL networks to fiber for a limited cost.

The existing DSL infrastructure offers consumers significantly lower speeds compared to cable maximum speeds
of up to approximately 300 Mbps on US DOCSIS 3.0, 360 Mbps on Euro DOCSIS 3.0 and up to 1 Gbps on FTTH
networks. For most users, the actual speed provided by DSL is lower than the advertised maximum speed as the
speed is dependent on the distance between end-users’ premises and DSL hubs. Furthermore, the maximum
download speed of DSL networks has to be shared between broadband internet and competing simultaneous users
of the line, such as IPTV. According to the “Quality of Broadband Services in the EU” report by the EC (published
in October 2014 and updated as of 9 March 2021), cable and FTTx services achieved 86.5% and 83% of advertised
download speeds, respectively, while DSL based services achieved only 63.3% of advertised download speed.

A substantial challenge facing the expansion of FTTH or Fiber-to-the-Building (FTTB) is that introducing such
technology is capital and time intensive and requires significant digging and rewiring, with the exception of certain
areas and buildings where upgrades can be performed at a limited cost.

Unlike DSL, cable networks are able to deliver consistent speeds irrespective of the distance to the customer. We
are currently able to offer download speeds of at least 100 Mbps to a majority of homes passed in our footprint
outside of the Dominican Republic.

The DOCSIS 3.1 standard, which is being developed by CableLabs, is a new DOCSIS specification enabling
higher spectral efficiency support of up to 10 Gbps downstream and 1 Gbps upstream speeds. DOCSIS 3.1 is
expected to work on existing HFC plant and be backwardly compatible with previous DOCSIS standards. This
double backward compatibility will allow a smooth migration strategy and no plant changes required to deploy
DOCSIS 3.1 equipment. Furthermore, limited investment will be needed to further maximize the capacity in the
future.

Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line 2 (“VDSL2”) is the latest and most advanced technology for DSL
broadband internet wireline communications. It was originally designed to support the wide deployment of tripleplay services such as voice, video, data, HDTV and interactive gaming and was intended to enable operators and
carriers to gradually, flexibly, and cost efficiently upgrade existing xDSL infrastructure. VDSL2 allows the
transmission of asymmetric and symmetric aggregate data rates of up to 200 Mbps downstream and upstream on
twisted pairs using a bandwidth up to 30 MHz and further, allows for significantly lower signal deterioration
caused by the distance between the cabinet and the customer’s premises when compared to older DSL
technologies. VDSL2 enabled networks could theoretically allow for up to 100 Mbps at 0.4 kilometers, 40 to 50
Mbps at 0.7 kilometer and approximately 30 Mbps at 1 kilometer.

On 9 March 2021, the European Commission presented a vision for Europe’s digital transformation by 2030: “The
Digital Compass”. This vision for the EU's digital decade revolves around four main areas with specific targets
for 2030: (i) Secure and sustainable digital infrastructures, (ii) Skills, (iii) Digital transformation of businesses
and (iv) Digitalisation of public services.


-----

Excellent and secure connectivity for everybody and everywhere in Europe is a prerequisite for a society in which
every business and citizen can fully participate. The ambition for the Secure and sustainable digital infrastructures
area is that by 2030: (i) all European households are covered by a Gigabit network, and (ii) all populated areas are
covered by 5G.

This vision relies on three main strategic objectives for 2025: (i) Gigabit connectivity for all of the main socioeconomic drivers, (ii) uninterrupted 5G coverage for all urban areas and major terrestrial transport paths, and (iii)
access to connectivity offering at least 100 Mbps for all European households.

_Fixed-line Telephony_

Traditional switched voice lines have been declining steadily in recent years as they are replaced by Voice over
Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) lines. More generally, fixed-line telephony has become a commodity product that is
now bundled into multiple play packages. Accordingly, fixed-line services have become dependent on the quality
of the broadband internet offering and rate pricing for fixed-line telephony is now the market standard. Despite
these changes, the decline in use of fixed-line telephony has been slow as most households still maintain a fixedline at home.

_Mobile Telephony and Mobile Broadband Internet_

Consumption of mobile telephony and data services has continued to rise globally, driven by a growing penetration
and a wider availability of smart phones. Mobile data traffic is forecasted to grow at an average rate of 46%
between 2017 and 2022 according to third party sources, mainly driven by the development of smartphone devices
supporting multiple wireless technologies. As mobile internet usage is mainly in the vicinity of home or office,
we believe that operators’ success in the mobile telephony services business will largely rely on their ability to
access a high capacity backbone with compelling mobile tower backhaul offload solutions and a strong integration
of their mobile telephony offers with residential broadband based offload capabilities to cope with increasing data
consumption.

Despite this general trend, each mobile telephony market has a different structure and dynamic, depending on a
variety of factors including, among other factors, the number of mobile network operators versus mobile virtual
network operators, penetration of post-paid versus pre-paid subscription, regulation, available spectrum, and
commercial strategies of operators such as handset subsidies. The success of mobile operators in the various
markets is largely dependent on the overall environment and its competitive advantage. As such, we have decided
to implement a versatile mobile strategy that takes advantage of the fixed mobile convergence. As part of this
strategy, we operate a mobile network in Israel and we expect to benefit from synergies with our scalable cable
networks in Israel.

_Fixed-line Enterprise Telecom Services_

We provide business-to-business (“B2B”) telecom services, including voice and data to Enterprise customers, in
a number of our geographies. We are increasingly migrating our Enterprise customers from voice-only products
to integrated systems involving data connectivity, information and communications technology (“ICT”)
applications and cloud-based solutions. We believe our network infrastructure and pooled experience across the
Group give us a competitive advantage in this segment.

_Media_

The media industry continues to shift to digital formats driven by technological advancements and changes in
consumer behavior. Per International Data Corporation (“IDC”), the global advertising market was estimated to
be $682 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3.3% from
2020 through 2024. As consumers have spent increasingly more time online with the rise of mobile devices, social
media platforms and the proliferation of online content, the global digital advertising market has experienced rapid
growth. Digital advertising growth is expected to outpace the overall advertising market as digital continues to
take market share from traditional media like print and radio. Of the global advertising market, $319 billion, or
47% was attributed to global digital advertising spend. Digital advertising has increased from 36% of total
advertising in 2017 and is expected to grow to 55% of total advertising by 2024. Per IDC, in the U.S., digital
advertising was estimated to be $128 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 7.4% CAGR from 2020 through
2024.


-----

Within the global digital advertising market, there are several segments that drive growth:

        - _Programmatic advertising. Programmatic advertising is the automated buying and selling of_
digital ads, optimizing performance and pricing through real-time signals. According to IDC,
global programmatic digital ad spending was $142 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a
10% CAGR from 2020 through 2024. This does not include search advertising. Within
programmatic advertising, programmatic digital video advertising spending was estimated at
$53 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 12.6% CAGR from 2020 through 2024.

        - _Mobile Advertising. For consumers, mobile is now the primary and preferred device format for_
consuming digital content and making purchases. According to third party sources, there are
currently 14 billion mobile devices in use globally, and this is expected to expand at a 6.0%
CAGR from 2020 through 2024 to an estimated 17.7 billion devices. As global mobile device
growth explodes, facilitated by improved devices and connectivity, growth in mobile
advertising is expected to continue. The digital mobile advertising market has grown at a 26%
CAGR since 2017 to $197 billion in 2020 according to IDC and is expected to grow at a 12.7%
CAGR going forward from 2020 through 2024.

        - _Video Ad Formats. According to IDC, in 2020 video advertising was $57 billion of the overall_
digital advertising market, or 18%. This is expected to increase to 20% of the total digital market
by 2024 and grow at an 11% CAGR, which outpaces the market.

        - _Performance Advertising Growth. Performance advertising, as opposed to brand advertising, is_
used to achieve measurable results, including retaining an audience, generating leads, boosting
sales or increasing loyalty, as a direct and immediate result of users seeing and interacting with
an ad. According to IDC, the global performance advertising market was estimated to be $176
billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.1% CAGR from 2020 through 2024.

**1.** **Portugal**

_Macroeconomic Overview_

Portugal is our largest operating market after France. According to the IMF, Portugal has a population of
approximately 10.3 million as of December 2020. It is a developed market economy with a GDP per capita in
2020 of $22.5 thousand, as compared to $45.7 thousand for Germany, $40.4 thousand for the UK and $39.9
thousand for France. According to the IMF, Portugal’s GDP is expected to grow at 3.9% in 2021. This is in line
with other developed European economies such as Germany, which is forecast to grow 3.6%, the U.K., which is
expected to grow 7.0% and France, which is expected to grow 5.8%, respectively over the same period, according
to IMF.

Similarly, Portuguese unemployment has significantly improved over the last decade, having declined from 17.5%
in March 2013 to 6.5% as of December 2019 (pre COVID-19 outbreak) (Source: IMF). This compares with
unemployment rates as of December 2019 of 3.2% in Germany (Source: IMF), 8.5% in France (Source: IMF),
and 3.8% in the UK (Source: IMF).

_Competitive Overview_

**1.1.** **Pay Television**

According to third party sources, as of March 31, 2021 there were approximately 4.2 million pay television
subscribers in Portugal. Pay television penetration has been rising over the past years driven by the high demand
for a broad range of pay television channels and the relative weakness of free terrestrial television, which only
transmits five channels. Pay television has historically been primarily provided over the cable platform, which has
a higher roll out rate than many Western European countries with DTH a complementary platform in rural areas,
and more recently, IPTV in areas where fiber is present. Most of the pay television market is divided between two
players: Altice, the largest player by number of subscribers, and NOS. Vodafone is a third service provider, but it
has a limited coverage in rural areas. Based on third party researches, excluding other small providers, as of
March 31, 2021, Altice, NOS, and Vodafone had approximately 40%, 36% and 18% of market share nationwide,
respectively. In recent years, Altice Portugal has been maintaining market share due to the provision of local and
original content as well as innovative features (e.g. multi-screen and non-linear content). Altice Portugal has
primarily offered low-priced IPTV, predominately in fiber areas and to a lesser extent on its DSL network;
however, it also has a DTH offering for rural areas where its DSL network suffers from technological limitations.
Altice Portugal’s IPTV offering, sold primarily as part of triple-play packages, has historically not taken customers
away from cable. However, it has driven OM increase in pay television penetration.

**1.2.** **Broadband internet**

_Introduction_

According to third party sources, as of March 31, 2021, there were approximately 4.2 million broadband internet
subscribers, with an average penetration rate (as a percentage of households) of slightly above 100%. There are a
number of operators providing broadband internet services to residential customers in Portugal. Altice Portugal is
ranked as the top player in this market with a 41% market share, while NOS has a 35% market share and Vodafone
19% market share as of March 31, 2021, according to third party reports. The Portuguese broadband market has
strong growth prospects given penetration upside potential. Growth is also expected to be driven by upgrading to
higher speed offerings, based on a cable or fiber network infrastructure.

**1.3.** **Fixed-line Telephony**

According to third party sources, as of December 2020, there were approximately 5.2 million fixed-line
subscribers in Portugal, with a penetration rate (as a percentage of households) more than 125%. At the same time,


-----

PT Portugal’s number of subscribers remains stable due to an increase in multiple-play penetration. Altice and
NOS are the leading players with market shares of 46% and 35%, respectively, as of March 31, 2021, according
to third party reports.

**1.4.** **Mobile Telephony and Data**

_Introduction_

According to third party sources, the Portuguese mobile market had 15.5 million mobile subscribers, representing
a penetration level of >150% in March 2021, making it the fifth most saturated wireless market in Europe at that
date.

Altice Portugal is strongly positioned as the market leader with 39% market share, significantly ahead of Vodafone
with a market share of 29%, followed by NOS with a market share of 32%, as of 31 March, 2021. The introduction
of Altice Portugal’s quad-play offer M4O in January 2013 has helped accelerate market convergence. All three
players introduced 4G at the beginning of 2012.

**1.5.** **Bundling**

As a consequence of consumer preferences and the parallel consolidation of fixed and mobile players, Portugal’s
telecommunications market has been transitioning towards convergence relatively faster than other European
markets, with an increasing number of residential and B2B customers taking triple-play and quadruple-play
services from the same operator (such as the M4O offer of Altice). From an operator perspective, offering bundled
services from a single point of contact helps increase ARPU, improve customer loyalty and reduce churn. This
trend favors integrated players with state-of-the art network and IT platforms that are able to offer innovative
bundled offerings to customers.

**1.6.** **Enterprise**

We own the largest B2B telecom providers in Portugal. Our main competitor in these markets is NOS, a newcomer
to the B2B telecom market with an opportunistic strategy leveraging fixed and mobile networks, Vodafone, a
mobile telecommunications company, and AR Telecom.

Optimus has historically been one of the most aggressive competitors regarding pricing and through its merger
with ZON has gained access to an enhanced backbone, last mile access and an enhanced ability to address both
large and smaller companies. Vodafone and AR Telecom have adopted different strategies to realize B2B
opportunities, but have both had limited success to date due to lack of knowledge of fixed networks and lack of
credibility in the corporate market.

There is a general trend in the Enterprise segment to migrate customers away from voice services to higher margin
data services and, increasingly, integrated solutions including ICT and outsourcing. PT Portugal will capture value
from the trend to more data-intensive integrated solutions and to provide converged fixed mobile solutions
leveraging our integrated HFC, fiber and 3G and 4G mobile networks. We benefit from a large sales force with
strong distribution capabilities in the banking and public administrations sectors and broad supplier relationships,
which enrich the range of our services.

**2.** **Israel**

_Macroeconomic Overview_

We operate a significant portion of our business in Israel, which has a population of approximately 9.2 million as
of December 31, 2020, according to the IMF. According to the IMF, between 2015 and 2020, the population of
Israel grew at an average rate of 1.9% per annum and is expected to continue to grow at an average rate of 1.8%
per annum from 2020 to 2025, thus providing a natural floor to expansion in the number of inhabitants and
households, the target market for our fixed-based and mobile services.

Israel has a developed market economy. In 2010, Israel joined the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (“OECD”) and in 2020 had a GDP per capita of $43.7 thousand, compared to other European
countries such as $45.7 thousand for Germany, $40.4 thousand for the UK and $39.9 thousand for France,
according to the IMF. From 1992 to 2020, Israeli real GDP has grown at an average rate of 3.9%, according to


-----

IMF. This compares favorably as against the average real GDP growth rate in other European countries such as
1.2% for Germany, 1.3% for France and 1.7% for UK, and 2.4% for the U.S. over the same period.

During this period, Israel faced a decline in real GDP in only two years, in 2002 and 2020. Since the beginning of
the global economic slowdown in 2007 up to 2020, the Israeli economy has witnessed a high level of resilience:
Israeli real GDP has grown at an average rate of 3.2%. Israel maintains a sovereign AA-, A+ and A1 rating from
S&P, Fitch and Moody’s, respectively. Israel’s real GDP is expected to grow by 5.0% from 2020 to 2021 versus
an average of Germany, which is forecast to grow 3.6%, the U.K., which is expected to grow 7.0% and France,
which is expected to grow 5.8% according to the IMF over the same period.

Israel also enjoys high levels of literacy, life expectancy and disposable income. Israel’s economy is diversified
and competitive in an international arena with a significant level of exports focused around high technology
equipment, cut diamonds and agricultural products. Israel usually posts sizable trade deficits, as it imports crude
oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment, predominately offset by tourism and other service exports, as
well as significant foreign investment inflows, which contribute to the balance of payments, and a relatively stable
currency.

The Israeli media and telecommunications markets have, over the past several years, slowly been converging as
customers were inclined to subscribe to their media and telecommunications services from a single provider. Israel
has relatively high estimated penetration rates for pay television, broadband internet infrastructure access and
mobile telephony of 62% (2019), 88% (2019) and 385% (2019), according to third party reports. This environment
fosters a market for packaged offerings or “multiple-play”, whereby television, broadband internet infrastructure
access and fixed-line telephony services are bundled into integrated offerings referred to as “dual play” or “doubleplay” (two services provided together), or “triple-play” (three services provided together).

HOT offers triple-play packages including pay television, broadband internet infrastructure across and fixed line
telephony in Israel to its Cable/Fiber customers. We believe that offering bundled services allows media and
telecommunication service providers to meet customers’ communication and entertainment requirements
increases customer loyalty and attract new customers as the value proposition of the offering is enhanced.

_Competitive Overview_

**2.1.** **Pay Television**

_Introduction_

Israel’s primary television platforms are dominated by pay television with relatively limited penetration of free
platforms such as terrestrial television or free DTH. As a result of the free-to-air platforms being relatively
unattractive (given their access to only six channels offered by DTT) and limited local content for free DTH,
Israel’s pay television market has an estimated penetration level of approximately 62%, according to third party
reports. The Israeli pay television market has been stable by the number of subscribers since 2009 at approximately
1.6 million subscribers. Similar to Western European markets, television consumer behavior in Israel is focused
on digital, innovative, HDTV and interactive television services such as VoD and “start over”.

Most Israeli households subscribe to pay television packages via cable or satellite, mostly digital, provided by
HOT and YES, an associate of Bezeq, respectively. The established pay television operators face competition
from free television (including DTT) and alternative ways of accessing television channels (such as OTT
television). The competitive advantage of pay television via cable or DTH (reliability, image quality, diversified
international and local language content and the ability to offer advanced interactive services among others) and
the loyalty of the existing customer base lead to the pay television industry having relatively stable subscription
revenues when compared to other countries where competition from other platforms is more prevalent. As of 2019,
the Israeli pay television market had 1.6 million subscribers, 49.7% of which accessing through cable (HOT),
34.2% through satellite (Bezeq) and 16.1% through IPTV (Cellcom), according to third party sources.

_Cable_

HOT is the sole cable operator in Israel with a network covering nearly all Israeli homes (a unique situation in
OECD countries) and generates revenues principally from subscription fees paid by customers for the services
provided. HOT co-develops and co-owns a number of popular shows, movies and series. It offers a number of
proprietary channels as part of its packages giving them a competitive advantage.

_Satellite_

Satellite television is the main alternative to cable television in Israel. Television viewers can receive free to air
or paid satellite television, which is offered by YES. The ARPU generated by satellite television customers has
historically expanded at a slower pace than cable ARPU. Digitalization and the emergence of a broader offering
of channels and additional services will drive the ARPU development going forward.

_DTT_

DTT is an alternative way of receiving television services and watching certain television channels. The
penetration rates of DTT are low due to several reasons: (i) DTT offers access to fewer channels than cable
channels only; (ii) there is no access to premium or thematic content, such as sports, movies or children’s
programming; (iii) DTT has no interactive functionalities such as VoD or “start over”; (iv) DTT has limited
capacity to transfer significant number of channels simultaneously; and (v) the quality of its transmission can be
affected by weather. The expanded service will use three multiplexes up from the current one. However, we
believe that cable television will maintain its advantage over DTT as the increase in the number of channels does
not fundamentally address some of the key customer requirements such as interactivity and ability to choose
individualized content packages, and DTT channels have struggled to be successful without the revenue generated
by customer subscription charges.

_Other Emerging Technologies_

We face a growing but limited competition from other technologies in Israel when compared to the European
markets. Players, such as websites and online aggregators of content that deliver broadcasts OTT of existing
broadband internet networks may become significant competitors in the future.

The full extent to which these alternative technologies will compete effectively with our cable television system
is not yet known; however we believe that the international IPTV market will have difficulty impacting the Israeli
multichannel TV market due to various reasons, including: (i) the availability of certain local language content


-----

available through cable or satellite only; (ii) the quality of the signal on certain DSL enabled connections located
far from exchanges; (iii) the inability to access HDTV content on most DSL connections during peak times; and
(iv) the ability of cable operators to bundle pay television with other fixed-line products.

**2.2.** **Broadband internet**

_Introduction_

Israel is a mid-sized broadband internet market based on penetration compared to the large Western European or
North American peer countries, with approximately 2.0 million broadband internet subscriptions (residential and
business) as of December 31, 2013, and 2.4 million as of December 31, 2018. The broadband internet penetration
rate in Israel (being the number of broadband internet subscriptions per 100 households in Israel) is 88%,
according to third party reports, as of December 31, 2018, compared to 84% as of December 31, 2010.

Broadband internet in Israel is uniquely structured as households wishing to subscribe to broadband internet are
required to purchase an internet access service from a licensed Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) and a broadband
internet infrastructure access service from HOT or Bezeq, the only telecommunication operators which own a
nationwide physical fixed-line infrastructure.

_Broadband Internet Infrastructure Access_

HOT and Bezeq are the only fixed-infrastructure owners nationwide. HOT uses cable, while Bezeq is building
out a fiber network to replace its DSL network. Growth in the Israel broadband internet infrastructure access
market has been driven by (i) the number of subscribers to broadband internet infrastructure access and (ii) a
significant growth in broadband internet ARPUs.

Bezeq is the leading broadband internet infrastructure access provider in Israel, with 1.7 million subscriptions as
of December 31, 2018, including business and residential customers. Including business customers, Bezeq
represents approximately 70% of the total broadband internet infrastructure access market by total number of
subscribers as of December 31, 2018.

On August 29, 2012, Bezeq announced it had decided to broaden the deployment of the optical fibers so that they
will arrive as close as possible to the customers through Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) or Fiber-to-the-Building
(FTTB), to form the basis for the future supply of advanced communication services and with greater bandwidth
than was being provided.

As of December 31, 2018, we had a market share of 30% of the broadband internet infrastructure market.

What differentiates us from Bezeq is our ability to offer the highest speeds in Israel on a large scale, allowing our
customers to connect several devices (such as computers, tablets and smartphones (via WiFi connection))
simultaneously without impairing the quality of television signals or the speed and quality of the internet
connections.

The telecom market in Israel has been opened to more competition through wholesale access, offered at a regulated
price. The regulation allows internet service providers to lease infrastructure from Bezeq at a government
controlled price, and offer a complete range of services including fixed voice, broadband internet and television.

The wholesale market has gained strong traction since launch in the first quarter of 2015. As of September 30,
2019, Bezeq provided wholesale services to 601 thousand active lines.

**2.3.** **Fixed-line Telephony**

Subscribers to fixed-line telephony services include households and enterprises. The number of lines has been
declining slowly, which is in line with most Western European countries where fixed-line penetration of
households has declined on the back of an increase in number of individuals who use mobile phones only. Bezeq,
the incumbent fixed-line telephony service provider in Israel, is the largest provider of fixed-line telephony
services. In line with Western European trends, the incumbent Bezeq saw a decline in its market share over the
past years.


-----

The market for residential telephony in Israel faces pressure from alternative carriers, declining mobile termination
and interconnection rates, as well as alternative access technologies such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
(e.g. Skype). The fixed-line telephony services have been largely a commodity and uptake has become
increasingly dependent on a quality broadband internet offering by the same provider. Fixed-line telephony is
increasingly included in bundles, which benefit HOT because of its ability to provide attractive bundles offerings.
Fixed-line telephony has experienced some price erosion over the past few years, partly driven by a reduction in
termination fees and pressure from to bundle discount, and resulted in the decline in ARPUs.

**2.4.** **Mobile Telephony**

There were approximately 9.8 million mobile telephony customers in Israel as of March 31, 2021. Penetration
was estimated to be 111% as of December 31, 2020, according to third party reports.

There are five licensed Mobile Network Operators (“MNOs”) which offer mobile telephony services to the public
and several players who operate MVNOs, although MVNOs currently have insignificant market share of the
mobile telephony market. Market shares of the top three mobile operators, Cellcom, Partner Communications and
Pelephone (Bezeq), have been relatively stable over the past years at approximately 25% each. New entrants like
HOT Mobile (previously MIRS) were granted UMTS licenses in 2011 with services launched in the second
quarter of 2012 through a combination of proprietary networks and national roaming agreements with existing
operators. According to third party sources, as of March 31, 2021, HOT Mobile had approximately 1.3 million
mobile subscribers, corresponding to a market share of approximately 14% compared to 4% as of December 31,
2011. The ARPU for mobile telephony subscribers of all mobile operators in Israel has declined substantially over
the last decade, partly driven by a new mobile termination fee regulation in September 2010 which reduced mobile
termination rates.

The Israeli mobile communications market is more competitive than some of the markets in Western Europe,
notably given the recent legislation, enacted in April 2012, preventing operators from charging exit fees, except
in limited circumstances. As a result, the Israeli mobile market now offers fewer barriers to entry for the new
mobile license owners HOT Mobile and Golan Telecom.

The Israeli market features lower ARPUs than in most of the other developed markets, which makes mobile
telecom services more attractive to consumers.

_Mobile Broadband Internet_

Most mobile subscribers today are active 3G and 4G subscribers. Mobile operators’ network capability can be
further enhanced by Long Term Evolution (“LTE”) network roll out, which enable higher speeds for mobile
broadband internet. Mobile broadband internet operators, however currently only offer speeds and capacities that
are significantly lower than those offered by cable and DSL operators. As a result, we believe that, in the medium
term, HFC cable will be the only broadband internet infrastructure access alternative to DSL with an extensive
coverage and high bandwidth for the foreseeable future.

**3.** **Dominican Republic**

_Industry Overview_

The Dominican Republic is the third largest economy in the Caribbean and Central America after Cuba and Puerto
Rico, with a GDP of $78.7 billion according to the IMF in 2020, and the third largest country in terms of
population after Haiti and Cuba, with a population of 10.5 million according to the IMF. According to the IMF,
32% of the population was living in the Dominican Republic’s two main cities, Santo Domingo and Santiago, in
2010. According to the IMF, between 2015 and 2019, the real GDP of the Dominican Republic grew at an average
rate of 6.1%. The economy is predominantly based on services, in particular tourism. Its GDP per capita, however,
is lower than other countries in the region, including Trinidad & Tobago, Panama and Costa Rica, and real GDP
is expected to grow at 5.2% per annum in average between 2021 and 2025 according to the IMF. In addition, the
Dominican Republic enjoys a strong commercial relationship with the United States, its largest export and import
partner. These factors are expected to continue help drive personal consumption and usage of telecommunications
products and services.

The Dominican Republic telecommunications markets is dominated by Claro, the incumbent owned by the
Mexican telecom operator America Movil, and its main challenger, Altice, in both the fixed and mobile markets.


-----

Both operators own and operate multiple fixed and mobile technologies running in parallel to ensure maximum
coverage and reliability to their customers. Other players in the Dominican Republic telecommunications market
are relatively small, with less advanced networks and more limited coverage. These include Wind Telecom, a
wireless operator, Viva, a mobile operator and Aster, a cable operator.

In the broadband internet market, Altice is the second largest provider next to the incumbent Claro, our main
competitor, with national market shares of approximately 62% (Claro) and 26% (Altice) as of December 2020,
according to third party reports. In the mobile market, Altice Dominicana’s key competitor is Claro.

_Mobile Telephony_

The mobile market is the largest telecom market in the Dominican Republic. Compared to other Western European
markets, the Dominican Republic is characterized by a young population with lower purchasing power. According
to third party sources, the mobile penetration rate in the Dominican Republic is approximately 83% as of March
31, 2021, lower than mobile penetration rates in Brazil, Argentina or Chile. Claro enjoys a 61% market share as
of March, 2021, followed by Altice (34%).

Telecom concession attributions are decided by the regulator based on certain administrative criteria and the
renewal of these concessions generate no meaningful incremental fees. Frequency licenses attribution and renewal
processes typically occur concomitantly with the telecom concession processes. New frequencies are tendered
with several parties typically bidding and the new license attributed to the highest bidder while renewal of
frequency licenses gives rise to no incremental fees for telecom operators. The regulator does not typically impose
MTR reductions and favors such bilateral agreements between operators. The law provides for the possibility of
MVNOs. From a telecom infrastructure standpoint, the regulator favors passive and active sharing with bilateral
negotiation being the preferred route.

_Pay Television, Broadband and Fixed-Line Telephony_

According to third party reports, the Dominican Republic has an estimated 33% broadband penetration rate as of
March 2021 and 35% fixed voice line penetration rate as of March 2021. These penetration rates are typically
lower than those measured in a number of Latin American countries and evidence significant potential for growth
in the Dominican Republic according to third party reports. Mobile will play an increasingly important role, with
only a limited part of broadband uptake expected to be attributable to fixed broadband. In addition, fixed-line
telephony is expected to continue to decline going forward, in particular due to ongoing substitution of fixed-line
by mobile services, in line with trends seen in other developed economies.

The pay television market in the Dominican Republic is highly fragmented with over 6 pay television operators,
although only a limited number operate a two-way network, and a handful of other players have a subscriber base
exceeding 10,000. Claro and Altice together represent approximately 97% market share (59% and 38% market
share respectively, according to third party sources), as of December 2018, delivering services over IPTV and
DTH and cable respectively. Other smaller players include Wind through its MMDS technology.

Broadband internet access is typically delivered by a mix of fixed-line infrastructure and mobile access, with the
use of mobile broadband being primarily driven by the availability of fixed-line infrastructure in a given location.

The broadband and fixed telephony markets are relatively concentrated, with Claro and Altice together accounting
for the large majority of the broadband market and of the fixed telephony market). Claro delivers broadband
services through its xDSL and FTTx networks, while Altice uses its xDSL and cable infrastructure. Both Claro
and Altice offer fixed-line telephony services using VoiP and Public Switched Telephone Network (“PSTN”).
Other smaller players have a limited presence, with e.g., Wind Telecom’s wireless technology.

**DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are a multinational broadband and mobile communications, content and media group operating in Portugal,
Israel and the Dominican Republic. We have major positions in a number of segments of the telecommunications
markets in which we operate, including residential fixed, residential mobile and business services, which includes
B2B services and wholesale, and also offer other services, which includes media, content and advertisement
services. In the geographies in which we operate, we are either the largest or the second largest fixed services
provider, and a leading provider of multi-play services offering bundled triple-play (“3P”) services and, where
possible, quad-play (“4P”) services and focus our marketing on our multi-play offerings. We are also the largest
mobile operator in Portugal, the second largest mobile operator in the Dominican Republic, and a significant
competitor to the three largest mobile operators in Israel. As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately 10,159,000
total mobile B2C subscribers and approximately 3,011,000 total fixed B2C unique customers as well as a fiber
network passing approximately 8,707,000 homes in our footprint (including homes accessed through wholesale
fiber operators). Our service portfolio in each of the regions in which we operate is set forth below under “—
_Overview of Service Portfolio”._

The Group was created through a number of price-disciplined acquisitions of telecommunications businesses,
including: PT Portugal in Portugal, HOT in Israel, and Altice Dominicana in the Dominican Republic. Our
acquisition strategy has allowed us to target fiber/cable and mobile operators with what we believe to be highquality networks in markets we find attractive from an economic, competitive and regulatory standpoint and create
value at the acquired businesses by implementing operational improvements and leveraging economies of scale,
as well as pursuing in-market consolidation and attractive diversification with B2B, DSL and mobile add-on
opportunities. Furthermore, this has enabled us to grow the acquired businesses organically while we continue to
focus on cost optimization and increasing economies of scale and operational synergies as our Group develops.
Moreover, as part of our strategy, we also focus on the convergence of telecommunications, media, content and
advertising to offer more value to our customers. For example, since June 2017 we have owned Teads, which is a
leading video advertising marketplace with, as of April 2021, 1.9 billion unique monthly users worldwide. In
Portugal, in February 2017, we acquired a 25% stake in the capital of sports broadcaster SPORT TV.

We have invested in high quality cable and fiber-based network infrastructure which allows us to offer advanced
multi-play and high bandwidth services in a vast majority of our service areas. Our fixed-line services in Portugal
are primarily delivered over FTTH, DSL and DTH, in Israel are primarily delivered over HFC cables (and since
April 2021, fiber-based internet services are also delivered over IBC Israel’s fiber optic network in certain areas
where the network had already been deployed) and in the Dominican Republic are delivered over both HFC cable
and FTTH, in each case that are among the most technically advanced in the markets in which we operate. Our
cable networks enable us to offer download speeds of at least 200 Mbps to a majority of homes passed in our
footprint in Israel and the Dominican Republic. We believe that our cable networks are well positioned for future
technological developments, while the fiber networks in Portugal are already set up to provide download speeds
of up to 1 Gbps. We are focused on increasing our investment in fiber in Portugal. We own 50.01% of FastFiber,
comprising all of our fiber assets in Portugal, including FTTH and dark fiber, which was created in April 2020 in
partnership with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners. Through FastFiber, we rolled out over 388,000 new fiber
homes passed in 2018, 356,000 new fiber homes passed in 2019, 603,000 new fiber homes passed in 2020 and a
further 73,000 new fiber homes passed in the three months ended March 31, 2021. Throughout our geographies,
we are working to expand our fiber network. In Israel, in February 2021, we acquired a 23.3% stake in IBC Israel.
In Portugal and the Dominican Republic, we continue to upsell our fiber/cable based services to our existing DSL
subscriber base. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, without giving effect to intersegment eliminations,
we generated residential fixed revenues of €631 million in Portugal, €563 million in Israel and €91 million in the
Dominican Republic.

We operate an extensive mobile network, which provides 4G coverage for 99.6% of the population of Portugal,
99.9% of the population of Israel and 97.5% of the population of the Dominican Republic, in each case, as of
March 31, 2021. In addition, we have relationships with the industry’s significant mobile equipment providers
and are able to offer customers top-of-the-market mobile equipment. In 2018, we completed the Towers
Transactions, through which we monetized the value of our passive mobile infrastructure assets in Portugal and
the Dominican Republic. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, without giving effect to intersegment
eliminations, we generated residential mobile revenues of €463 million in Portugal, €210 million in Israel and
€263 million in the Dominican Republic.


-----

Further, we are in various stages of bidding for and investing in 5G spectrum in all jurisdictions in which we
operate our mobile services. Following the completion of the 5G spectrum auction in Israel in August 2020, HOT
along with Partner was awarded two bands of 700 MHz (10 MHz each band), two bands of 2,600 MHz (20 MHz
each band) and 10 bands of 3,500 MHz (10 MHz each band). After completion of the required preconditions, on
September 29, 2020 the spectrums were allocated to HOT and HOT’s license was amended to allow the operation
of 5G network. We launched 5G services in the first quarter of 2021 in certain areas in Israel. In Portugal, the 5G
spectrum auction started on December 22, 2020 and the main auction is ongoing. The expected allocation of rights
of use for frequencies is scheduled for the third quarter of 2021. In the Dominican Republic, the 5G spectrum
auction started on February 9, 2021 and the auction is ongoing. The expected allocation of rights of use for
frequencies is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect to participate in both of these auctions.

In furtherance of our convergence strategy, we are focused on delivering high quality content offerings to
complement our fixed and mobile services, including producing proprietary content, including live broadcasts of
sports events and other sports- and lifestyle-related programs as well as the sports programming for which the
Group has acquired broadcasting rights. For instance, this strategy is evidenced by our investment in SPORT TV
for broadcasting premium sports content in Portugal. In July 2020, PT OpCo entered into a new distribution
agreement with SPORT TV for a four-season period, pursuant to which PT Portugal committed to pay a noncontingent fixed price plus an additional variable fee component based on the number of subscribers and
penetration rate. Between the end of 2015 and early 2016, we had entered into various agreements with other
telecom operators and football clubs in Portugal to acquire reciprocal or exclusive broadcasting rights, including
a sponsorship agreement with F.C. Porto. In Israel, we have entered into commitments to purchase content, mainly
channels. We have also entered into various arrangements with Altice France Group’s Altice TV division,
including non-exclusive distribution rights in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic of Netflix and
Discovery channels. We intend to continue to selectively invest in local and value-added premium content as well
as sports broadcasting and distribution rights in the future to differentiate our convergent communication services
from those of our competitors.

Through Teads, the digital advertising business acquired in 2017, we operate a leading, cloud-based, end-to-end
technology platform that enables programmatic digital advertising for a global, curated ecosystem of quality
advertisers and their agencies and quality publishers. Teads operates in the Open Web outside of the Walled
Gardens. As an end-to-end solution, Teads’ platform consists of buy-side, sell-side, creative, data and artificial
intelligence optimization modules. As a result, Teads has built deep partnerships with both the demand and supply
sides of digital advertising. For advertisers and their agencies, Teads’ platform offers a single access point to buy
the inventory of many of the world’s best publishers. Through exclusive partnerships with these premium
publishers, Teads enables customers to reach 1.9 billion unique monthly users (as of April 2021), while improving
the efficiency, quality and cost of digital ad transactions. For approximately 3,100 publishers, Teads is a trusted
monetization partner, providing the technology required to monetize their most valuable ad inventory
programmatically. By connecting both sides through Teads’ integrated platform, known as the _Teads Global_
_Media Platform, Teads solves the digital programmatic advertising industry’s most significant problems related_
to value chain fragmentation, inefficient digital advertising pricing and quality and scale of inventory. Teads refers
to the ecosystem enabled by Teads Global Media Platform as the Curated Internet.

As of March 31, 2021, Teads had approximately 3,100 editorial publishers on its platform, representing more than
15,000 web and app properties that provide access to more than one trillion ad opportunities every year. Teads’
number of customers, defined as customers who spent at least $1,000 in the trailing 12-month period, grew to
approximately 2,000 as of December 31, 2020. Teads’ retention rate of customers who spent above $150,000 with
Teads in the prior period compared to those same customers in the current period irrespective of their spending
(the “Gross Customer Retention Rate”) was 94% for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and December
31, 2020. For more information, see “—Other Services—Media”. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021,
without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, we generated revenues from Teads of €488 million.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, the Group generated total consolidated revenues of €4,088 million,
of which, without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, €2,148 million, €981 million, €475 million and €488
million was contributed by our Portugal, Israel, Dominican Republic and Teads segments, respectively, and
Adjusted EBITDA of €1,575 million, of which, without giving effect to intersegment eliminations, €828 million,
€343 million, €233 million and €177 million was contributed by our Portugal, Israel, Dominican Republic and
Teads segments, respectively.

**_Significant Investments and Dispositions_**

We have expanded internationally through a number of price-disciplined acquisitions of telecommunications
businesses. Set forth below is a list of the significant investments we have made in the businesses that currently
constitute the Group:

        - In May 2010, we acquired MIRS Communications Ltd. (“MIRS”), an Israeli company
providing iDEN-based mobile services. In March 2011, we acquired a controlling interest in
HOT. In November 2011, HOT acquired MIRS from us and renamed the company HOT Mobile
Ltd. In December 2012, we completed the take-private transaction of HOT whereby we acquired
substantially all of the equity interests in HOT that we did not previously own.

        - On March 12, 2014 and April 9, 2014, we completed, through our subsidiary Altice Caribbean,
the acquisition of Dominican telecommunications providers Tricom S.A. (“Tricom”) and Altice
Hispaniola. Altice Hispaniola was renamed Altice Dominicana S.A. in November 2017. Altice
Dominicana and Tricom merged with effect from January 1, 2018 to form the combined Altice
Dominicana business.

        - On June 2, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in PT Portugal, Portugal’s
incumbent telecom provider, through which we currently offer telecom services in Portugal.

        - On February 24, 2017, PT Portugal acquired a 25% stake in the capital of SPORT TV. SPORT
TV is a premium sports broadcaster based in Portugal. Following this investment, SPORT TV’s
shareholders are PT Portugal, its main competitors NOS and Vodafone, and Olivedesportos,
each of which holds a 25% interest.

        - On June 22, 2017, we completed the Teads Acquisition through Altice Teads S.A. Altice
International directly and indirectly owns 96.8% of the share capital and voting rights of Teads.
Altice International has entered into certain arrangements pursuant to which it has the option to
purchase, and the managers of Teads have the option to sell to Altice International, certain
minority interest in Teads (via an indirect holding company) with an exercise price based on a
pre-determined formula. As of March 31, 2021, the financial liability relating to the put options
based on the discounted cash flows valuation recognized in the consolidated financial
statements is €205.9 million and the financial asset relating to the call option based on the Black
and Scholes model recognized in the consolidated financial statements is €158.0 million. Teads
operates a leading, cloud-based, end-to-end technology platform that enables programmatic
digital advertising for the programmatic ecosystem operating outside of the large advertising
platforms. Through exclusive partnerships with premium publishers, as of April 2021, we
enable customers to reach 1.9 billion unique monthly users.

        - On September 15, 2020, HOT announced the acquisition of a minority stake in IBC Israel. The
transaction was closed on February 11, 2021 following regulatory and third-party approvals.
Post the closing of the acquisition, HOT became an equal partner in the IBC Partnership, an
entity that holds 70% of IBC Israel’s share capital, together with Cellcom and Israel
Infrastructure Fund. HOT indirectly holds 23.3% of IBC Israel’s share capital, through an
investment of €45 million, substantially equal to the investment made by each of Cellcom and
Israel Infrastructure Fund.

From time to time we may dispose of our interests in certain businesses within the Group. Set forth below is a list
of the significant dispositions we have made since January 1, 2018:

        - On January 31, 2018, we completed the sale of 100% of the share capital of Altice Management
International S.A. (“AMI”) to Altice Group Lux. AMI is a company based in Switzerland,
which provides management services to group entities.

        - On February 12, 2018, we completed the sale of our telecommunications solutions business and
data center operations in Switzerland, green.ch AG and Green Datacenter AG, to InfraVia
Capital Partners.


-----

        - On May 15, 2018, we completed the sale of 100% of the share capital of Altice TV, then a
subsidiary of Altice International which, together with its subsidiaries, encompassed Altice
Europe’s content distribution division, to Altice Group Lux.

        - On May 16, 2018, we completed the sale of 100% of the share capital of Altice Technical
Service France, an all-around technical services company offering, among other things, network
deployment, upgrade and maintenance services, to the Altice France Group.

        - On May 16, 2018, we also completed the sale of 65% of the share capital of ACS, a Frenchlanguage-focused operator in the customer relationship management outsourcing sector, to the
Altice France Group. In addition, we transferred the ACS Put and Call Options (as defined
below) to the Altice France Group. The “ACS Put and Call Options” is the option to purchase,
and the managers’ option to sell, the remaining 35% interest in the event of termination of
managers’ offices or as of the sixth anniversary of the closing date of the acquisition, provided
that such options be exercised partly before that date (50% of their interest on the fourth
anniversary of the closing date and the remaining 50% on the fifth anniversary of the closing
date).

        - On September 4, 2018, we completed the sale of a 75% stake in the newly incorporated
company OMTEL, Estruturas de Comunicações, S.A. (“OMTEL”), comprising the mobile
telecommunications passive infrastructure, corresponding to 2,961 mobile sites previously
operated and demerged from PT OpCo. The above-mentioned stake in this tower business was
sold to a consortium that included Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and Horizon Equity
Partners. On January 2, 2020, we announced the sale of a 25% equity interest held by PT
Portugal in Belmont, that owns 100% of shares of OMTEL, to Cellnex. The total cash proceeds
were received in the first quarter of 2020 and amounted to €201 million, as part of a larger
transaction pursuant to which Cellnex acquired 100% of the share capital of OMTEL (the above
mentioned transactions collectively, the “Portuguese Towers Transaction”).

        - On September 12, 2018, we completed the sale of the Group’s international wholesale voice
carrier business in Portugal and the Dominican Republic to Tofane Global, a Paris-based
telecommunications and digital player specializing in international carrier services.

        - On October 3, 2018, we completed the sale of 100% of the share capital in the tower company
Teletorres del Caribe, which comprises 1,039 sites operated by Altice Dominicana, to Phoenix
Tower International, a portfolio company of Blackstone (the “Dominican Towers
**Transaction”).**

        - On October 31, 2018, we disposed of, and the Altice France Group acquired, Altice Blue Two,
the holding company for our FOT Business.

        - In April 2020, we carved-out all of our fiber assets in Portugal, including FTTH and dark fiber,
into a dedicated wholesale vehicle FastFiber. On April 17, 2020, we disposed of a 49.99%
interest in FastFiber to Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners for a cash consideration of
€1,576 million received at closing, with €375 million to be received in December 2021 and,
subject to certain performance ratchets, a further €375 million to be received in December 2026.

**_Products and Services_**

Through our various operating companies, we provide cable and fiber-based fixed services and mobile telephony
services in all of the geographies in which we operate. In addition, we offer a variety of B2B, wholesale and other
services. We also invest in specific content to complement and enrich the services we provide. Separately, through
Teads we offer a platform that powers a global, curated ecosystem connecting quality advertisers and their
agencies with quality publishers. As an end-to-end solution, the Teads platform consists of buy-side, sell-side,
creative, data and artificial intelligence optimization modules.

We offer a variety of services over our fixed-line and mobile infrastructure, including, but not limited to, pay TV,
broadband internet access, fixed-line telephony and mobile telephony to our residential customers, and, to a lesser
extent and depending on the geography, telecom services to our business services customers. We also provide
wholesale services across all our geographies (except international wholesale voice carrier business in Portugal


-----

and the Dominican Republic, which was sold to Tofane Global in 2018). We track the performance of our business
by geography and further analyze our revenues by operational activity. From January 1, 2020, we present revenue
by activity under “Residential-Fixed”, “Residential-Mobile”, “Residential Equipment”, “Business Services” and
“Media”. Prior to January 1, 2020, we presented revenue by activity under “Residential-Fixed”, “ResidentialMobile”, “Business Services” and “Media” (with revenue from equipment sales included under “ResidentialFixed” and “Residential-Mobile”, as applicable). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations of the Group—Basis of Presentation—Operational Activities” for a_
discussion of our revised presentation of our operational activities.

Our fixed-based services (high-quality pay TV, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony) are provided over
our cable- and fiber-based network infrastructure which are either DOCSIS 3.0, DOCSIS 2.0 or DSL FTTH
enabled, offering download speeds of between 30 Mbps and 1 Gbps depending on geography. As of March 31,
2021, our fiber network passed 8,707,000 homes (including homes accessed through wholesale fiber operators),
with 3,011,000 total fixed B2C unique customers. We also offer mobile-based services in the geographies in which
we operate, through 2G, 3G and 4G Long-Term-Evolution (“4G-LTE”) technology, and we had 10,159,000 total
mobile B2C subscribers (of which 5,008,000 were post-paid customers) as of March 31, 2021.

We are also focused on delivering high quality content offerings to complement our fixed and mobile services,
including proprietary content and exclusive content. For more information regarding our content offerings, see
“—Other Services—Content” below.

In all geographies in which we operate, we are focused on the convergence of fixed and mobile services by crossselling and up-selling our offerings to further increase our multi-play penetration. Our cable, fiber and mobile
technologies enable us to offer premium digital services, attractive interactive features (such as our “Meo Go!”
offering in Portugal) and high-quality content. We have leveraged our network advantage to drive our multi-play
strategy and offer an attractive combination of content, speed and functionality. We offer our residential customers
bundled double- and triple-play services, and also quad-play services in Portugal, comprising of a combination of
TV, broadband internet access and fixed-line telephony services at what we believe are attractive prices. We
believe the demand for our multi-play packages is primarily driven by the inherent quality of the various products
included in them, which we believe are among the best available in the markets in which we operate. Although
we believe our products offer the best value for money and cost-savings for customers when purchased as part of
multi-play packages, we typically also offer most of these services on a stand-alone basis in most of our
geographies.

We use a variety of brands, trade names and trademarks to market our services, and, in each case, several
associated trademarks. For more information regarding our branding strategy, see “—Marketing and Sales” and
“—Intellectual Property” below.

(1) Primarily includes Teads.

We have implemented the Altice Labs initiative which aims to leverage our engineering talents and centralize and
streamline innovative technological solutions development for the entire Group. Under the initiative, our
development team across all of the jurisdictions in which we operate (i) creates products and technology to
facilitate the build-out of our fixed and mobile network, (ii) develops systems to improve customer experience
and handle disturbances and outages with speed and precision allowing for a near uninterrupted usage of our
services and (iii) create user friendly and high quality customer interfaces and products, including new generation
set-top boxes, portals and IoT. Altice Labs was first based in Portugal and now has a presence in Israel. In the
Dominican Republic, some services are already running on the Altice Labs systems and we expect to continue
collaborating on several projects for our customers. The Altice Labs teams work closely across geographies under
the roadmap and leadership provided by the Group and share technologies and products to enhance the services
we provide in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. To promote further innovation, we also take part in
various forums and groups throughout Europe and have a strong relationship with other service providers in order
to enhance the infrastructure products and services we offer.

**Fixed Services**

**_Residential_**

We offer a variety of fixed residential services, primarily as part of multi-play packages.

**_Pay TV_**

Across our geographies, we offer digital television services which include basic and premium programming, and,
in most markets, incremental product and service offerings such as enhanced pay-per-view programming,
spanning from VoD to near-VoD (“NVoD”), digital video recorders (“DVR”), HDTV services and, in some cases,
exclusive content. Our cable networks enable us to offer interactive digital services to most of our customers. Our
pay TV offerings include content and channels purchased from a variety of local and foreign producers and we
continue to focus on broadcasting high-quality content over all of our cable networks. To ensure we cater to local
demand for content, we tailor both our basic and additional channel offerings to each country of operation
according to culture, demographics, programming preferences and local regulation. See “—Other Services—
_Content”._

_Portugal_

In Portugal, our television strategy is based on a multi-platform concept that aims to provide consistent content
and user experiences across television, personal computers (“PCs”) and mobile phones. “MEO” is our TV brand
across the various platforms, primarily at home (through IPTV and satellite), mobile telephones (through Meo Go!
_Mobile) or PCs (through Meo Go!) and Apple TV and Android TV. MEO_ provides access to a comprehensive
content offering, with more than 200 TV and radio channels and thousands of VoD titles, most of which are
offered in full HD 1080p resolution. We offer tiered packages of channels, as well as on-demand availability that
can be subscribed for, in real time, directly through the TV set. MEO also provides access to advanced features,
such as network digital recording pause live-TV and seven day restart and catchup TV for most of the channel
grid. The set-top boxes in the MEO service are all HD-compliant, using MPEG4. We were the first operator in
Portugal to introduce HDTV and a 4K experience in pay TV. In March 2018, we launched (i) a 4K WiFi portable
set top box more easily adjusted to the customer’s needs in each home division, (ii) a new TV interface, which is
based on content discovery, personalization and speed, including, among others, features that allow customers to
access more easily their most viewed channels and recently viewed programs and to select programs based on
theme and type of content and (iii) a new customer digital experience, including a new Video Chat. In 2020, MEO
was one of the few operators to have launched TV services in Apple TV and Android TV OTT SetTop boxes,
providing a unique user interface, while maintaining appreciated features like Fast Zapping and personalized
services like Continue Watching.


-----

Our quad-play offer of converged fixed-mobile services by MEO includes TV, broadband, fixed telephone and
mobile telephone services under the brand “M4O”. MEO designed this product after studying trends in the
Portuguese market which revealed increasing consumer preference for quad-play services all reflected on the same
invoice, a desire to include the entire family in a single plan and the importance of high-quality connectivity to
the internet. The entry-level M4O currently offers approximately 150 TV channels, 100 Mbps broadband speed,
unlimited national calls and 1,000 minutes to 50 international destinations, as well as one to four mobile SIM
cards, including free of charge calls (500 minutes), text messages to all wireline and wireless networks and 500
MB of mobile data, using our 3G and 4G networks. There are three additional M4O offers, with higher fixed
internet speeds and mobile internet allowances. The high end offer is the recently launched “M4O Giga”, with 1
Gbps broadband speed and 10 GB of mobile data. There is also the “M5O Giga” plan, a multi-play offering which,
in addition to increased mobile data allowances, also includes up to 30 GB of mobile broadband. MEO was the
first operator to launch Giga offers, supported on the most advanced router on the Portuguese market, providing
10x faster WiFi. MEO was the first player in Portugal to launch convergence offers, in 2013 through a quad-play
offer, and according to ANACOM currently leads the market of bundle offers, both for quad play and triple-play
offers.

In May 2018, we launched MEO BY, an innovative and entirely digital offer that allows customers to customize
their MEO package based on their preferences and needs, with no mandatory loyalty period, representing an
extremely flexible offer with more than 16,000 possible combinations between fixed and mobile communications,
fixed and mobile internet and television services.

MEO’s content offering includes thousands of VoD titles and a variety of interactive offerings based on anchor
programs. For example, we offer more than 70 interactive applications which focus on news, sports and music,
other interactive portals such as our children’s portal which provides access to combined VoD, music, games and
educational content tailored to children audiences, as well as “red button” interactive applications (whereby
viewers press a button on their remote controls to receive additional interactive services) often linked to popular
TV programs. Between the end of 2015 and early 2016, we acquired broadcasting rights for new sports
programming in Portugal, including exclusive broadcasting rights to the F.C. Porto matches in the Portuguese
Premier League, and in July 2016, we reached an agreement with certain other Portuguese telecom operators, such
as NOS Comunicações, NOS Audiovisuais, Vodafone Portugal and Cabovisão (currently Nowo), for the
reciprocal sharing of broadcasting rights of football-related content for a period of eight years. See “—Significant
_Contracts—Portugal—Contracts with football clubs” for more information. Additionally, we have entered into_
various arrangements with Altice France Group’s Altice TV division, including non-exclusive distribution rights
in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic of Netflix and Discovery channels. In November 2018, we
launched a new SVOD MEO Films & Series service aimed at broadcasting exclusive and other important series.
Throughout the years 2017 and 2018, we added new channels to our portfolio, some of which are provided
exclusively by us.

_Israel_

We are the largest provider of pay TV services in Israel based on number of subscribers. We offer primarily digital
television services in Israel under the “HOT” brand. Our standard digital television package consists of 95 base
television channels and certain radio channels and gives customers the option to purchase extra content packages
which give access to additional channels. We believe our standard offering includes more channels than that
offered by our competitors and we offer a range of Israeli and international sports, current affairs, entertainment,
music, film, documentaries, children, and adult channels, as well as channels in Arabic and Russian to address
demand from the culturally diverse population of Israel. Our standard package includes the HOT suite of channels
and others such as Eurosport, Fox News, MTV HITS and Zee TV as well as all the “must carry” channels that we
are required to carry on our network under existing regulation. We regularly update our standard digital television
package to reflect changes in viewer interest. Our higher-end packages include all six of our extra content packages
as standard and exclude premium channels such as premium sport channels and other channels which are marketed
à la carte, depending on the subscription. We also offer up to 57 television channels in HD.

In addition to a high-quality and diversified linear television offering, we offer our customers a variety of advanced
services featuring interactivity. These are available to customers whether or not they also purchase our broadband
internet services. In all of our digital television packages we provide customers with a replay service for certain
television channels, enabling a viewer who misses the start of a program to replay it while the broadcast is in
progress (“start over”), as well as “start next” service, enabling the viewer to start watching the next show prior
to its scheduled broadcast. Our digital television offering also includes an extensive VoD library containing


-----

approximately 50,000 titles as of March 31, 2021. In addition, we offer access to additional content libraries not
included in our standard VoD service on either a pay-per-view or monthly subscription basis.

In the pay-TV market, the Group’s main competitor is D.B.S. Satellite Services (1998) Ltd, a subsidiary of Bezeq,
which provides satellite technology-based television services under the brand “YES”. According to an order issued
by the Israeli Ministry of Communications, from February 23, 2014 until February 24, 2019, we and the local
satellite company “YES” were required to offer a fixed-price, narrow-base package at a price not to exceed NIS
120 (approximately €28) per month. Although such obligation was not extended, according to the Cable and
Satellite Council’s decision dated March 27, 2019, we and “YES” are entitled to continue to offer our customers
narrow packages at our option, for one year. Recently, HOT has sent a notice to the Cable and Satellite Council
about its intention to offer a narrow package (without sport channels).

We bolster our Israeli pay TV service offering by significant investments in procurement and co-development of
original local content which we undertake in partnership with local production partners and broadcast on our
proprietary suite of channels. We package such original and purchased content into a range of television channels
that we own and broadcast under the “HOT” brand to our television customers. The HOT suite of channels
includes HOT 3, HOT 8 where we broadcast our co-developed local content, HOT HBO, four movie channels,
the Israeli Entertainment Channel, sports channels and more than 10 children’s channels, which we believe are
highly popular in Israel, and run shows with top television ratings such as Zaguri Empire, Very Important Person,
Asfur, The Arbitrator, Shababnikim, Juda, Foolish, Golestar, Connected and Malcote. We also purchase rights to
broadcast popular foreign channels over our network. We believe the quality of content we provide over our
network generally, and the HOT television channels in particular, has been a critical factor in attracting new
customers, maintaining our existing customers and minimizing churn. Under existing regulations, we are subject
to certain ownership restrictions that limit the number of television channels we are permitted to own. In addition,
we are required by regulation to invest a minimum of 8% of our annual pay TV revenues from subscriber fees in
the production of original local content.

In 2017, we launched internet-based content packages intended to be viewed using smartphones, tablets and
computers under the Next TV brand, which include our local productions, movies and leading foreign series. As
of August 2017, we have also been marketing an internet-based content package which in addition to local and
foreign contents also includes over 40 channels for direct viewing, and may also be viewed on a television set.
Recently, HOT has launched a new OTT service, HOT TV, which is carried on the fiber network and is a full
service offering which includes the entire content offering of HOT, including all the linear channels and the VOD
service.

_Dominican Republic_

We offer pay television services through our HFC and FTTH broadband and xDSL networks and we also launched
our DTH TV services in regional areas covered by our mobile network in May 2017 enabling us to provide these
services near-nationwide. Our HFC and FTTH broadband networks, which pass through densely populated urban
areas, enable us to offer interactive digital services to most of our customers. In addition, we provide GPON-based
services to our high-value residential customers. We offer over 300 channels through a choice of five different
plans. Of those channels, approximately 60 are available in HD for basic packages with another 30 premium addon channels (such as HBO, Fox and MLB) available in HD for an additional fee, which we believe represents one
of the most extensive HD offerings available in the Dominican Republic as of March 31, 2021. Further, Altice
Dominicana is the exclusive distributor of NBA League Pass and NBA Channel. Pursuant to the agreement with
NBA, Altice Dominicana has full distribution rights in cable, TV Everywhere and DTH for access to residential
subscribers. In addition, Altice Dominicana is the exclusive rights holder of the NBA’s OTT mobile app NBA
TV, for commercialization to mobile subscribers on a la carte basis for postpaid mobile users, and also as a payas-you go for prepaid mobile users under the paquetico/recharge scheme.

_Others_

We also offer our broadband internet subscribers IPTV services via an unbundled xDSL network.

**_Broadband Internet Access and Fixed-Line Telephony_**

We provide broadband internet access and fixed-line telephony services across our cable (and in certain areas
xDSL) footprint, with a majority of homes passed outside of the Dominican Republic benefitting from download
speeds of at least 100 Mbps, and with a majority of homes passed in the Dominican Republic benefitting from


-----

download speeds of at least 200 Mbps. In the short-to-medium term, we expect that the portions of our networks
that are DOCSIS 3.0-enabled can offer download speeds of up to 500 Mbps with limited network and customer
premises equipment upgrades given the existing technological capability of our networks. This technological
capability can be realized with relatively low levels of capital expenditure and will enable us to better meet the
needs of our residential and business services customers who demand higher download speeds.

Our fixed-line telephony services are based on either PacketCable or VoIP technologies. We offer a wide range
of telephony packages and our triple-play offers tend to include flat-rate telephony packages with a significant
number of minutes of use included in the price. We provide national and international connectivity to our
customers either through our own interconnection capabilities or through our partners. We intend to phase out
stand-alone telephony packages as our strategy is to offer fixed-line telephony as an add-on product in our multiplay packages.

_Portugal_

Pursuant to our fiber rollout strategy in Portugal we reached 5,699,000 fiber homes passed as of March 31, 2021,
including 450,000 homes passed pursuant to our fiber sharing agreement with Vodafone Portugal (which is further
described below under “—Significant Contracts—Portugal—Fiber Sharing Agreement with Vodafone Portugal”).
In April 2020, we transferred our fiber assets including FTTH and dark fiber to FastFiber. On April 17, 2020, we
disposed of a 49.99% interest in FastFiber to Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners. In Portugal, we have also
tested NG-PON2 technology and despite the positive technical results of NG-PON2, XGS-PON became the
industry choice due to the better cost effectiveness. During 2021 the first commercial tests will be done with a
small group of friendly customers.

Over the last decade, total traffic for fixed-line telephony on our fixed-line network has decreased, primarily
because consumers have increasingly used mobile services instead of fixed-line services and due to the migration
of dial-up internet users to Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines (“ADSL”). The number of active mobile SIM
cards exceeds the number of fixed-line main lines in Portugal. We have responded to this trend by encouraging
the use of our fixed-line network for bundled services, including triple-play packages that include fixed-line
telephone services, broadband internet access and pay TV services.

Additionally, we are required to provide carrier selection to our customers for all kinds of traffic. Carrier selection
has been an additional factor that has contributed to the reduction in traffic on our network.

_Israel_

Internet service in Israel is structured into two segregated elements comprised of infrastructure or network access
services and ISP services. Infrastructure access service relates to access to the physical network infrastructure
within Israel that is required to connect the customer’s device to the infrastructure access provider’s operator. This
service is provided by us and Bezeq, the only telecommunication operators in Israel that own a national fixed-line
network infrastructure. In addition, Partner and Cellcom offer infrastructure access internet service in certain areas
over fiber optic infrastructures. ISP services, which can be provided by any licensed provider, consist of providing
access to the customer from the infrastructure provider’s operator, through its own operator, to the local and global
internet network. ISPs generally also provide certain value-added services such as data protection services,
security solutions, e-mail services and system administration services. A customer wishing to subscribe to internet
services in Israel effectively needs to purchase each of these services and may choose to subscribe to the broadband
internet infrastructure access facilities of us or Bezeq while using a separate ISP provider. Under the terms of our
ISP license, we are required to provide ISP services to any customer, including to customers of other broadband
internet infrastructure access providers, on equal terms. In October 2020, the Israeli Ministry of Communications
published a hearing according to which Bezeq and HOT’s licenses will be amended so that they will be entitled
to provide a full internet service including infrastructure and ISP service, subject to certain terms as detailed in
the hearing. On February 22, 2021, the Israeli Ministry of Communications published a secondary hearing which
includes certain amendments, including with respect to the effective date and the interim period. To date, no final
decision has been published on the subject. Further, since February 2015 Bezeq and HOT are required to provide
wholesale services to service providers, which enable them to offer a full internet service to their end-users
(infrastructure and ISP services). In June 2017, the Israeli Ministry of Communications set the maximum tariffs
for the provision of wholesale services over HOT’s network. On December 30, 2019, the Israeli Ministry of
Communications published a hearing regarding its intent to change the maximum tariffs method. In June 2020,
the Israeli Ministry of Communications approved HOT’s updated proposal for wholesale tariffs.


-----

We offer ultra-fast broadband internet infrastructure access services to our residential customers under our “HOT”
brand over our DOCSIS 3.0-enabled cable network which can support download speeds of up to 500 Mbps with
new customer premises equipment. Currently we offer our customers download speeds ranging from 200 Mbps
to 500 Mbps at competitive prices and our customers can choose from our single, double and triple-play packages
which include broadband internet infrastructure access services along with our television and fixed-line telephony
services. We provide ISP services under the “HOTnet” brand. Unlike our competitors who generally offer ISP
services at prices that increase depending on access speeds, we offer our ISP services at a competitive monthly
flat-rate irrespective of access speeds, which we believe make our ISP offerings very attractive. As of July 2020,
we are permitted to provide ISP services as part of a package together with our other multi-play packages, subject
to the approval of the Ministry of Communications for such packages.

As of April 2021, we also offer fiber-based internet services in speeds of up to 1 Gbps over IBC Israel’s (an entity
in which HOT acquired a 23.3% stake in September 2020) fiber optic network in certain areas where the network
had already been deployed. See “–Significant Contracts–Israel–Agreement with IBC Israel” for more information.

Fixed-line telephony in Israel is segregated into two separate services comprised of domestic fixed-line telephony
services and international long-distance services, each of which requires a separate license. We are currently
licensed to provide both. Our domestic license is valid until 2023 and our international license is valid until 2032,
and both may be extended for additional ten-year periods subject to the approval of the Israeli Ministry of
Communications.

We provide fixed-line telephony services using PacketCable technology on our secure cable network by offering
individual lines to our residential customers under our “HOT” brand, either on a stand-alone basis or as part of
our multi-play packages. Our services include several ancillary value-added features for end users such as caller
identity, call waiting and call waiting with caller identity, “follow me” (a call forwarding service enabling the user
to be reached on several phone numbers), conference calling, last call return, blocking of calls with no caller
identity, blocking of caller identity for outgoing calls and voicemail services.

_Dominican Republic_

In the Dominican Republic, we offer consumers broadband and fixed-line telephony services over our HFC, FTTH
broadband and xDSL networks. Our HFC and FTTH broadband networks which are 95.4% Docsis 3.0-enabled,
passed 833,600 homes in densely populated urban areas as of March 31, 2021, enabling us to offer current
download speeds of up to 200 Mbps, with launch of download speeds of up to 300 Mbps from the second quarter
of 2021. We selectively deployed new customer premise equipment in the first half of 2018 in order to support
our broadband internet service to eligible customers which increased download speeds up to 200 Mbps and can
also support further increases in download speeds up to 400 Mbps in the medium term. We also plan to leverage
the large spectrum allocations available to Altice Dominicana, which are technology neutral and enable high
mobile broadband speeds, by rolling out fixed wireless broadband access services through LTE and WTTX, in
regional areas covered by our mobile network to complement our broadband services over our HFC and FTTH
broadband networks concentrated in urban areas, thereby offering near-nationwide broadband coverage.

We offer both pre- and post-paid fixed-line telephony plans. While we continue to utilize our xDSL network to
provide fixed-line telephony services, we also offer VoIP to homes passed by our HFC and FTTH broadband
networks. We also leverage our wireless network to transmit fixed-line voice services.

**Mobile Services**

We operate mobile infrastructure in each of our geographies. The pre-paid subscriptions market represented 50.7%
of our residential mobile customer base as of March 31, 2021, while the post-paid subscriptions market
represented 49.3% of our residential mobile customer base as of March 31, 2021. Depending on geography and
network technology deployed, we offer 2G, 3G, 4G-LTE and/or 5G services on a variety of plans, from “no frills”
offers with no commitment or handset, to premium mobile telephony offers with varying voice and data limits, if
any, at attractive prices. In some of our markets, we provide wireless broadband plans through nomadic broadband
internet, giving customers access to our very-high-speed mobile networks.

**_Residential_**

We offered mobile services to approximately 10,159,000 total mobile B2C subscribers across our geographies as
of March 31, 2021. In Israel, due to regulations, previously we only offered our mobile services either on a stand

-----

alone basis or in a bundle with ISP or international call services. According to a regulatory amendment as of
February 2021, we are entitled to include our mobile services in our other multi-services packages, subject to the
approval of the Ministry of Communications for such packages. On May 30, 2021, the Ministry of
Communications approved the marketing of quad-play packages including triple-play services with HOT Net’s
ISP services and HOT Mobile’s mobile cellular services.

_Portugal_

In Portugal, in our residential customer segment, we offer a range of mobile products and services including: (i) a
variety of voice and data tariff plans, both prepaid and post-paid, designed to integrate unlimited voice and data
plans targeted at high-value post-paid customers and, in the prepaid market, to discourage migration to low-value
tariff plans by offering additional voice and data services; (ii) a portfolio of smartphones, including exclusive
handsets, with the capability to use an array of value-added and convergent services (mobile TV, music on demand,
navigation app, social network aggregator, cloud storage, etc.); and (iii) mobile broadband offers of up to 400
Mbps speed, using 4G technology and offering free access to our national WiFi network. We also offer prepaid
and discount products, which remain popular. As of March 31, 2021, approximately 46.2% of our Mobile B2C
subscribers were using prepaid mobile products in Portugal.

Our 4G offering currently allows: (i) speeds of up to 400 Mbps; (ii) access to live TV channels through Meo Go!,
a service that allows access to live TV channels on PCs, tablets, smartphones, Apple TV and Android TV set-top
boxes, complementary broadband coverage through ADSL/DTH, enabling customers to access our high speed
mobile broadband network in areas outside of our FTTH footprint; (iii) multi-play customers to access an
extensive catalog of music tracks through our multi-platform music streaming service, Meo _Music; (iv) Multi-SIM,_
for sharing of traffic among various devices, including PCs, through wireless dongles, tablets and smartphones;
and (v) Meo Drive, a navigation app available in iOS and Android marketplaces. Our 4G and 4G+ services are
respectively available to 99.6% and 89.6% of the Portuguese population as of March 31, 2021.

Following the launch of the M4O quad-play offering, MEO repositioned its voice and data tariff plans as a result
of which we offer four unlimited voice and tiered data bundles in the post-paid category, at different price points:
(i) the unlimited S, offering 500 MB of mobile internet, unlimited voice/SMS plus 250 minutes or SMS on all
other networks; (ii) the unlimited M, offering 1 GB of mobile internet plus unlimited voice and SMS and 500
minutes or SMS on all other networks; (iii) the unlimited L, offering 3 GB of mobile internet plus unlimited voice
and SMS on all networks; and (iv) the unlimited XL, offers 30 GB of mobile internet plus unlimited voice and
SMS. All of these plans include unlimited WiFi access, which otherwise costs an additional fee.

In the prepaid market, MEO extended its daily and weekly tariff plans offering a range of tariff plans from “zero
obligations” (daily plans without inclusive data) to frequent user plans (billed weekly with inclusive minutes and
SMS), in which the customer can choose add-on data services for a fee, to address consumers who opt not to enter
into post-paid loyalty contracts. MEO also extended the Moche offering targeted at customers below the age of
25. The _Moche_ tariff plans include minutes and SMS and enables the customer to choose a variety of data
allowances for different prices, and include traffic to a number of apps, including WhatsApp, Facebook and
Instagram.

MEO’s tariff structure was established in response to price movements in the market and is aimed at maintaining
MEO’s competitive position in the market. We believe that mobile services in Portugal are priced lower than the
European average and are among the lowest in Europe. Fixed-to-mobile and mobile-to-mobile interconnection
charges are regulated by ANACOM and have a significant impact on our business. Since 2005, when ANACOM
declared all mobile operators to have significant market power in call termination in the mobile networks market,
ANACOM has accordingly imposed price controls on interconnection rates for the termination of calls on mobile
networks. Since the imposition of price controls, interconnection rates have been reduced steadily. ANACOM has
issued successive decisions that have reduced mobile termination rates over time. In March 2012, ANACOM
issued a decision reducing mobile termination rates progressively to €0.0127/min by December 2012. In August
2015, ANACOM issued a further decision approving an additional reduction to €0.0083/min. ANACOM further
reduced the mobile termination rates to €0.0081/min. as of July 2016 and €0.0075/min. as of July 2017. On July 21,
2018, ANACOM approved its decision regarding the specification on price control obligations in the wholesale
market for voice termination on individual mobile networks (Market 2/2014). The maximum price to be applied
by the three mobile operators considered to have significant market power was set at €0.42/min., billed per second
from the first second and independent of the origin of the call. From July 1, 2019, that price decreased to
€0.40/min., following the yearly update of the inputs used in the model to determine such price. Moreover, on
September 18, 2018, ANACOM issued a decision reducing the fixed termination rate to €0.00047/min. In


-----

February 2020, ANACOM issued a decision fixing the call termination rate on fixed networks at €0.046 from
October 2020, and the call termination rate on mobile networks at €0.36 from July 2020. These reductions have
had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our interconnection revenues.

_Israel_

We provide mobile services in Israel to residential customers under the “HOT Mobile” brand mainly on our 5G,
UMTS and LTE networks. HOT Mobile competes with several principal mobile network operators, including
Cellcom, Partner, Pelephone and Golan Telecom, and MVNOs. The telecom market in Israel has changed
significantly in recent years to become more fragmented, including nine players in the mobile market, underlying
an increase of competition.

Due to regulations, previously we only offered our mobile services either on a stand-alone basis or in a bundle
with ISP or international call services. According to a regulatory amendment as of February 2021, we are entitled
to include our mobile services in our other multi-services packages, subject to the approval of the Ministry of
Communications for such packages. On May 30, 2021, the Ministry of Communications approved the marketing
of quad-play packages including triple-play services with HOT Net’s ISP services and HOT Mobile’s mobile
cellular services.

We offer residential subscribers packages of local calls (subject to fair usage), text messaging and internet access
for what we believe to be an attractive and competitive monthly fixed price as well as international calls to selected
destinations for an attractive fee. Prices for these services are subject to changes, predominantly driven by the
competitive nature of the Israeli telecommunications market. We also offer users pay-as-you-use packages, which
charge customers on a per-unit-used basis. Since the launch of our UMTS-based 3G mobile services in May 2012
and the launch of our UMTS prepaid services in April 2015, we added approximately 1,685,180 UMTS and LTE
subscribers in the residential market as of March 31, 2021.

_Dominican Republic_

In the Dominican Republic, we currently offer 2G, 3G and/or 4G-LTE services on a variety of pay-as-you-go and
monthly plans, from “no frills” offers with no commitment or handset, to premium mobile telephony offers with
varying voice and data limits, if any, at attractive prices. We are a pioneer in unlimited data and offer a
comprehensive range of data plans up to 125 GB, free unlimited data for social apps and exclusive access to
premium Over The Top Content apps such as HBO GO, NBA League Pass, Altice Music, and the VoD/OTT
proprietary Altice Play app, which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2019. In the pre-paid mobile segment,
our strategy focusses on a volume-driven approach aimed at increasing top-up frequency and value while
maintaining a healthy rate of customer growth. We also aim to monetize data service to offset a downward trend
in mobile voice and SMS usage. As such, we aim to continually offer customers innovative voice, SMS, data and
roaming add-ons to the core plans. We also offer a range of wireless broadband internet services (through dongles
and WiFi devices) and Flybox, our customer premises equipment, as well as capacity-based plans and voice and
data bundles on 3G and 4G-LTE.

We believe our strong footprint in areas with low mobile penetration positions us well to capture future growth.
As of March 31, 2021, we had a total of 2,831,000 mobile subscribers of which 2,205,000 subscribe through prepaid plans and 627,000 subscribe through post-paid plans. In the mobile market, Altice Dominicana mainly
competes with Claro (with which it shares a comparable spectrum range and 4G-LTE population coverage), and
with Viva in the low-end segment. Altice Dominicana also competes with niche actors Wind and Sky.

To service the Dominican Republic’s significant tourist traffic, we also provide users of foreign mobile
connections with international roaming services. We have entered into roaming agreements with various
international telecom service providers for voice, internet, data, pre-paid, roaming hub on 2G, 3G and 4G-LTE
services. Currently, we have agreements in place with leading international telecom companies from over 153
countries. We also attract international incoming traffic through our long-distance business.

-----

According to the Israeli Ministry of Communications’ decision dated April 18, 2019, we are entitled to offer to

_Dominican Republic_

We have a significant presence in the Dominican Republic’s business services market. We provide a variety of
mobile and fixed business telecommunication services in the Dominican Republic, focused on high margin
services in growth segments, with a high quality and diversified customer base. For our large commercial and
public enterprise customers business services typically include Cloud Services, Cybersecurity, SD-WAN, IoT,
VAS, M2M, SIP trunks, IP television, dedicated internet and data circuits and GPON-based services. For SMEs
and SOHOs we provide Cloud, Cybersecurity, Voice, TV, internet HFC-, FTTH- and DTH-based services.

We are growing our business services offerings and continue to roll-out new products and services. We have also
continued to expand our offerings to include data packages to distributed, launched value-added services and
additional features such as mobile-to-mobile connection services and enhanced data security. We service our
business services customers through a fiber GPON/FTTH network which we expect to build out opportunistically
depending on demand. The key areas of focus with respect to our business services business are to increase
penetration in the SOHO and SME segments while maintaining market share in the large, medium and public
client segment and to drive convergence levels of our business services by cross-selling our services. We also
have the platform ABC in our portfolio, exclusively for our business customers. This portal is the only convergent
portal in the Dominican Republic, through which, mobile services converge (Voice, Data & SMS) with fixed
voice services.

**Other Services**

We also offer a number of other services, depending on geography, such as bulk services to housing associations
and multiple dwelling unit managers, cloud storage, such as on-demand IaaS services, content production,
computer security services and storage and backup solutions. In various jurisdictions in which we operate, we also
generate revenues from selling advertising time to national, regional and local customers.

**_Content_**

We are focused on delivering high quality content offerings to complement our fixed and mobile services,
including proprietary content and exclusive content. For example, on June 12, 2017, Altice Europe had announced
a multi-year partnership with Netflix which allows customers to watch Netflix’s content with eligible devices in
Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic. Additionally, we have entered into an agreement with Netflix that
allows Altice Dominicana’s subscribers to access the Netflix app via its proprietary STB device dubbed Minibox.
In addition, Altice Dominicana offers Netflix codes giving free access to its subscribers to the Netflix service in
different combinations of two to 12 months. We also have a multiyear deal with Discovery channel that gives
Altice Dominicana rights to distribute the complete basic content offering of Discovery network on both its linear
content proposition, as well as TV Everywhere. At the end of 2015 and at the beginning of 2016, PT Portugal
entered into contracts with several first and second division football clubs in Portugal, including F.C. Porto,
Vitoria F.C., Rio Ave F.C. and Boavista F.C., to acquire the exclusive broadcasting rights for the home games of
these clubs for up to ten football seasons and in February 2017 we acquired a 25% stake in the capital of the
Portuguese sports broadcaster SPORT TV. In July 2018, PT Portugal entered into a new distribution agreement
with SPORT TV for a two-season period, the terms of which follow a similar methodology as the agreement
entered into in July 2016. In July 2020, PT Portugal entered into a new distribution agreement with SPORT TV
for a four-season period and for the sale of a portion of the broadcasting rights acquired at the end of 2015 and
the beginning 2016 relating to the football clubs F.C. Porto, Vitoria F.C., Rio Ave F.C. and Boavista F.C., for a
four-season period. See “—Significant Contracts—Portugal—Contracts with football clubs” for more information.
In addition, Altice Dominicana is the exclusive licensee for NBA on cable and mobile, as well as MLB for the
Extra Innings Package for digital and cable content broadcasting. We also intend to further develop and offer
proprietary content through our “HOT 3” channel (in Israel). We intend to continue to selectively invest in more
value-added premium content in the future in order to differentiate our telecoms bundles.

**_Media_**

Through Teads, we operate a leading, cloud-based, end-to-end technology platform that enables programmatic
digital advertising for a global, curated ecosystem of quality advertisers and their agencies and quality publishers.


-----

We operate in the Open Web outside of the Walled Gardens. As an end-to-end solution, our platform consists of
buy-side, sell-side, creative, data and artificial intelligence optimization modules. As a result, we have built deep
partnerships with both the demand and supply sides of digital advertising. For advertisers and their agencies, our
platform offers a single access point to buy the inventory of many of the world’s best publishers. Through
exclusive partnerships with these premium publishers, we enable customers to reach 1.9 billion unique monthly
users (as of April 2021),while improving the efficiency, quality and cost of digital ad transactions. For
approximately 3,100 publishers, we are a trusted monetization partner, providing the technology required to
monetize their most valuable ad inventory programmatically. By connecting both sides through our integrated
platform, known as the Teads Global Media Platform, we solve the digital programmatic advertising industry’s
most significant problems related to value chain fragmentation, inefficient digital advertising pricing and quality
and scale of inventory. We refer to the ecosystem enabled by Teads Global Media Platform as the Curated Internet.

Our platform is also capable of delivering display ads, which are the preferred advertising format for performanceoriented campaigns, as well as other web and app formats. We offer advertisers and their agencies access to highquality inventory at scale. Quality inventory, especially video inventory, is in short supply in digital advertising
so our Curated Internet solves a major problem for leading customers. Advertisers and their agencies can work
directly with us through our self-serve buying interface, Teads Ad Manager, or through third-party demand side
platforms. Regardless of how or where advertisers transact, they have access to our quality inventory sources on
behalf of our publisher partners. _Teads Ad Manager has the advantage of leveraging our machine learning_
prediction models, which are focused specifically on our publisher partners and our in-article placements. We use
our predictive machine learning algorithms to process large volumes of data based on thousands of campaigns to
deliver superior outcomes for customers. As a result, we believe we can offer significant cost efficiencies and
greater return on investment to agencies and advertisers who access our publisher partners’ inventory directly
through _Teads Ad Manager. On average in 2020,_ _Teads Ad Manager delivered 24% lower cost per thousand_
impressions, higher results on customers’ key performance indicators (including more than doubling the clickthrough rate and higher completion rate and viewability), and 100% more scale compared to demand side
platforms.

We enable publishers to monetize their digital advertising inventory through our Teads for Publishers platform,
which provides them with direct sale capabilities and is directly connected to our buy side interface, Teads Ad
_Manager. This full monetization platform is comprised of our proprietary supply side platform, ad exchange, ad_
server, video player, ad quality management, a comprehensive self-serve interface, full set of ad formats and
audience and other targeting capabilities. As a result, we are deeply embedded with our publisher partners, who
rely upon our technology platform to monetize their most valuable sources of ad inventory. Our platform allows
us to bring premium monetization to publishers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the number of our top
500 publishers retained from the prior period end (the “Publisher Retention Rate”) was approximately 99%. We
operate exclusive partnerships with over 80% of our publishers for their in-article video inventory, demonstrating
the value we deliver. Our longstanding publisher partnerships are aggregated into a highly curated version of the
Open Web that includes many of the world’s leading publishers like The BBC, ESPN, Meredith, The Guardian,
Bloomberg, The Washington Post, Vogue, L’Equipe, El Mundo, Der Spiegel, South China Morning Post and El
Universal. Our Curated Internet reaches 1.9 billion unique monthly users worldwide (as of April 2021) and
presents a significant value proposition to advertisers and agencies. As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately
3,100 editorial publishers on our platform, representing more than 15,000 web and app properties that provide
access to more than one trillion ad opportunities every year.

Our customers and publisher partners both have access to Teads Audiences, our suite of audience targeting features
that deliver accuracy and scale in audience targeting through utilizing first-, second- and third-party data. They
also have access to Teads Studio, our creative platform that provides a self-service creative production tool and
dynamic creative optimization capabilities.

We operate an efficient go-to-market strategy. Our primary customer, in most cases, is the advertising agency,
which can represent up to hundreds of advertisers, providing us an efficient point of contact to serve many
advertisers. For larger advertisers, we have a dedicated team that advises on utilizing our services for various
advertising needs, including leveraging our creative, data and research solutions. In these instances, we work very
collaboratively with such advertisers’ agencies. We also deploy a team exclusively focused on partnerships with
demand side platforms. We work with leading global advertisers across various verticals such as technology,
automotive, consumer packaged goods, finance and entertainment. Our number of customers, defined as
customers who spent at least $1,000 in the trailing 12-month period, grew to approximately 2,000 as of December
31, 2020. 91% and 94% of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020,


-----

respectively, came from customers that contributed more than $1,000 in trailing 12-month revenue. Our Gross
Customer Retention Rate was 94% for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020.

**_Customer Premises Equipment_**

In our residential fixed business, we believe advanced customer premises equipment is playing an increasingly
crucial role as it enhances customer experience by facilitating access to a wide range of user-friendly features,
offers a reliable channel for selling add-on and on-demand services, allows for multi-screen television viewing
and broadband internet usage by multiple parties and, when set-top boxes and modems are combined in one box,
allows cable operators to significantly reduce customer service expenses. Accordingly, we have continued to roll
out advanced set top boxes, in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic. Our innovative integrated set-top
boxes and cable routers developed by Altice Labs are offered to customers subscribed to our premium multi-play
packages. For example, Altice Labs has developed a fiber gateway device (joining the fiber modem together with
a home router) that enables a premium home network and WiFi experience by using the novel 802.11ax wireless
standard (now called WiFi 6), allowing set-top-boxes to be connected to this new gateway without the need for
physical cables. This gateway is part of an ecosystem that provides an enhanced WiFi experience with Smart
Mesh capabilities, enabling customers to access and control any of their networked equipment.

**Marketing and Sales**

Our marketing divisions use a combination of individual and segmented promotions and general brand marketing
to attract and retain subscribers. We market our business services to institutional customers and businesses such
as large corporates, governmental and administrative agencies, small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”),
nursing homes, hospitals and hotels. Our primary marketing channels are media advertising, including commercial
television, telemarketing, e-marketing, door-to-door marketing, billboards, newspaper advertising and targeted
mail solicitation. We continuously evaluate our marketing channels to allocate our resources most efficiently.

Our marketing strategy is based on increasing the penetration of multi-play services within our subscriber base,
increasing distribution of television-based value-added services and ensuring a high level of customer satisfaction
in order to maintain a low churn rate. We highlight our multi-play offerings in our marketing efforts and focus on
transitioning our analog and digital video-only customers to multi-play packages. We believe that customers who
subscribe for more than one service from us are significantly more loyal to us, thus reducing churn and associated
subscriber acquisition costs. Our marketing and sales efforts are always geared towards demonstrating the highquality and speed of our networks. In November 2015, we announced an exceptional partnership with Cristiano
Ronaldo, five-time World Footballer of the Year and the current captain of the Portuguese national team, whereby
he agreed to act as a brand ambassador across the markets in which we operate. Our partnership with Cristiano
Ronaldo is illustrative of our ambition for success and our desire for excellence across our brands.

We use a broad range of distribution channels to sell our products and services throughout our operations,
including retail outlets owned and run by the Group as well as third parties, dedicated sales booths, counters and
other types of shops, door-to-door sales agents, inbound and outbound telesales and our websites.

In Portugal, we market our residential services through approximately 1,200 points of sale as of March 31, 2021,
which include our own stores (managed either directly by us or by our partners or agents), shops in large retailers
and through separate dealers, which represent approximately 16%, 17% and 67% of the total points of sale,
respectively, as of March 31, 2021. In addition, we also market our residential services through door-to-door sales
and sales through our website. In Israel, our sales distribution channels include dedicated sales booths, which are
owned by the Group and some of which are operated by external dealers. Some of these sales booths also have
service centers and other dealer outlets. We also use telemarketing, operate a door-to-door sales team and make
sales through our website, and in the ultra-orthodox sector, we market our mobile services through an external
distributor. In the Dominican Republic, our distribution network comprises approximately 506 retail points of sale
as of March 31, 2021, including 35 stores owned and operated by Altice Dominicana, as well as dedicated sales
booths or kiosks operated in a number of stores owned by franchisees or dealers. Though still a minor channel,
online sales in the Dominican Republic are expected to grow as traffic on our website has been experiencing
strong growth and we have launched a new digital sales channel in the first half of 2020 that focuses on improving
the online sales experience of our customers.

We use a variety of brands, trade names and trademarks to market our services, including “Meo” and “M4O” in
Portugal, “HOT” in Israel and “Altice” in the Dominican Republic, in each case, several associated trademarks.


-----

We have been investing in digital marketing to accommodate for the consumption trends associated with new
media, which include a greater emphasis on mobile services, social media and digital video, and have leveraged
our digital profiling and segmentation capabilities in order to streamline our approach to new customer
acquisitions.

**Customer Contracts and Billing**

We typically enter into standard-form contracts with our residential customers. We review the standard rates for
our services on an on-going basis. In certain of our geographies, in addition to the monthly fees we charge,
customers generally pay an installation fee upon connecting or re-connecting to our cable network. The terms and
conditions of our contracts, including duration, termination rights, the ability to charge early exit fees, and the
ability to increase prices during the life of the contract, differ across our operations primarily due to the different
regulatory regimes our business is subject to in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Contracts with our
business services customers are standard form contracts or bespoke, negotiated contracts, depending on the nature
of the service.

We monitor payments and the debt collection process internally. We perform credit evaluation of our residential
and business services subscribers and undertake a wide range of bad debt management activities to control our
bad debt levels, including direct collections executed by our employees, direct collections executed in cooperation with third party collection agencies and pursuing legal remedies in certain cases.

**Customer Service**

Our customer service strategy is to increase customer satisfaction and decrease churn with high product quality
and dedicated service offered through locally and internationally operated service centers and personnel. We have
implemented initiatives aimed at improving our customers’ experience, including enhanced customer relationship
management systems, which allow us to better manage new subscribers, identify customers at risk of churning,
handle complex customer issues, offer special retention offers to potential churners and repayment plans to
insolvent customers. We aim to correlate sales incentives to churn, net promoter score (“NPS”) as opposed to
more traditional criteria of new sales, in order to refocus the organization away from churn retention to churn
prevention. In order to pro-actively address proper churn prevention, a dedicated task force was put in place in
2018, composed of top managers from different services (marketing, network, call center, etc.).

The customer service function for our fixed and mobile services is carried out by call centers located in Beer Shera,
Haifa, Nazareth, Nesher, Jerusalem and Migdal Ha’omek (servicing our Israeli customers) and Lisbon, Coimbra,
Porto, Évora, Beja, Santo Tirso e Castelo Branco (key call centers servicing our customers in Portugal). The
customer service function for our fixed and mobile services in the Dominican Republic is carried out by call
centers located in the free zone of Santiago for the commercial calls. The Technical Call Center for the Dominican
Republic (both for the fixed and mobile part) remains internal. Further, the Group has also started in-house
operations of certain call centers in Portugal through Intelcia Portugal Inshore, S.A. The Group has entered into a
shareholders’ agreement with the minority shareholders of Intelcia Portugal Inshore, S.A. which includes a put
and call option with the minority shareholders for the sale and purchase of a 35% stake in the entity. The option
can be exercised during the two-month period after December 31, 2022. Our customer care centers function has
an integrated system and utilize software programs that provide increased efficiencies and limited wait-times for
customers requiring support. Our field technicians and schedulers utilize the same software programs for
customers requiring in-person support. In most of the countries in which we operate, we provide service to our
customers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and we have systems that allow our customer care centers to be
accessed and managed remotely in the event that systems functionality is temporarily lost, which provides our
customers access to customer service with limited disruption. We also utilize our customer portal to enable our
customers to view and pay their bills online, obtain useful information and perform various equipment
troubleshooting procedures. Our customers may also obtain support through our on-line chat, e-mail functionality
and social media websites, including Twitter and Facebook.

Visits to customers’ premises are performed by a mix of in-house and outsourced technicians. In geographies
where we offer business services, our institutional and business subscribers are served by dedicated business
service and technical centers.

We have also launched and partially implemented initiatives aimed at improving our customers’ experience. These
initiatives include enhanced Customer Relationship Management systems, which allow us to better manage new


-----

subscribers, identify customers at risk of churning, handle complex customer issues, offer special retention offers
to potential churners and repayment plans to insolvent customers.

**Cloud and Cybersecurity Services**

Sociedade de Serviços de Gestão de Portais na Internet e de Consultoria de Empresas, S.A. (“SGPICE”), a
company in which PT OpCo holds 33.3% stake, offers a wide portfolio of private, public and hybrid cloud services.
Since 2011 we have offered IaaS services, which includes private servers, and SaaS services like email and M365.

business solutions, with cloud backup, disaster recovery, web content filtering and security operations center
solutions being the main offerings.

SGPICE supports a unique ecosystem of partnerships with the main market leaders, in various technological areas,
guaranteeing time to market, permanent updates and specialized support, and recently reinforced its partnership
with Acronis (Covilhã data center elected to the new Acronis data center in Portugal). Through this initiative,
Acronis has started to include Portugal in its worldwide network of data centers, providing backup and
cybersecurity services located in Portugal. This architecture in an operating expenditure model provides greater
competitiveness and agility.

**Network**

**_Portugal—Fixed_**

In Portugal, the PT Portugal Group owns a 50.01% stake in FastFiber, one of the largest FTTH networks by
penetration in Europe reaching approximately 5,699,000 fiber homes as of March 31, 2021, including
approximately 450,000 homes reached as a result of the fiber sharing agreement with Vodafone Portugal (which
is further described below under “—Significant Contracts—Portugal—Fiber Sharing Agreement with Vodafone
_Portugal”). We are generally able to offer download speeds of at least 100 Mbps but we also offer 200 Mbps, 400_
Mbps and 1 Gbps to a vast majority of homes passed in our footprint with limited network and customer premises
equipment upgrades across a substantial portion of our network. We are focused on increasing our investment in
fiber network, and through FastFiber we reached 5,699,999 homes passed (including homes accessed through
wholesale fiber operators) as of March 31, 2021. We also provide high-speed internet access through ADSL and
Ethernet (copper and FTTH). PT Portugal provides business services and residential services over the largest
IP/Multiprotocol Label Switching (“IP/MPLS”) backbone in Portugal, with almost 200 points of presence and a
total capacity of more than 230 Tbps (equivalent interfaces) and high-speed 10/100 Gbps interfaces. Our fiber
backbone supports transmission services directly over fiber cables or using Dense Wavelength Division
Multiplexing (“DWDM”) technology with a total capacity of more than 83 Tbps (equivalent ports) and high speed
10/100 Gbps interfaces and automatic restoration, SDH technology or IP/MPLS technology.

We own an IP/MPLS International Backbone co-located with the key Internet exchange points, namely in Miami,
Washington, Madrid, London (two sites), Amsterdam and Frankfurt, with a total capacity of more than 26 Tbps
(equivalent interfaces), with direct peering to more than 650 ISPs worldwide and direct transmission to three tier
1 and one leading transit provider. We have equity interests in eight international submarine cable consortiums
with a total length of 155,000 km and a transport capacity of 250 Gbps, six of which have landing points in
Portugal (Sesimbra, Carcavelos and Seixal), and own a total of approximately 6,380 km of domestic cables with
a transport capacity of 1 Tbps between the Portuguese mainland and the islands of Azores and Madeira. This data
transmission network provides high capacity, flexibility and security and can progressively incorporate current
data infrastructures at lower costs than alternative networks.

Following a public tender launched by ANACOM in 2008, our subsidiary PT OpCo was granted the frequency
usage rights for DTT associated with the transmission of the signal for free-to-air television programs, the so

-----

called “Multiplex A” or “Mux A”. This right allows us to have national geographic extension and is valid until
December 2023. There is a coverage obligation associated to the right of frequency use, namely 87.2% of national
territory covered by terrestrial platform (Mux A) and 12.8% by complementary means (satellite). In May 2013,
ANACOM decided that the single frequency network, due to changes in spectrum international planning (700
MHz band), will evolve to a Multi Frequency Network (“MFN”) topology. DTT refarming was executed and
concluded in 2020 releasing the 700 MHz band used. The now former DTT band is subject to 5G auction that is
still in place.

We launched DTT (using DVB-T, or terrestrial signals) in 2009 and by the end of 2011, we achieved 100%
coverage of the Portuguese population (using approximately 90% DVB-T and 10% DVB-H (satellite signals)).
DTT only encompasses broadcasting of free-to-air television programs, while our MEO offering comprises both
free-to-air television programs, as well as pay TV channels provided over FTTH, ADSL and DTH technologies.

We continued PSTN consolidation, with the migration of customers to the renewed and virtualized IMS solution.
Since 2015 to 2020, we have already consolidated 43% of PSTN switches, thus reducing the associated operational
costs and allowing customers access to new services.

**_Portugal—Mobile_**

We provide mobile telephone services using GSM, UMTS, LTE and NR technologies (2G, 3G and 4G
respectively). Within our GSM offering, we provide services in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz band spectrums.
Following a multiband auction for LTE technology spectrum, ANACOM formally allocated to us rights to the 2
× 10 MHz in the 800 MHz band, 2 × 20 MHz in the 1800 MHz band and 2 × 20 MHz in the 2.6 GHz band, each
for 15 years. These rights are reflected in a license that includes and supersedes our previous GSM and UMTS
licenses and which imposes certain requirements on us, including MVNO, national roaming and coverage
obligations with respect to our 800 MHz spectrum. The backhaul for our 2G, 3G and 4G networks is provided
through IP technology. Overall, approximately 97% of the sites are served by fiber optic as of March 31, 2021,
and 3% of sites are using Microwave solutions. Our 2G, 3G and 4G networks cover approximately 99.8%, 96.6%
and 99.6% of the population, respectively, as of March 31, 2021. Currently, our mobile network supports the
following radio capacities: 2G/GSM: EDGE (240 Kbps); 3G/UMTS: HSPA+ Carrier Aggregation (42 Mbps);
and 4G/LTE: Carrier Aggregation (900 Mbps).

Since 2019 we have carried out the technological renewal of mobile voice and packet data solutions, in a
virtualized environment to allow greater agility and scalability, also guaranteeing the ability to provide new
services such as VoLTE.

Through roaming agreements, our subscribers can make and receive mobile calls throughout Europe and in many
other countries around the world. As of March 31, 2021, we have entered into roaming agreements with
approximately 660 operators in 220 countries.

On October 22, 2019, ANACOM approved a draft decision on the designation of the 700 MHz band for electronic
communications services, limiting the number of rights of use of frequencies to be allocated in the 700 MHz, 900
MHz, 1800 MHz, 2.1 GHz bands, 2.6 GHz and 3.6 GHz, subject to an auction procedure. On December 23, 2019,
ANACOM approved the decision on the designation of the 700 MHz band for terrestrial electronic
communications services, caps on the number of rights of use of frequencies to be allocated in the 700 MHz, 900
MHz, 1800 MHz, 2.1 GHz, 2.6 GHz and 3.6 GHz bands, as well as the definition of the respective allocation
procedure. Under the terms of that decision, ANACOM concluded that a competitive selection process, in this
case an auction, appeared to be most appropriate for selecting the entities to which the corresponding rights of use
of frequencies may be allocated. At the same time, by decision of October 31, 2019, ANACOM approved the start
of the procedure for preparing the Auction Regulation for the allocation of rights of use of frequencies in the
aforementioned bands. The Auction Regulation was approved in October 2020. Under the terms of the Auction
Regulation, PT OpCo submitted its application, which was approved. A bidding phase exclusive for new entrants
started on December 22, 2020 and ended in early January 2021. The main bidding phase started on January 14,
2021 and is still in progress. This process is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2021. This complies
with the EU strategy for the “Digital Single Market”, which recommended a coordinated introduction at the EU
level to encourage investment in high-speed broadband networks and to facilitate the proliferation of advanced
digital services, in particular by highlighting the need to ensure the provision of broadband services in rural areas.

Following the completion of the Portuguese Towers Transaction, PT OpCo entered into a 20-year agreement with
OMTEL for the use of the above-mentioned 2,961 sites and the other sites to be built, for a monthly fee dependent


-----

on the type and location of each site. In addition, a build-to-suit agreement for 400 new sites was signed between
PT OpCo and OMTEL.

In Portugal, the 5G spectrum auction started on December 22, 2020 and the main auction is ongoing. The expected
allocation of rights of use for frequencies is scheduled for the third quarter of 2021.

**_Israel—Fixed_**

We provide our fixed services through our extensive fully-owned cable network which passes most of Israel’s
2.2 million households and which we believe is one of most technologically advanced networks in the EMEA
region. We rolled out 36,000 and 37,000 homes passed in Israel in 2019 and 2020, respectively, with an additional
11,000 homes in the three months ended March 31, 2021. We own one of the largest fiber/cable networks by
penetration that passed 2.2 million homes as of March 31, 2021. The fiber-rich characteristic of our network,
which is fully DOCSIS 3.0-enabled, generally provides speed up to 500 Mbps and other advantages as compared
to copper-based xDSL networks. Our network allows fiber optic transmission services using DWDM technology,
SDH technology or IP technology. We completed the migration process of switching telephony customers to a
new telephony environment based on Genband (Class 4) and Broadsoft (Class 5) switches with advanced SIP
switch which is used to create and control communication sessions over an IP network. We are currently upgrading
our cable network to advanced technologies, including by way of segmentation by deploying fibers closer to the
subscribers’ homes, in order to allow for expansion of the transmission capacity on the network. Part of our cable
network runs through ducts and poles owned by Bezeq and we are party to certain continuing arrangements with
Bezeq relating to their use.

In September 2020, we entered into an IRU agreement with IBC Israel according to which we are committed to
purchase indefeasible right of use in IBC Israel’s fiber optic infrastructure lines in a certain percentage, increasing
gradually, of the customers houses in buildings connected to IBC Israel’s network. See “—Significant Contracts—
_Israel—Agreement with IBC Israel” for more information._

**_Israel—Mobile_**

We provide mobile telephony services using 5G, GSM, UMTS and LTE technology (2G, 3G, 4G, 4G-LTE and,
from September 2021, also 5G NSA) which has enabled us to compete effectively in the mobile services market
as we are able to provide up-to-date services to customers, including faster data transmission services (up to 2,000
Mbps) with a higher data rate. As of March 31, 2021, our mobile network provides 4G coverage to 99% of the
population of Israel.

Our GSM/UMTS/LTE/5G network is operated and maintained by PHI (as defined below) and is among the most
advanced nationwide networks in Israel. When we originally launched our mobile services in Israel in May 2012,
we had relied on Pelephone’s network to provide in-country roaming services to our customers in areas not
covered by our UMTS network. On July 2, 2014, the Israeli Ministry of Communications initiated a tender process
for 4G-LTE frequencies comprising a total of eight frequency bands in the area of 1,800 MHz to enable delivery
of mobile services using LTE technology. The process was concluded on August 9, 2015, when two frequency
bands at the width of 5 MHz in the 1.8 GHz were allocated to HOT Mobile, as a result of which HOT Mobile
launched its LTE service.

The Network Sharing Agreement with Partner was approved by the Israeli Antitrust Authority and the Israeli
Ministry of Communications on April 20, 2015 and is valid until December 31, 2028, and provides for automatic
renewals in five-year increments after December 31, 2028. Pursuant to the Network Sharing Agreement, HOT
Mobile shares 15 MHz in the 1.8 GHz, providing a total capacity of 20 MHz in the 1.8 GHz area. For further
details, please see “—Significant Contracts—Israel—Mobile Network Sharing Agreement with Partner in Israel”.
HOT Mobile also has a number of roaming contracts with cellular companies outside of Israel that provide our
3G and LTE customers with international roaming capabilities. For further details, please see “—Significant
_Contracts—General—Agreements relating to mobile roaming services”._

In July 2019, the Israeli Ministry of Communications published a tender for LTE and 5G frequencies in the 700
MHz, 2,600 MHz and 3,400 MHz areas. The tender offered in total 22 frequency range units in the 700 MHz, 2.6
GHz, 3.6-3.8 GHz and 3.5-3.6 GHz areas. Within the scope of the tender, the Ministry of Communications offered
certain incentives to the operators, including the postponement of license fees payment until January 2022, the
possibility to decrease frequency fees and grants that are subject to compliance with certain deployment milestones.


-----

The 5G spectrum auction bid was completed on August 12, 2020. According to the results of the auction as
announced by the Ministry of Communications on August 16, 2020, HOT together with Partner won the following
spectrum (to be divided between HOT and Partner in equal parts):

        - two bands of 700 MHz (10 MHz each band);

        - two bands of 2,600 MHz (20 MHz each band); and

        - 10 bands of 3,500 MHz (10 MHz each band).

The total price of the 5G spectrums is NIS 62,380,000, to be paid by HOT and Partner in equal parts, in September
2022. After completion of the required preconditions, on September 29, 2020 the spectrums were allocated to
HOT and HOT’s license was amended to allow the operation of 5G network. We launched 5G services in the first
quarter of 2021 in certain areas in Israel.

**_Dominican Republic—Fixed_**

Our fixed network is generally designed with fiber architecture (both HFC and FTTH) that has proven to be highly
flexible in meeting the increasing needs of our customers. We rolled out approximately 10,000 homes passed in
the Dominican Republic in 2019 (all HFC) and approximately 22,000 homes passed in 2020 (of which
approximately 13,000 were HFC and 9,000 were FTTH), with an additional 10,000 homes (of which 2,000 were
HFC and 9,000 were FTTH) in the three months ended March 31, 2021. As of March 31, 2021, we delivered
fiber/cable services to approximately 796,000 homes in the Dominican Republic primarily in urban areas,
including Santo Domingo, Santiago, San Francisco, La Vega, La Romana, Nagua, Samaná, La Altagracia
(touristic zones of Bayahibe and Bavaro) and San Pedro de Macoris, and also a small deployment in Peravia
(touristic project Puntarena). As of March 31, 2021, we had upgraded 95.5% of our HFC and FTTH broadband
networks to bi-directional capability, with a substantial majority of homes passed on 750 MHz or 1,000 MHz. Our
HFC and FTTH broadband networks extend over 7,285 kilometers and include approximately 1,676 kilometers
of optical fiber and 2,969 optical nodes with up to a maximum of 750 homes served by each optical node in our
network. We believe that our HFC broadband network is currently underutilized and there is substantial room for
increased penetration within our existing footprint without significant additional investment in the network. As of
May 31, 2021, we service our business services customers through a fiber GPON network including 220 OLTS
and 1,211 active ports. We are gradually migrating our xDSL customers to our HFC and FTTH or fixed wireless
network according to the availability of our networks.

Though tropical storms, hurricanes and earthquakes are frequent in the Dominican Republic, our fiber network,
which we estimate is 90% above ground, benefits from high redundancy (notably self-healing rings).

**_Dominican Republic—Mobile_**

We offer our mobile services through our 2G GSM/GPRS, 3G UMTS/HSPA and 4G-LTE mobile access network
comprising approximately 1,680 antenna sites with approximately 1,617 2G GSM/GPRS base stations (BTS),
approximately 1,392 3G UMTS/HSPA base stations (node-B) and 1,677 4G-LTE mobile base stations as of March
31, 2021. We achieved 97.5% population coverage through our 2G network, which is fully EDGE capable, 96.2%
population coverage through our 3G network and 97.5% population coverage through our 4G network as of March
31, 2021. Our 2G, 3G and 4G services are capable of supporting mobile download speeds of up to 0.1 Mbps, 10
Mbps and 100 Mbps, respectively.

We are continuing to invest in our mobile network, including beginning the migration to the latest generation
equipment (“Single-RAN”) in April 2018, which enables 2G, 3G and 4G technology to be managed by means of
a single item of equipment, and by connecting an increasing numbers of sites (currently 68% with fiber). SingleRAN technology enables our subscribers to benefit from a high-quality, very-high-speed network and offers
certain other economic benefits, particularly due to the reduced amount of equipment necessary in our mobile
network. In the Dominican Republic, the 5G spectrum auction was launched by Indotel (the Dominican Republic
regulator) on February 9, 2021 and the auction is ongoing. The expected allocation of rights of use for frequencies
is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2021.

All of our mobile towers are Category 3 hurricane proof (resistant to sustained winds of 209-251 km/h) and have
a back-up energy system (battery, generators, or both).


-----

On October 3, 2018, we announced the closing of the Dominican Towers Transaction. Altice Dominicana sold its
100% stake in the tower company Teletorres del Caribe, comprising 1,039 sites operated by Altice Dominicana
to Phoenix Tower International. In addition, Altice Dominicana as tenant also entered into a 20-year master
agreement with Teletorres del Caribe. See “—Significant Contracts—Dominican Republic—Agreement to
_Dispose of Dominican Tower Assets”._

**Suppliers**

We globalize and streamline our procurement processes by combining our aggregate purchasing power to leverage
the combined scale of the Altice Europe Group and negotiate more favorable pricing and other commercial terms
from suppliers. We believe that this has allowed us to realize significant cost savings. However, while we progress
the globalization of our procurement functions, our businesses continue to purchase certain products and services
under locally negotiated contracts, for example, due to the need for geography-specific products and services.

We have relationships with a number of suppliers across our geographies that provide us with hardware, software
and various other products and services necessary to operate our businesses. In the Dominican Republic we have
a strategy of supplier diversification in a number of different areas, thus mitigating the potential impact in terms
of deliveries and eventual price effects. In Portugal and Israel, we have been constantly monitoring the market
evolution and introducing supply chain adaptations to better deal with such scenarios. Our proactive approach has
driven us to implement several actions during last year in order to significantly increase our supply chain resilience
to deal with such situations without major disruptions. These improvements have been permanently under
adaptations as the situation evolves, and some of these improvements are as follows:

        - collaborative planning with vendors, providing better long term visibility with wider forecasting
horizons;

        - anticipation of purchase orders, according to revised lead times, while keeping stock levels
under control;

        - revision of CPE commercial rules, adapting the demand to the availability on each CPE type,
while fulfilling the overall market needs;

        - temporary reduction of capillarity on the maintenance distribution channels, still ensuring
proper S&M levels while reducing stock dispersion and keeping the necessary availability to
fully sustain out commercial performance; and

        - reinforcement of used equipment retrieval and corresponding refurbishment.

We are also constantly revising our whole supply chain in order to anticipate shortage risks or transportation
delays. We use a limited number of subcontractors to maintain our network, operate our call centers and supply,
install and maintain installed consumer and on-site business and public sector terminals, with the Group’s
employees performing only a small portion of installations. Certain services can be self-installed by our customers,
but most still require a professional installer. Our agreements with third-party providers generally require
subcontractors to maintain certain quality levels and use trained personnel, and we monitor the efficiency and
quality of these services on a regular basis.

**_Customer Premises Equipment_**

We purchase set-top boxes and other customer premises equipment from a number of suppliers. We purchase the
integrated set-top boxes from Sagemcom, among others, for use across our operations. Moreover, Altice Labs has
developed a fiber gateway device (joining the fiber modem together with a home router) that enables the evolution
of the home network environment into a new WiFi experience by using the novel 802.11ax wireless standard (now
called WiFi 6) allowing set-top-boxes to be connected to this new gateway without the need for any cable. This
same gateway is part of an ecosystem that provides an enhanced WiFi experience to the customer giving the power
to control the access of any equipment, and establishing rules and policies to use the WiFi connectivity using
Smart Mesh capabilities.


-----

**_Network Connectivity and Mobile Operations_**

We have entered into a number of interconnection agreements with fixed-line and mobile telephony operators in
the geographies in which we operate. In certain countries, such as Israel, we have also entered into agreements
providing for domestic roaming services and other roaming agreements with foreign mobile operators. We may
also look to third-party suppliers for network infrastructure solutions and have entered into agreements with a
number of key mobile device manufacturers.

**_Content_**

We obtain television content, including premium channels, from the Altice TV division of the Altice France Group
and a number of national and international suppliers, and purchase rights to broadcast channels on our network
and content for our TV services. In Israel, we contract with suppliers for the purchase of television programming
content that we package and broadcast under the HOT suite. We also purchase rights to broadcast content for our
VoD service. See “—Other Services—Content” above for additional information regarding our recent investments
in, and partnerships with, new content suppliers. Also see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions”
for more information.

Several different relationships govern the content that we provide to our cable television subscribers. The terms
and conditions of our contracts governing the payments and content providers of copyright fees to broadcasters
vary by jurisdiction. We also enter into transportation and distribution agreements with commercial broadcasters.
Through transportation contracts, we agree to carry a commercial broadcaster’s signal across our fiber backbone
to our head-end stations, where the signal is subsequently delivered to our subscribers. Broadcasters who transmit
their signal to us by satellite can elect to deliver their signal directly to our head-end stations and, as a result, do
not need to enter into a transportation agreement with us. We also enter into distribution arrangements with all of
the commercial broadcasters whose channels we carry on our networks, pursuant to which we agree to carry the
broadcaster’s signal from the head-end station to our cable television subscribers. A variety of compensation
arrangements have been made in respect of the contracts we enter into with the commercial broadcasters. In some
situations, we do not charge the broadcasters any fee for transmitting their signal to our subscribers. Instead, the
broadcasters benefit from increased advertising revenue they receive from reaching our basic cable television
subscribers and we benefit by providing our subscribers added content. In certain situations, we pay broadcasters
for the channels they transmit over our network. In other instances, we have entered into revenue-sharing
arrangements or subscriber-based fixed fees. In addition to these arrangements, we have also entered into contracts
with certain broadcasters pursuant to which we currently pay a fee in order to have the right to broadcast their
signal on any digital cable television service that we may offer in the future.

We pay copyright and carriage fees to the foreign, national and thematic broadcasters carried on our cable
television networks. In general, these fees are paid in part to copyright collection agencies and to broadcasters
based on a combination of per program fees and the number of subscribers to our cable service. We also typically
pay royalties based on our subscribers’ usage of on-demand content.

**Significant Contracts**

The agreements described below are significant to the Group. The summary of each agreement set forth below is
an overview of certain material terms of such agreement as in effect as of the date hereof.

**_General_**

_Interconnection agreements_

Interconnection is the means by which users of one telephony network are able to communicate with users of
another telephony network and, as the case may be, through a third telephony network. For a subscriber located
on one telephony network to complete a telephone call to an end-user served by another telephony network, the
subscriber’s network service provider must interconnect either to the end-user’s network, or to the network that
transfers the call to the end-user’s network. Typically, the network transferring the call and the end-user’s network
charge the subscriber’s service provider a fee to transfer or to terminate the communication. Interconnection fees
are typically regulated by the telecommunications regulator in each of the countries in which we operate.
Regulators also commonly impose on all participants in the fixed-line telephony and mobile telephony markets
an obligation to negotiate in good faith interconnection agreements with every requesting operator who is seeking


-----

to provide a publicly available electronic communication service. Generally, the cost of interconnection fees that
we pay is taken into account in the price we charge our subscribers.

We have entered into various domestic and international reciprocal interconnection agreements for our fixed-line
telephony, mobile operations and ILD services with other providers of electronic communications services. Our
interconnection agreements generally have terms that continue for the duration of the parties’ licenses to pursue
telecommunication activities and may be terminated in the event of a material breach or the commencement of
liquidation or insolvency proceedings.

_Agreements relating to mobile roaming services_

Currently, we receive roaming services around the world from various network operators. Our roaming
agreements enable our mobile customers to access other mobile networks while abroad. Although the particular
terms depend on the country in which roaming services are accessed, the agreements regulate billing and
accounting, settlement procedures, customer care, technical aspects of the roaming agreement, security and
connectivity. The agreements may be terminated in the event of a material breach or the commencement of
liquidation or insolvency proceedings, among other things.

**_Portugal_**

_Agreements governing the reciprocal sharing of broadcasting rights with Portuguese competitors_

In July 2016, PT Portugal reached an agreement with certain other Portuguese telecom operators, such as NOS
Comunicações, NOS Audiovisuais, Vodafone Portugal and Cabovisão (currently Nowo), for the reciprocal
sharing of broadcasting rights of football-related content for a period of eight years, with the cost of such
broadcasting rights split among all operators based on their market share. Accordingly, PT Portugal pays its
competitors a portion of the distribution and broadcasting rights based on PT Portugal’s market share, and is
entitled to recharge other operators the cost of its own exclusive broadcasting rights based on the market share of
such operators.

_Distribution agreement with SPORT TV_

In July 2016, PT OpCo entered into a distribution agreement with the Portuguese sports premium channel SPORT
TV for a two-season period, pursuant to which PT Portugal committed to pay a non-contingent fixed price plus
an additional variable fee component based on the number of subscribers and penetration rate. PT OpCo’s
subsequent acquisition of a 25% stake in SPORT TV, as described under “—Significant Investments and
_Dispositions”, did not affect the parties’ respective rights and obligations under this agreement. In July 2018, PT_
OpCo entered into a new distribution agreement with SPORT TV for a two-season period, the terms of which
follow a similar methodology as the previous agreement. In July 2020, PT OpCo entered into a new distribution
agreement with SPORT TV for a four-season period, pursuant to which PT Portugal committed to pay a noncontingent fixed price plus an additional variable fee component based on the number of subscribers and
penetration rate. Also in July 2020, PT OpCo entered into an agreement for the sale of a portion of the broadcasting
rights acquired at the end of 2015 and the beginning 2016 relating to the football clubs F.C. Porto, Vitoria F.C.,
Rio Ave F.C. and Boavista F.C., for a four-season period.

_Contracts with football clubs_

At the end of 2015 and in the beginning of 2016, PT Portugal had entered into contracts with several first and
second division football clubs in Portugal, including F.C. Porto, Vitoria F.C., Rio Ave F.C. and Boavista F.C.,
and three second division clubs. Under these contracts, we (i) acquired the exclusive broadcasting rights for the
home games of these clubs for up to ten football seasons for certain clubs, (ii) acquired the broadcasting rights of
“Porto Canal” (F.C. Porto’s own TV channel) for a period of twelve and a half years from January 2016 onwards
and (iii) entered into sponsorship agreements for periods of up to ten football seasons. The total value of these
contracts amounts to €620 million (excluding VAT). The amounts payable under these contracts may change
depending on the rank of the teams at the end of the season, particularly in case of promotion or relegation.
Existing key agreements include:

(i) The agreements entered into with F.C. Porto, F.C. Porto-Futebol SAD and FCP Media, under which we
(i) acquired the broadcasting rights of the games of these clubs for ten seasons (2018/2019 to 2027/2028),
(ii) acquired the broadcasting rights of the Porto Canal for a period of twelve and a half years (January


-----

2016 to June 2028) and (iii) obtained sponsorship rights for seven and a half seasons (January 2016 to
June 2023).

(ii) The agreement entered into with Vitoria Sport Clube-Futebol SAD under which we (a) acquired the
broadcasting rights of the games of these clubs for ten seasons (2018/2019 to 2027/2028) and
(b) obtained sponsorship rights for ten seasons (2018/2019 to 2027/2028).

(iii) The agreement entered into with Rio Ave Futebol Clube-Futebol SDUQ, Lda, under which we
(i) acquired broadcasting rights for the games of this club for ten seasons (2018/2019 to 2027/2028) and
(ii) obtained sponsorship rights for twelve and a half seasons (January 2016 to June 2028).

(iv) The agreement entered into with Boavista F.C.-Futebol SAD, under which we acquired broadcasting
rights for the games of this club for ten seasons (2016/2017 to 2025/2026).

_Fiber Sharing Agreement with Vodafone Portugal_

In July 2014, we signed an agreement with Vodafone Portugal to deploy, swap capacity and share fiber networks
beginning in December 2014, for an initial term of 25 years. The initial term automatically renews for four year
increments unless a party provides written objection to a renewal two years in advance of the termination date.
The agreement includes sharing of dark fiber in approximately 900,000 homes, where each party grants to the
other party an exclusive IRU for certain PON network cells it owns (totaling approximately 450,000 homes each).
Since the model is based on a swap of capacity through IRUs, the title to the PON network cells remains with the
granting party, which allows both parties to maintain full autonomy and flexibility in designing retail offers,
including the provision of RF (analog) TV signal, and will ensure confidentiality of customer information.

During the first ten years of the agreement, there is an undertaking of partnership between the parties for the
construction of new PON network cells. A party must notify the other party if it wishes to build new PON network
cells in any geographical area which does not correspond to the PON network cells already covered by the
agreement. If the other party is also willing to build new PON network cells, both parties must then commit to the
construction of new PON network cells in partnership with each other. This undertaking from each party does not
apply after the first ten years of the agreement, nor when a party decides to build PON network cells in partnership
with another operator (provided that such PON network cells are not covered by the agreement).

Additionally, each party may transfer the entirety (but not part) of its PON network cells covered by the agreement
to a third-party purchaser, provided that such purchaser also assumes the obligations of the selling party under the
agreement. The non-selling party has a pre-emption right where the third party purchaser is a retail operator in the
broadband market, which is not in the same “economic group” as the seller. If the selling-party does not comply
with the conditions to transfer and the pre-emption right, it will be subject to a penalty. In the event of a material
and/or continuous default of one party, the other party may unilaterally terminate the agreement by exercising a
call option.

Pursuant to the Altice Portugal FTTH Transaction, this agreement has been transferred to FastFiber.

_Agreement to Dispose of Portuguese Tower Assets_

On July 18, 2018, PT Portugal reached an agreement with a consortium including Morgan Stanley Infrastructure
Partners and Horizon Equity Partners for the sale of a 75% stake in the newly incorporated tower company called
OMTEL, comprising PT OpCo’s mobile telecommunications passive infrastructure corresponding to 2,961 sites
previously operated by PT OpCo. The transaction valued this tower business at an enterprise value of €660 million.
The purchase price of €648 million included a cash consideration for the disposal of the 75% stake in the amount
of €540 million and the acquisition of a 25% stake in OMTEL by PT Portugal measured at a fair value of
€108 million. The agreement with the consortium includes an additional deferred payment based on an earn-out
structure upon exit by the consortium.

In connection with this transaction, PT OpCo entered into a 20-year agreement with OMTEL for the use of the
above-mentioned 2,961 sites and the other sites to be built, for a monthly fee dependent on the type and location
of each site. In addition, a build-to-suit agreement for 400 new sites was signed between PT OpCo and OMTEL.


-----

On January 2, 2020, PT Portugal sold its 25% equity interest in OMTEL to Cellnex Telecom SA for total cash
proceeds of approximately €200 million, as part of a larger transaction pursuant to which Cellnex acquired 100%
of the share capital of OMTEL.

**_Agreement to dispose of 49.99% interest in FTTH assets in Portugal_**

On December 12, 2019, PT Portugal entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners
regarding the sale of a 49.99% interest in PT OpCo’s fiber business, comprising of the fiber passive infrastructure
assets and rights, related contracts and underlying agreements, thereby creating a nationwide fiber wholesaler in
Portugal. In April 2020, we carved-out the fiber business into a dedicated wholesale vehicle FastFiber. On April
17, 2020, we disposed of a 49.99% interest in FastFiber to Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners for cash
consideration of €1,576 million received at closing, with additional €375 million to be received in December 2021
and, subject to certain performance ratchets, a further €375 million to be received in December 2026.

The shareholders’ agreement provides for, among other things, a board of directors, which comprises of five
members, with three directors appointed by PT Portugal and two directors appointed by Morgan Stanley
Infrastructure Partners, subject to change based on the parties’ percentage of ownership interests in FastFiber. The
shareholders’ agreement also establishes customary minority protective rights and provides that certain specified
decisions are not permitted to be made without the consent of at least one director appointed by Morgan Stanley
Infrastructure Partners or the consent of Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners in the shareholders’ general
meeting, as applicable, subject to certain conditions including a minimum ownership percentage by Morgan
Stanley Infrastructure Partners. The shareholders’ agreement also contains customary provisions regarding
restrictions on the transferability of shares in FastFiber, rights of first refusal and rights of first offer and antidilution rights, in addition to an agreed dividend policy.

Pursuant to the Altice Portugal FTTH Transaction, PT OpCo has entered into a 25-year agreement with FastFiber,
renewable for five-year periods, for the usage of carved-out fiber network, composed of both the dark fiber and
also the FTTH and FTTE networks. FastFiber has also entered into a deployment and maintenance agreement of
the fiber network.

**_Israel_**

_Agreement with the State of Israel relating to ownership of our cable network_

In July 2001, our predecessor companies entered into an agreement with the State of Israel pursuant to which they
agreed to waive all claims against the State of Israel arising out of the grant of a satellite broadcast license to
D.B.S. Satellite Services (1998) Ltd, an associate of Bezeq which provides satellite technology based multichannel television services under the “YES” brand. In exchange, the State of Israel agreed to waive all of its claims
and rights concerning cable infrastructure, such that our predecessor companies would hold all rights and title to
the cable infrastructure in their respective concession areas and have the right to operate the cable network even
after the end of the concession periods. The agreement, which was transferred to the Group as part of the Israeli
cable consolidation process, sets out a payment mechanism based on revenues deriving from the use of the cable
infrastructure pursuant to which we were required to make annual payments to the State of Israel until January 1,
2015. As of 2015, we are no longer obligated to pay such annual payments. However, we are required to pay
certain amounts to the State of Israel, as provided in the agreement, in the event we sell any of our cable network
assets or operations carried out via the cable infrastructure or in the event we issue securities through a public
offering, investment or similar transaction.

_Agreements with Bezeq relating to installation and maintenance of portions of our cable network_

In the 1990s, certain of our predecessor companies entered into agreements with Bezeq for the purpose of planning,
installing and maintaining the cable networks pursuant to which they intended to provide cable television services.
The cable networks and the related agreements with Bezeq were transferred to the Group as part of the Israeli
cable consolidation process. The agreements are valid until we have valid broadcasting licenses.

Under the terms of the agreements, Bezeq is required to maintain the portion of our cable network that passes
through its ducts on an on-going basis and is also responsible for repairing breakdowns in the network. The scope
of the agreements extends to the possibility of expanding the cable network to additional sites, connecting new
homes and connecting new neighborhoods. Bezeq is permitted to terminate the agreements if we breach the
agreements and have not cured such breach within six months of written notice from Bezeq. The agreements set


-----

forth a payment mechanism pursuant to which we pay Bezeq an annual amount representing capital expenditure
and maintenance costs based on the length of the cable network passing through its ducts as well as one-time
payments in respect of certain services provided by Bezeq. Capital expenditure costs are staggered over a 12-year
period and the amounts payable to Bezeq are accordingly reduced by approximately 65% after 12 years of the
delivery of each segment of the cable network. In July 2020, we entered into a new agreement with Bezeq,
replacing the previous agreement. According to the new agreement, HOT will continue to use Bezeq’s
infrastructure but the maintenance of the network in such areas as well as the establishment of new network
segments will be carried by HOT. We incurred total costs of NIS 50 million, NIS 51 million and NIS 49 million
for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively, for services provided by Bezeq under these
agreements.

_Agreement with IBC Israel_

On September 15, 2020, HOT announced the acquisition of a stake in IBC Israel. The transaction closed on
February 11, 2021 following regulatory and third-party approvals. Following the closing of the acquisition, HOT
became an equal partner in the IBC Partnership, an entity that holds 70% of IBC Israel’s share capital, together
with Cellcom and Israel Infrastructure Fund. HOT indirectly holds 23.3% of IBC Israel’s share capital, through
an investment of €45 million, substantially equal to the investment made by each of Cellcom and Israel
Infrastructure Fund. IEC, Israel’s Electricity Corporation, holds 30% shares of IBC Israel. As an integral part of
the investment transaction, HOT entered into an agreement for the purchase of indefeasible rights of use (IRU) in
infrastructure lines in IBC Israel, according to certain committed percentage increasing gradually, of the customers
houses connected to IBC Israel’s network. In addition, the parties signed an agreement for the provision of fiber
optic deployment services, maintenance and other technical services by a corporation held by HOT to IBC Israel.

_Agreement with Nokia Solutions and Networks relating to installation of the UMTS/LTE network_

In June 2011, we entered into an agreement with Nokia Solutions and Networks (“NSN”) for the establishment
of the new UMTS network infrastructure pursuant to which we provide 3G mobile services to our customers.
Under the terms of the agreement, NSN has agreed to plan and erect the new network infrastructure on a turnkey
basis. NSN has also agreed to provide maintenance with respect to our mobile network.

In the first stage, completed in 2012, NSN satisfied its requirement to complete the network with coverage
extending to 20% of the Israeli population according to our mobile license requirements. During 2013 and 2014,
several amendments were made to the agreement with NSN postponing payments due under the agreement in
return for an obligation which was issued in favor of NSN and guaranteed by HOT. In this framework of
agreements HOT Mobile also confirmed receipt of a final instalment of key parts in relation to the aforementioned
project.

In July 2014, an agreement was signed between HOT Mobile and NSN for the provision of equipment, hardware
and software. In addition, HOT Mobile acquired the construction and integration services of the LTE core network
for purposes of providing domestic roaming services and for adapting its network pursuant to the requirements of
the Network Sharing Agreement with Partner. In July 2016, an amendment was made to the agreement regarding
purchase of additional equipment and software as well as maintenance services for the core of the network for the
years 2016 and 2017. In December 2019 and August 2020, HOT Mobile signed an extension to the Nokia
agreement, for the year 2019 and 2020, respectively, and is currently negotiating with NSN for an extension for
2021.

_Mobile Network Sharing Agreement with Partner in Israel_

On November 8, 2013, HOT Mobile entered into a network sharing agreement (the “Network Sharing
**Agreement”) with Partner pursuant to which HOT Mobile and Partner own equal shares of PHI, a newly formed**
limited partnership, that holds, develops and operates an advanced shared mobile network for both companies.
Each party is required to maintain and operate its own core network and independently provide mobile
communication services, including marketing and sales of such services, to its respective customer base.

On April 20, 2015, the Israeli Antitrust Authority and the Israeli Ministry of Communications provided regulatory
approval for the Network Sharing Agreement subject to certain conditions including, among others, the prevention
of the transmission of business information and technology (which does not require joint activity), and conditions
relating to the management of PHI. The decision further stipulated that each party shall be entitled at all times,
and at its sole discretion, to call a third party for provision of mobile communication services which are used in


-----

the core network of such party, and that PHI will not be a party to the agreement and shall not be entitled to
payments made thereunder. However, from May 22, 2021 the Commissioner may revoke such regulatory approval
if the Commissioner finds the partnership, its existence or its actions harm competition. As of the date hereof,
such regulatory approval is still in place.

On August 9, 2015, PHI received its license to render Radio Cellular Infrastructure services for a period of 10
years.

The Network Sharing Agreement, among other things, regulates the management and development of the shared
network and the management and governance of PHI (including a mechanism for appointing directors, the
approval of business plans and certain decisions that require the approval of both parties). As consideration, HOT
Mobile was required to pay Partner an initial amount and, thereafter, each party bears half of the capital
expenditures required to establish and upgrade the shared network. The shared network operational expenditures
are allocated in accordance with a prescribed mechanism based on, inter alia, the traffic volume usage of each
party. HOT has provided a guarantee with respect to HOT Mobile’s obligations under the Network Sharing
Agreement and the Group may be required to provide an additional guarantee or a bank guarantee to Partner in
the event that the Group’s corporate rating is downgraded below a specified level.

The Network Sharing Agreement with Partner is valid until December 31, 2028 and provides for automatic
renewals in five-year increments after December 31, 2028. However, at any time after the eighth anniversary of
the effective date of the Network Sharing Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement by providing 24
months’ prior notice. The Network Sharing Agreement may also be terminated by a non-defaulting party upon
certain specified events, including a material breach, failure of a party to meet its funding obligations, termination
of a party’s license by the Israeli Ministry of Communications and the occurrence of certain insolvency events.
The Network Sharing Agreement also provides for an exit plan upon termination. In January 2019, HOT Mobile
and Partner signed an amendment to the Network Sharing Agreement with respect to the governance of PHI,
effective on January 1, 2019. Following this amendment, the parties have joint control over PHI (compared to
significant influence before the amendment); accordingly, PHI is accounted under the provisions of IFRS 11 (Joint
_Arrangements) as joint operation (recognition of HOT Mobile’s interests in PHI’s assets, liabilities, revenues and_
expenses) instead of equity method.

**_Dominican Republic_**

_Agreement to Dispose of Dominican Tower Assets_

On July 30, 2018, Altice Dominicana entered into an agreement with Phoenix Tower International, a portfolio
company of Blackstone, for the sale of 100% of the shares of Teletorres del Caribe, comprising 1,039 sites then
operated by Altice Dominicana (the “Dominican Towers Transaction”). The transaction valued Teletorres del
Caribe at an enterprise value of $170 million. The closing of the Dominican Towers Transaction was announced
on October 3, 2018. The consideration received was $168 million.

In connection with the Dominican Towers Transaction, Altice Dominicana and Teletorres del Caribe also entered
into a 20-year master agreement relating to the continued deployment of Altice Dominicana’s mobile network,
pursuant to which Altice Dominicana had committed to building 450 build-to-suit sites by 2021. In April 2021,
Altice Dominicana renegotiated the periods of deployment, which was extended up to 2025.

**Seasonality**

Although our businesses are not subject to significant seasonal effects, revenue from our pay TV, broadband
internet access and fixed-line telephony operations tend to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter of the year and
slightly lower in the third quarter of the year. As such, a major failure in the information systems or any part of
the production and logistics chain during the year-end period could have a significant adverse effect on revenues
due to the concentration of sales during this period. In Portugal, promotional campaigns at the time of the Easter
and Mother’s Day holidays also tend to increase our revenues in the second quarter and our revenues from our
operations tend to be lower during the third quarter when the Portuguese summer holidays occur.

**Intellectual Property**

We use a variety of trade names and trademarks in our business, including “Meo” and “M4O” in Portugal, “HOT”
in Israel, “Altice” in the Dominican Republic, “Altice Labs”, “Altice Technical Services” and “Teads” and, in


-----

each case, several associated trademarks. We own all of the trademarks we use. All of our trademarks are protected
in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We also rely on our access to the proprietary technology of Altice Labs.
We do not possess any material patents, nor do we believe that patents play a material role in our business.

We license some of the television programming content for our pay TV offering from third-party providers. We
own the copyright that subsists in the content developed or co-developed by us.

**Employees**

The Group has optimized its workforce with a view to build a more competitive and efficient organization in order
to allow it to adapt more quickly to the demands of the telecommunications market. As of December 31, 2020,
we had 14,643 full time employees compared to 12,874 full time employees as of December 31, 2019.

In connection with an ongoing transformation process of the Group in Portugal, in a severe context resulting from
the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the Group companies in Portugal have launched a voluntary employee
reduction program in March 2021. This program is aimed at employees aged 50 years or more and others that
decide to enroll in the program, subject to the company’s acceptance, to have their employment agreements
terminated and be entitled to receive a monthly fixed compensation up to the retirement age corresponding to a
percentage of their previous remuneration. The deadline for employees to enroll in the program has finished in
the second quarter of 2021, but the selection process of the employees that will be allowed to terminate their
employment agreements under this pre-retirement scheme is still ongoing. As of March 31, 2021, we have reached
agreements with approximately 750 employees and recognized a liability of €241 million in our financial
statements corresponding primarily to the present value of salaries payable up to retirement age to the employees
that agreed to terminate their employment agreements under pre-retirement schemes. Based on the information
up to date, the Group expects to record an additional liability in the second quarter of 2021 relating to
approximately 200 employees.

**_Labor Relations_**

We are subject to various labor laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate which typically govern the
length of the workday, minimum wages for employees, procedures for hiring and dismissing employees,
determination of severance pay, annual leave, sick days, advance notice of termination of employment, equal
opportunity and anti-discrimination laws and other conditions of employment. Further, we are generally required
to provide severance pay upon the retirement, death or dismissal of an employee. We are also required to make
national insurance payments on behalf of our employees to the government in each of the jurisdictions in which
we operate.

Some of our employees in certain countries in which we operate belong to organized unions and works councils.
In certain jurisdictions, our operating companies are also subject to collective bargaining agreements with trade
unions (for example, Portugal and Israel). In certain jurisdictions we have, in the past, faced several strikes by
personnel as a result of headcount optimization or changes in our workforce. Some of these strikes disrupted our
business and attracted adverse publicity.

In Israel, since July 2014, HOT recognizes the New General Histadrut of Workers as an organization representing
the workers of HOT and HOT Telecom. On February 10, 2016, HOT signed collective agreements with the
workers union and the New General Histadrut of Workers for a three year period, pursuant to which, among other
things, the following items were agreed: (i) salary increases of up to 16% on average during the period of the
agreement, including one-time increases of up to 10% for persons having a monthly salary less than NIS 9,000
and who have been employed for more than three years with HOT; (ii) a variety of miscellaneous benefits, such
as protection against dismissal and giving preference to internal workers for promotions and appointments to
managerial positions; and (iii) support for workers and their families, such as additional salaries to finance
childcare, summer camps and health insurance. Subsequently, on October 31, 2016 a new collective agreement
was signed between HOT Mobile, the HOT Mobile workers’ committee and the New Workers’ Histadrut, as the
representative organization for HOT Mobile, the key points of which are as follows: (i) the agreement became
effective on October 31, 2016 and had a three-year term; (ii) the employees (as defined in the agreement) were
entitled to salary increases averaging up to 1.5% in the first two years of the agreement, with the salary increase
in the third year of the agreement being negotiable; and (iii) the employees were entitled to receive a variety of
benefits, including: (a) increased employee welfare budgets and signing bonuses; (b) employment security, such
as arranging for a termination protection mechanism and arranging for placement while giving preference to
internal workers; and (c) employee support, such as salary increases to finance summer schools, health insurance


-----

and an increased holiday bonus. The agreement was renewed in August 2020 for an additional term ending
December 31, 2022.

We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.

**_Employee Benefit Plans_**

Depending on the laws and practices in force in the countries in which we operate, we are subject to a variety of
employee benefits obligations. For more information regarding our employee benefit obligations, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Defined Benefit and
_Defined Contribution Pension Plans” and the Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering_
Memorandum.

In Portugal, we are liable for certain post-retirement benefits, including pension supplements, healthcare benefits
and remuneration of employees under suspension and pre-retirement agreements (which remuneration is paid on
a monthly basis until such suspended/pre-retired employees reach the statutory retirement age). Under several
defined benefit plans, PT OpCo is responsible for paying pension supplements to a group of employees. In order
to finance these pension supplement obligations, PT OpCo incorporated various funds which are supervised by
the Portuguese Insurance and Pension Funds Supervisory Authority and are not fully capitalized. Additionally,
under a defined benefit plan, PT OpCo is responsible for paying healthcare expenses to a group of employees
(covering 19,800 beneficiaries as of December 31, 2020, approximately 18% of which are still in service) and
their relatives (covering 7,075 beneficiaries as of December 31, 2020). In 2004, PT Portugal established PT
Prestações—Mandatária de Aquisições e Gestão de Bens, S.A., an autonomous fund to finance these obligations,
which is managed by a subsidiary of PT Portugal. These obligations are not subject to any legal funding
requirements and the autonomous fund is not supervised by the Portuguese Insurance and Pension Funds
Supervisory Authority.

In Israel, our employee benefit plans are normally financed by contributions to insurance companies and classified
as defined contribution plans or as defined benefit plans. We have defined contribution plans under which we pay
regular contributions and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does
not hold sufficient amounts to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior
periods. In addition, we have a defined benefit plan in respect of severance pay pursuant to the Severance Pay
Law, 5723-1963, according to which employees are entitled to receive severance pay upon dismissal or retirement.
In respect of our severance pay obligations to certain employees, we make current deposits in pension funds and
insurance companies. Plan assets comprise assets held by a long-term employee benefit fund or qualifying
insurance policies and are not available to the Group’s own creditors and cannot be returned directly to the Group.

**Properties**

We lease and own certain properties for our corporate offices, sales offices, broadcast centers, communication
rooms, customer service centers, sales stores, mobile network sites, hubs, switches and head-end sites. The
corporate offices with respect to our Portuguese operations are located in Lisbon, Portugal, our Israeli operations
in Yakum (near Tel Aviv) and our Dominican Republic operations in Santo Domingo.

In each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we own or lease a mixture of real estate assets, including “office”
sites made up of customer service centers or offices, “mixed” sites made up of both offices and technical sites,
“technical” sites and premises for the hosting of telecommunications equipment and IT servers and “commercial”
premises and sites of brick-and-mortar stores. Our principal network assets consist of cable operating plant and
equipment, including signal receiving, encoding and decoding devices, headend facilities, fiber optic transport
networks, coaxial and distribution systems and equipment at or near customers’ homes or places of business for
each of our networks. We also own datacenters in a number of countries in which we operate.

Further, in March 2021, HOT Mobile entered into an agreement with a company of the Israeli retail group FOX
(“FOX”) for the establishment of a new corporation, in which a 51% stake will be held by HOT and 49% by FOX.
The new corporation will engage in the establishment and operation of concept stores for the sale of mobile devices,
accessories and other communication and multimedia products, under a joint brand.

We believe that our properties meet our present needs and are generally well-maintained and suitable for their
intended use. We believe that we generally have sufficient space to conduct our operations but maintain flexibility
to move certain operations to alternative premises.


-----

**Environmental Matters**

We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to land use, environmental protection and health and
safety in connection with our ownership of real property and other operations, including laws regulating non-ionic
radiations emitted as a result of our mobile services. While we could incur costs, such as clean-up costs, fines and
third party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under such laws
or regulations, we believe we substantially comply with the applicable requirements of such laws and regulations
and follow standardized procedures to manage environmental risks. Given our activities and our current property,
plant and equipment, we believe that there are no environmental factors likely to have a significant impact on the
use of our current property, plant and equipment, other than as disclosed in “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our
_Business, Technology and Competition—Our business may be adversely affected by actual or perceived health_
_risks and other environmental requirements relating to exposure to electromagnetic fields through_
_telecommunications equipment”._

Furthermore, we are also careful to offer our subscribers ecologically responsible products and services in order
to reduce their energy consumption. Due to their versatility and multifunctionality, our set-top boxes represent a
significant advance in this respect, since they combine several functions (Blu-Ray TM reader, TV-HD decoder
and removable hard drive) into one device.

**Insurance**

We maintain a property insurance policy with wide coverage based on “extended fire” wording to cover our
property on a new replacement basis. In certain of our geographies, including Israel, we also maintain a business
interruption policy based upon the same perils. The property coverage is supported by coverage for electronic
equipment. We maintain various liability insurance policies including general liability, comprehensive third-party
liability, products liability and professional liability, multimedia liability and employer’s liability insurance
policies. In addition to these policies we maintain motor vehicle insurance policies, a heavy equipment policy, an
open policy for contract works to cover maintenance and development works. We do not insure against certain
operational risks for which insurance is unavailable or which can only be insured at what we believe to be on
unreasonable terms.

In our view, the sum insured, the limits of liability, the deductibles and scope of cover in our policies are
satisfactory and suitable for companies acting in the telecommunications sector (subject to the wording of the
policies, conditions and exclusions). However, we cannot guarantee that no losses will be incurred or that no
claims will be filed against us which go beyond the type and scope of the existing insurance coverage. With respect
to the majority of our businesses, we do not insure against war and terrorism risks, but we believe we are covered
in Israel by the Property Tax and Compensation Fund Law 1961.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are involved in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business.
The legal proceedings initiated against us include, amongst others, the following categories of claims: claims by
or on behalf of customers on various grounds such as alleged misrepresentation or breach of service or license
terms or breach of telecommunication, broadcasting, consumer or health and safety regulations, intellectual
property claims primarily relating to alleged copyright infringement brought by copyright collection societies,
claims by suppliers and other telecommunications providers, claims by employees and claims by the regulatory
bodies whose jurisdiction we are subject to in the countries in which we operate. In Israel, a majority of legal
proceedings against us are suits seeking certification as class action suits. The Israeli Class Action Law that was
enacted in 2006 significantly expanded the grounds for certification of class action suits as well as the persons
entitled to submit a class action suit as a result of which the number of such proceedings against us has increased
significantly and may continue to increase in the future.

We proactively manage our litigation risks by assessing disputes where we believe the claimant may have merit
and attempting to settle such disputes on favorable terms, including in the case of suits seeking certification as
class action suits at a stage prior to such certification, and contesting others where we believe the claim does not
have merit. We record a provision when there is a sufficient probability that a dispute will result in a loss for the
Group and the amount of such a loss can be reasonably estimated. Other than as discussed below, as of the date
hereof, we are not aware of any administrative, judicial or arbitral proceedings (including any pending or
threatened proceedings) that are likely to have, or have had, over the course of the last twelve months a material


-----

adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The outcome of legal proceedings, however, can
be extremely difficult to predict with certainty, and we can offer no assurances in this regard.

We have recorded provisions for claims, legal actions and tax contingencies in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican
Republic amounting to €101 million, €44 million and €5 million, respectively, in each case as of March 31, 2021,
to cover the Group’s probable future cash outflows relating to such matters. Those amounts are recorded in the
Statement of Financial Position under the lines ‘Provisions - current and non-current’, ‘Current tax liabilities’ and
‘Deferred tax liabilities’ in the Unaudited Financial Statements.

**_Portugal_**

The PT Portugal Group is subject to several claims, legal actions and tax contingencies for which the risk of loss
is considered probable. Significant litigation involving the PT Portugal Group is further described below.

_Tax proceedings_

We estimate that the cumulative balance of probable tax contingencies arising from tax audits conducted by
Portuguese tax authorities on various companies within the PT Portugal Group amount to €58 million as of March
31, 2021.

The provision covers risks related mainly to the deductibility of capital losses on the disposal of financial
investments and VAT on indemnities charged as result of the breach of loyalty contracts, entered into with postpaid customers. The VAT contingency relates to both the fixed and mobile businesses and covers years since 2012.
The assessment for the VAT of the mobile business in 2012 has been submitted to an arbitral tribunal, which
decided to refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the EU (“CJEU”) for a preliminary ruling. On November 22,
2018, the CJEU issued a decision which was unfavorable to PT OpCo, concluding that, under certain
circumstances, indemnities should be charged with VAT, and at the same time concluding that ultimately VAT
should only be assessed based on indemnities received from customers. The tax assessments of the fixed-line
business in 2012 and both the mobile and fixed-line businesses in 2013 and 2014, were submitted to the arbitral
tribunal as well, and all proceedings were suspended pending the decision of the CJEU. Following the CJEU’s
decision, PT OpCo was notified of the arbitral tribunal’s decisions, all unfavorable, although concluding that VAT
should only be assessed based on indemnities received from customers, which is less than 20% of the overall
indemnities invoiced. For all the processes against the arbitral court decisions PT OpCo presented appeals to the
TCA (Central Administrative Court). For the year 2015, the contingency was annulled following the voluntary
tax payment made by PT OpCo under that year’s tax inspection. A similar approach was followed in relation to
the years 2016, 2017 and 2018. For the following years it is not certain that tax authorities will accept a similar
adjustment.

In addition, we have received certain tax assessments from the tax authorities questioning the deductibility of
certain interest expenses incurred between 2005 and 2010 for income tax purposes (€236 million as of March 31,
2021). We strongly disagree with these assessments and believe, based on the opinion of our tax advisors, that
there are solid arguments to oppose the position of the tax authorities. We do not consider the losses related to
these tax contingencies to be probable.

Further, PT OpCo has received a preliminary tax inspection report for the year 2018 in which the tax authorities
are proposed a stamp tax correction of €29 million relating to the Portuguese Towers Transaction. PT OpCo
submitted its preliminary defense on May 24, 2021, but the tax authorities maintained their position in their final
tax inspection report. MEO is now required to pay or present a guarantee by the end of August 2021 and it has
until the end of the year to present an administrative claim. PT OpCo intends to counter the possible correction.
As of March 31, 2021, the amount of provision recorded in the Unaudited Financial Statements in relation to this
tax inspection is €0 (nil).

_Regulatory and Civil Proceedings_

_Optimus—Interconnection agreement_

In 2001, Optimus—Comunicações S.A. (now “NOS”) brought an action against Telecomunicações Móveis
Nacionais (“TMN”) relating to prices charged by TMN to NOS for mobile interconnection services. TMN
transferred the receivables from NOS to PTC (PT Portugal’s fixed operation at the time, now PT OpCo) and
subsequently PT OpCo offset those receivables with payables due to NOS. NOS argued for the annulment of the


-----

offset amount and claimed the amount of payables originally due to NOS plus accrued interest. In August 2015,
the court decided that the transfer of the interconnection receivables from TMN to PT OpCo, and consequently
the offset of such receivables, was invalid. The court therefore ruled against PT OpCo, ordering the payment of
approximately €35 million in payables and interest. PT OpCo appealed to the Court of Appeal in October 2015.
In September 2016, PT OpCo was notified of the decision from the Court of Appeal which confirmed the initial
ruling against PT OpCo, as a result of which PT OpCo decided to appeal to the Supreme Court. On March 13,
2017, PT OpCo was notified of the Supreme Court’s decision of dismissal of its appeal, following which it
appealed to the Constitutional Court. On January 8, 2018, the Constitutional Court notified PT OpCo that it had
dismissed the appeal. PT OpCo subsequently appealed to the Constitutional Court Conference which decided not
to accept the appeal. In July 2018, PT OpCo paid €41 million to NOS as a result of these proceedings. NOS
claimed an additional amount of interest during the judicial procedure and is now claiming an additional payment
of €5 million. The legal action by PT OpCo was submitted in February 2019. On May 8, 2020, PT OpCo received
the first instance sentence that absolves PT OpCo of the request by NOS. NOS appealed to the higher court that,
on January 15, 2021, ordered PT OpCo to pay the total amount requested by NOS. PT OpCo appealed to the
Supreme Court in February 2021.

_ANACOM litigation_

PT OpCo is subject to several outstanding proceedings filed by ANACOM, although PT OpCo has not yet
received formal notifications for some of these proceedings. The proceedings include matters such as the violation
of rules relating to portability, DTT, the non-compliance of obligations under the universal service obligations
(fixed voice and public phones) and restricting the access to phone numbers starting at 760. Historically, PT OpCo
paid amounts significantly lower than the administrative fines set by ANACOM in final decisions. The initial
value of the proceedings is normally set at the maximum applicable amount of the administrative fine until the
final decision is formally issued.

We are regularly involved in regulatory inquiries and investigations involving our operations, including by
ANACOM, regarding our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_Legislative and Regulatory Matters—We are subject to significant government regulation and supervision, which_
_could require us to make additional expenditures or limit our revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business,_
_and further regulatory changes could also adversely affect our business” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to_
_Legislative and Regulatory Matters—We can only operate our business for as long as we have licenses from the_
_relevant authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and we may not be able to obtain, retain or review_
_the licenses and authorizations necessary for conducting our activities”._

As of March 31, 2021, we had ongoing administrative proceedings initiated by ANACOM in an aggregate amount
of approximately €37 million (though the maximum possible fine for an individual proceeding is capped at €5
million). We believe that most of the complaints that have resulted in such investigations should be dismissed due
to the nature of the alleged abuses. However, if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations
in these or other regulatory inquiries and investigations, we could become subject to penalties, fines, damages or
other sanctions.

_Zon TV Cabo Portugal—Violation of portability rules_

In 2011, NOS (known as Zon TV Cabo Portugal at the time of the proceeding) initiated legal proceedings against
PT OpCo, claiming that the latter had not complied with the rules applicable to the portability of fixed numbers.
NOS is seeking €22 million in damages corresponding to profits allegedly lost due to unreasonable rejections by
PT OpCo and the delay in providing the portability of numbers. An expert appointed by each party as well as a
third party expert evaluated this matter and presented a final report to the court in January 2019 and the final court
hearing is scheduled for October 2021.

_Municipal taxes and rights-of-way_

Pursuant to a statute enacted on August 1, 1997, as an operator of a basic telecommunications network, we were
exempt from municipal taxes and rights-of-way and other fees with respect to our network in connection with our
obligations under the concession. The Portuguese government has advised us in the past that this statute confirmed
the tax exemption under our concession and that it will continue to take the necessary actions in order for us to
maintain the economic benefits contemplated by the concession.


-----

Law 5/2004, dated February 10, 2004, established a new rights-of-way regime in Portugal whereby each
municipality may establish a fee, up to a maximum of 0.25% of each wireline services bill, to be paid by the
customers of those wireline operators whose network infrastructures are located in each such municipality.
Meanwhile, Decree-Law 123/2009, dated May 21, 2009, clarified that no other tax should be levied by the
municipalities in addition to the tax established by Law 5/2004. This interpretation was confirmed by the Supreme
Administrative Court of Portugal in several legal actions.

Some municipalities, however, continue to hold the position that Law 5/2004 does not expressly revoke other
taxes that the municipalities wish to establish because Law 5/2004 is not applicable to public municipalities.
Currently, there are legal actions with some municipalities regarding this matter and some of the municipalities
have initiated enforcement proceedings against us to demand the payment of those taxes.

_Vodafone Portugal—Network Sharing Agreement_

In 2014, Vodafone Portugal and PTC (now PT OpCo) signed an agreement for the acquisition of exclusive rights
of use of the PON network. The agreement contained the possibility of access to the installed infrastructure owned
by each of the parties to offer new generation services and integrated offerings of voice, internet and television
services autonomously in the retail market. In 2015, PT OpCo informed Vodafone Portugal that it has decided to
individually develop a new plan for the expansion of its fiber optic network, both in geographical areas already
covered by a new generation network and in other geographical areas, while continuing to comply with their
agreement. Vodafone Portugal nonetheless states that this was a breach of the agreement and submitted a claim
for damages of approximately €132 million to an arbitral tribunal. In June 2018, PT OpCo filed a defense to the
claim in which it opposed Vodafone Portugal’s submissions. A preliminary hearing took place in February 2019,
following which the court asked experts to review information provided by Vodafone Portugal supporting its
alleged damages and losses. The experts’ reports have been submitted to the court and the deadline for both parties
to comment was the end of October 2020. PT OpCo and Vodafone responded to the experts analysis, asking for
clarification on some of the elements of the expertise, and the court gave the experts a period of time until the end
of March 2021 to respond. The experts’ reports have been submitted to the court and the judgment sessions are
scheduled to start in October 2021.

_European Commission investigation into PT Portugal Acquisition_

After having approved the PT Portugal Acquisition on April 20, 2015, the EC initiated an investigation into
infringement by Altice Europe of the obligation of prior notification of concentrations under Article 4(1) of the
Merger Regulation and/or of the stand-still obligation laid down in Article 7(1) of the Merger Regulation. The EC
issued a statement of objections on May 18, 2017 alleging that Altice Europe breached the Merger Regulation by
implementing the PT Portugal Acquisition before notification or approval by the EC as required under applicable
law. On August 18, 2017, Altice Europe submitted a full response to the statement of objections in which it
contested all of the objections and requested that a hearing take place. A hearing took place in Brussels on
September 21, 2017. On April 24, 2018, the EC notified the Altice Europe Group of its decision to impose upon
it a fine of €125 million on the basis of a finding that the Altice Europe Group infringed the prior notification
obligation of a concentration under Article 4(1) of the EU Merger Regulation as well as the stand-still obligation
under Article 7(1) of the Merger Regulation. The Altice Europe Group disputes the EC’s decision and on July 5,
2018, the Altice Europe Group filed an appeal against the decision before the GCEU seeking annulment of the
decision or, at the very least, a significant reduction in the fine imposed. On July 25, 2018, we issued a bank
guarantee to the EC in relation to the fine for an amount of €125 million. The appeal proceedings before the GCEU
are currently ongoing and certain details relating to the status of the matter are set out below.

On November 6, 2018, the Council of the EU filed an application to intervene in the case. On November 30, 2018,
the EC lodged a defense, to which Altice Europe replied on February 25, 2019, in line with the submissions set
forth in its appeal. On March 15, 2019, Altice Europe filed its observations on the Statement of intervention of
the Council of European Union, to which Altice Europe received the EC’s observations on March 18, 2019. The
EU filed its rejoinder to Altice Europe’s reply on May 10, 2019. Altice Europe submitted a reasoned request for
a hearing on May 29, 2019. On March 10, 2020, Altice Europe received from the General Court an invitation
addressed to all the parties to submit observations regarding the possible consequences of the CJEU judgment on
another case. On March 25, 2020, Altice Europe lodged its observations and reiterated its submission filed on
May 29, 2019. On March 23, 2020, the EC and the Council of the EU lodged their observations, wherein they
concluded that Altice Europe’s application should be rejected. On June 3, 2020, Altice Europe received the
decision from the General Court to open the oral part of the procedure. On July 21, 2020, Altice Europe received
the report for the hearing prepared by the Judge Rapporteur summarizing the facts relied on and the arguments of


-----

each party and of the Council as the intervener. The hearing took place on September 24, 2020 and on October 5,
2020, Altice Europe sent a letter to the General Court with some observations to respond to a question posed by
the Judge Rapporteur during the hearing. On November 16, 2020, Altice Europe received the decision from the
General Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure, to hear the other parties on Altice Europe’s observations
and to request the EC to produce certain documents. On December 10, 2020, Altice Europe received a copy of the
EC’s and the Council’s responses. On January 7, 2021, Altice Europe sent its observations to the EC’s reply. On
January 12, 2021, Altice Europe received the decision from the General Court to close the oral part of the
procedure. The judgement on the matter is scheduled for September 22, 2021.

As of March 31, 2021, a liability of €130 million (including accrued interest) is recorded at Altice Portugal, as it
is the acquiring entity of PT Portugal. These proceedings do not affect the approval granted by the EC for the PT
Portugal Acquisition.

_Potential claims_

PTC is subject to a potential compensation claim brought by Estradas de Portugal relating to PTC’s use of a
technical road channel between 2007 and 2014. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, no formal legal
proceedings have been initiated with regards to these claims.

_National Commission for Data Protection_

PT OpCo has several outstanding proceedings filed by the National Commission for Data Protection (“CNPD”),
for some of which PT OpCo has not yet received formal condemnations. This includes matters such as the
violation of rules relating to marketing contact with clients and alleged non-compliance of obligations under the
database of debtors to telecom operators.

Historically, PT OpCo paid significantly lower (or even no amounts) of the administrative fines set by CNPD in
final decisions. The initial value of the proceedings is normally set at the maximum applicable amount of the
administrative fine until the final decision is formally issued. The existing processes are still in progress and the
new ones are being prepared for the defense phase.

_Portuguese Competition Authority investigation_

On December 20, 2019, PT OpCo received a Statement of Objections from the Portuguese Competition Authority
regarding its preliminary view that both PT OpCo and NOWO, which operates as an MVNO using PT OpCo’s
network, were part of a cartel for market sharing and price fixing of mobile services, sold either on a standalone
basis or in bundles of fixed and mobile telecommunications services. The Portuguese Competition Authority
concluded that this alleged illegal practice took place between 2017 and 2018. PT OpCo firmly denies the
existence of any cartel.

On February 19, 2020, PT OpCo submitted its written defense to the Statement of Objections. On December 3,
2020, the Portuguese Competition Authority notified PT OpCo of its decision to impose a fine of €84 million for
market sharing and price fixing of mobile and fixed telecommunications services with NOWO. On January 18,
2021, PT OpCo filed a judicial appeal against the decision before the Competition, Supervision and Regulation
Court to request the decision to be annulled and to be acquitted of all charges. As of March 31, 2021, the provision
recorded in relation to this matter in our financial statements is €0 (nil).

_Portuguese Competition Authority investigation – Google AdWords_

On July 17, 2020, the Portuguese Competition Authority issued a Statement of Objections regarding its
preliminary view that PT OpCo, NOS Comunicações, NOWO – Communications, S.A. and Vodafone Portugal –
Comunicações Pessoas, S.A. were part of an agreement in accordance with which these entities would not bid for
certain key Google AdWords of the other operators, which in accordance with the Portuguese Competition
Authority is similar to an agreement to indirectly fix the acquisition price of certain Google AdWords related to
the retail telecommunications market. The Portuguese Competition Authority concluded that telecommunications
operators distorted competition of the Portuguese online search advertising, between 2010 and 2018 in the case
of PT OpCo. The maximum fine applicable for this kind of infraction corresponds to 10% of the entity’s turnover.


-----

PT OpCo submitted its written defense to the Statement of Objections on October 2, 2020 and is still awaiting a
decision. Management determined that it cannot estimate the probability of the outcome of this case and as such
no provision was recognized as of March 31, 2021.

**_Israel_**

_Certain class action suits in Israel_

From time to time, HOT and its subsidiaries are involved in class action litigation relating to claims arising out of
its operations in the ordinary course of business. As of the date hereof, certain of the material pending class action
suits filed against HOT and its subsidiaries include: (i) a suit for alleged breaches of certain subscribers’
agreements and misleading subscribers when increasing prices of services, (ii) a suit alleging discrimination by
HOT between customers in relation to subscription fees, (iii) a suit alleging that HOT has not upheld its obligations
to (a) establish, maintain and operate a public, nation-wide telecommunication network and (b) use the network
to provide telecommunications services and multi-channel television services to public subscribers throughout the
country, specifically in Arab communities, (iv) a suit alleging broadcasting of commercials on sports channels in
violation of the relevant regulation, (v) a suit alleging violation by HOT and HOT Telecom of regulatory
obligations regarding response time in call centers, (vi) a suit regarding sales of channels, (vii) a suit regarding
electricity charges for amplifiers in apartment buildings, (ix) a suit regarding invoicing of modems; (viii) a suit
regarding delays in disconnecting subscribers and (ix) a suit regarding the allegedly unlawful extension of
customer contracts. As of March 31, 2021, a provision of NIS 59 million is recorded at HOT in relation to the
pending class action suits.

Historically, such class action litigation brought against us has either been dismissed or settled for an amount
significant lower than the damages claimed. We do not believe any of these matters individually, or in the
aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operation.

_Tax proceedings_

On July 4, 2019, HOT signed a compromise agreement with the Israeli Tax Authorities for an amount of €8
million (NIS 31 million) related to tax assessment for periods 2015-2016. As of March 31, 2021, there were
several tax contingencies against Cool Holding and HOT for which the risk of loss is considered probable. For
these contingencies, we recorded provisions amounting to €29 million (NIS 115 million) as of March 31, 2021.

_VAT proceedings_

On April 29, 2021, in relation to the VAT audit conducted by the Israeli VAT Authority for the tax years 20132019, Cool Holding and Hadaros received a VAT reassessment notice for a total amount of €151 million. The
VAT assessment is related to accrued interest on intercompany bonds issued by Cool Holding and Hadaros. Cool
Holding and Hadaros intend to dispute the reassessments and has been provided with an extension for filing a tax
appeal until October 3, 2021. As of March 31, 2021, no provision has been recorded in the Unaudited Financial
Statements in relation to these VAT reassessments.

**REGULATION**

**General**

Our business is subject to various regulatory requirements and obligations including communications and
broadcasting laws, general antitrust law, environmental, health and safety laws, planning and construction laws,
consumer protection laws as well as technical and other regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Such laws and regulations are promulgated and enforced to varying degrees by supranational regulators such as
the EC and national, state, regional and local authorities. The ever-changing regulatory environment can have a
material effect on our activities. Certain key provisions of the regulations governing our activities in Israel,
Portugal, Luxembourg and the Dominican Republic as of the date of this Offering Memorandum are set forth
below. This description is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all regulation in this area nor a review
of specific obligations which have been imposed on us.

**Portugal**

**_Liberalization of the Portuguese telecommunications market_**

The first Portuguese telecommunications regulatory framework was enacted in 1989 under Law 88/89 of
September 11, 1989, to regulate the opening of the telecommunications network to private enterprises. This initial
regulatory package divided the industry into two main areas: (i) a state owned and monopolistic basic
telecommunications network and services, which meant the fixed national telephony services and some associated
facilities, run by the publicly owned companies that in 1995 merged to form the PT Group; and (ii) the so called
complementary services which assembled a large group of mainly private operators ranging from mobile wireless
operators (using GSM), paging, trunking, VSAT and data transmission (using mainly Frame Relay and X25
protocols).

Following the 1996 revision of the EU’s ONP Directives (e.g. Directives 96/2/EC, 96/19/EC and 97/13/EC), in
August 1997, the Portuguese government decided to revise the whole regulatory structure and submitted to
Parliament a new Telecommunications Bill aimed at establishing “the general bases that regulate the establishment,
management and operation of telecommunications networks and the provision of telecommunications services”
later enacted as Law 91/97 of August 28, 1997. The adoption of a “full liberalization” principle accelerated the
progressive opening of the Portuguese telecommunications market to new entrants, and was completed on
January 1, 2000, with the end of Portugal Telecom’s legal monopoly over fixed-telephony services.

**_Legal framework_**

Following the major review of existing EU telecommunications law that resulted in the adoption of a new
regulatory framework for electronic communications in 2002, known as the “Review 99” Directives, the
Portuguese Parliament enacted Law 5/2004 of February 10, 2004 (the “2004 Communications Law”). The new
legislation transposed the EU Review 99 package Directives and regulations to national law and revoked all
previous regulations containing provisions related to general market framework, licensing, interconnection and
all telecommunications networks and service provision, with the exception of radio communications,
telecommunications infrastructure and supply of electronic equipment.

In 2011, Law 51/2011 of September 13, 2011, amended the 2004 Communications Law, transposing other EU
Directives into national law. The 2004 Communications Law was further amended several other times, including
(among other statutory instruments) by Law 10/2013, of January 28, 2013, and Law 15/2016, of June 17, 2016,
which introduced additional consumer protection rules. The last amendment occurred in 2020 with the enactment
of Decree-Law 49/2020, of August 4, 2020. Although some provisions of the 2004 Communications Law already
dealt with data privacy issues, the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC) was
transposed by Law 41/2004 of August 18, 2004, which was further amended by Law 46/2012, of August 29, 2012.

**_Regulatory Institutions_**

        - _European Commission. The Directorate General for Competition of the EC, is responsible for_
assessing, investigating and sanctioning potential conducts in breach of the key provisions of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”) relating to competition in the
EU (in result of third party complaints, _ex officio investigations or, if applicable, leniency_
requests). Among other things, the TFEU prohibits (i) agreements or coordinated action


-----

between competitors that may affect trade between the EU Member States and have as their
objective or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the EU and
(ii) any abuse of dominant position in certain markets within the EU that may affect trade
between the EU Member States. The Directorate General for Competition enforces these rules
in cooperation with national competition authorities. In addition, national courts have
jurisdiction over violations of EU competition law. The Directorate General for
Communications Networks, Content & Technology (DG Connect) of the EC is responsible for,
among others, coordinating the regulatory framework for competition and growth over the entire
range of issues in the telecommunications field: economic analysis, impact assessment, policy
development and regulatory compliance. The EC can impose the termination of certain conducts,
impose structural measures, if applicable, as well as impose fines not exceeding 10% of the
turnover, in the last financial year, of the undertaking in breach.

- On December 20, 2018, Directive 2018/1972, of the European Parliament and of the Council,
of December 11, 2018 formally adopted the European Electronic Communications Code
(“EECC”). The EECC is expected to have an impact over both the activities of
telecommunications networks and services providers as well as the national regulators in the
EU Member States. Pursuant to Article 33 of EECC, the EC shall be afforded with certain veto
powers over the decisions of national regulators, such as ANACOM, regarding imposition of
remedies to operators found to have significant market power. Portugal had until December
2020 to transpose the EECC to domestic legislation.

- _ANACOM. ANACOM (The Autoridade Nacional de Comunicações), the Portuguese_
telecommunications regulator advises the Portuguese government on telecommunications
policy and legislation and monitors compliance with concessions, licenses and permits granted
to telecommunications networks and services providers in Portugal. The Portuguese
government has substantially increased the autonomy of ANACOM and has allowed it to
become a more effective and independent regulatory body. ANACOM acts on complaints
against us by our competitors, our customers and other interested parties. It can impose fines on
us if we do not meet our obligations under the law or its determinations. ANACOM’s decisions
are subject to judicial review. The current version of the bylaws of ANACOM was approved by
Decree Law 39/2015 of March 16, 2015.

- _Portuguese Competition Authority. Our activities are also overseen by the Portuguese_
Competition Authority (Autoridade da Concorrência), which is responsible for the public
enforcement of competition law in Portugal, derived from ex officio investigations, complaints
by third parties and, when applicable, leniency requests. The relevant Portuguese provisions,
Articles 9 and 11 of the Portuguese Competition Act, Law 19/2012, of May 8, mirror,
respectively, Articles 101 and 102 of TFEU. The Portuguese Competition Authority is also
competent to assess potential breaches of the TFEU’s competition rules. The Portuguese
Competition Authority can impose the termination of certain conducts, impose structural
measures, if applicable, as well as impose fines not exceeding 10% of the turnover, in the last
financial year, of the undertaking in breach. Under Portuguese law, we are permitted to appeal
any adverse decision of the Portuguese Competition Authority. The Portuguese Competition
Authority’s decisions are subject to judicial review by the Competition Court, which also has
jurisdiction over private enforcement action brought by private parties harmed by a potential
competition law infringement.

- _ERC. The Entidade Reguladora para a Comunicação Social (the “ERC”), is the independent_
regulatory authority for the Portuguese media. ERC’s primary responsibilities are the regulation
and supervision of all entities that undertake media activities in Portugal. The ERC is a legal
entity endowed with administrative and financial autonomy. The ERC oversees compliance
with respect to fundamental rights such as freedom of the press, right to information,
independence from political and economic power and freedom of speech. It is also responsible
for monitoring compliance by all companies operating in the media sector, with standards for
media and broadcast content, as well as for promoting the proper and effective functioning of
the market where such companies operate. The ERC’s decisions may affect, among others, news
agencies, periodicals, radio or television operators, and radio and television distribution
operators.


-----

        - _CNPD—Comissão Nacional de Proteção de Dados. The Comissão Nacional de Proteção de_
Dados is the Portuguese Data Protection Authority. It is an independent body, with powers of
authority throughout the Portuguese national territory. It is endowed with the power to supervise
and monitor compliance with the laws and regulations in the area of personal data protection.

**_EU Regulatory Framework and Relevant Markets_**

The EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services consists of five directives
governing procedures, authorizations, access, universal service and data protection; a recommendation on relevant
product and service markets within the electronic communications sector subject to “ex ante” regulation under a
common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services; and two regulations, one
concerning the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC), the other concerning the
so-called “TSM—Telecom Single Market” (which encompasses roaming on public mobile communications
networks, net neutrality and international calls and SMS in the EU). EU directives, regulations and
recommendations, which adopt competition law principles such as market dominance for the designation of
significant market power and the definitions of relevant product and geographic markets, which may be subject
to “ex ante” regulation, have involved constant changes and refinements to this framework. The framework
focuses on issues such as reinforcing consumer rights, encouraging competitive conditions among operators to
increase consumer choice, promoting investment in new communications infrastructure (such as by freeing
spectrum for the provision of broadband services) and ensuring network security and integrity.

Directive (EU) 2018/1972, of the European Parliament and of the Council approved the EECC. The deadline for
the transposition of this directive into national law was December 21, 2020. Directives 2002/19/EC, 2002/20/EC,
2002/21/EC and 2002/22/EC (part of the current EU regulatory framework for electronic communications
networks and services) were repealed with effect as of December 21, 2020. As of the date hereof, Portugal has
not yet transposed Directive (EU) 2018/1972 into national law.

Under the current regulatory framework, national regulators may impose ex-ante obligations on operators found
to have significant market power in any of the five wholesale markets identified by the EC.

When considering that any of the abovementioned markets is not susceptible to ex-ante regulation in the specific
national circumstances, national regulatory authorities should demonstrate, and the EC will verify, that at least
one of the following criteria is not met: (i) the presence of high and non-transitory structural, legal or regulatory
barriers to entry; (ii) a market structure which does not tend towards effective competition within the relevant time
horizon, having regard to the state of infrastructure-based and other competition behind the barriers to entry; and
(iii) competition law alone is insufficient to adequately address the identified market failure(s).

The aforementioned criteria are also relevant for the purposes of national regulatory authorities to identify markets
other than the aforementioned for the purposes of determining any ex-ante regulations. This identification is
subject to EC’s verification.

Because we are active in all of the markets identified by the EC (and ANACOM), these regulatory measures have
affected, and will affect, our businesses and operations.

Within the EU framework, ANACOM has identified, in the first round of analysis initiated in 2004, 19 retail and
wholesale markets in Portugal. In a process it is required to undergo periodically, ANACOM has found Portugal
Telecom to have significant market power in all but one of the analyzed markets, where ANACOM determined
that no operator had significant market power (wholesale transit services). These markets included: (i) retail
markets—access to the public telephone network at a fixed location (residential and business), publicly available


-----

local and/or national telephone services provided at a fixed location (residential and business), publicly available
international telephone services provided at a fixed location (residential and business), telephone services at a
fixed location using non-geographic numbers, such as toll-free numbers and leased lines; and (ii) wholesale
markets—call origination on the fixed telephone network provided at a fixed location, call termination on
individual public telephone networks provided at a fixed location and wholesale unbundled access to local metallic
loops, wholesale leased lines (trunk segments and terminating segments) and wholesale broadband access.

In its second round of analysis, ANACOM conducted a market analysis to determine the regulatory obligations
to be imposed on operators that at the time had a significant market power in the provision of wholesale (physical)
network infrastructure access and wholesale broadband access. With respect to Wholesale Markets 4 and 5 (for
the provision of wholesale (physical) network infrastructure access and wholesale broadband access), ANACOM
has segmented the broadband market geographically between “C” (competitive) areas and “NC” (non-competitive)
areas. In the “NC” areas we are obligated to provide a wholesale local loop unbundling reference offer (in relation
to Market 4) and to provide a wholesale broadband (bitstream) reference offer (in relation to Market 5). Market 5
was deregulated in “C” areas, and hence all obligations in this market, including the wholesale bitstream reference
offer, no longer apply. Nevertheless, while our obligation to provide a bitstream reference offer (Rede ADSL PT)
in “C” areas expired after a transitional period, we have decided to maintain the bitstream reference offer. See “—
_Areas of Recent Regulation and Updates—Next Generation Access Networks”._

In addition to PT OpCo, all other fixed-line operators in Portugal were determined to have significant market
power in the call termination on individual public telephone networks provided at a fixed-location wholesale
market. Likewise, all mobile network operators were found to have significant market power in the call
termination on individual mobile networks. In 2010, ANACOM found PT OpCo to have significant market power
in the wholesale leased lines terminal market and segmented the transit segments between “C” and “NC” routes.
In these wholesale markets, ANACOM included Ethernet connections and imposed a retail-minus rule over
Ethernet solutions (which was never specified). In the “C” routes, PT OpCo has no significant market power.

On August 14, 2014, ANACOM approved the final decisions regarding retail markets for fixed access and
telephony services (Market 1/2007—Access to PSTN for residential and non-residential users and Markets 3, 4,
5, and 6/2003—publicly available telephone services provided at a fixed location), which are no longer regulated
(https://www.anacom.pt/render.jsp?contentId=1311892).

On July 23, 2015, ANACOM approved an urgent and interim decision regarding the market for wholesale leased
lines, by which it reduced by 50% the wholesale price of CAM (Continent - Azores - Madeira) leased lines.

On September 1, 2016, ANACOM approved the final decision regarding the analysis of the wholesale high-quality
access at a fixed location (Market 4/2014), (https://www.anacom.pt/render.jsp?contentId=1394170):

        - For wholesale terminating segments of leased lines (including Ethernet) two sub-markets were
defined: low-bandwidth (≤ 24 Mbps) and high-bandwidth (> 24 Mbps). Trunk segments of
leased lines and international submarine cables are included.

        - ANACOM defined two geographic sub-markets (high-quality access and trunk segment of
leased lines markets): competitive areas and non-competitive areas. Each submarine cable
covers a different geographic market.

        - PT OpCo is considered to have significant market power in non-competitive areas and
submarine cables, for which it is under the following obligations: providing access; transparency,
including publication of reference offer; accounting separation; and non-discrimination. In noncompetitive areas of high-quality access, trunk segments of leased lines and submarine cables
there are price control and cost accounting obligations. In ‘almost competitive areas’ of highquality access (non-competitive areas that tend to be competitive in the future) there is a margin
squeeze test.

On March 23, 2017, ANACOM approved the final decision regarding markets for wholesale local access at a
fixed location – WLA (Market 3a/2014) and wholesale central access for mass-market products—WCA (Market
3b/2014) (https://www.anacom.pt/render.jsp?contentId=1407465).

Wholesale local access at a fixed location includes copper, fiber and cable (although there was no cable wholesale
access product actually offered in the market) and covers the entire Portuguese territory. PT OpCo is considered


-----

to have significant market power and is subject to the following obligations regarding its copper and passive
infrastructures: access to local loop unbundling (LLU); access to ducts and poles; cost orientation; nondiscrimination (EoI for duct and pole access, equivalence of output (EoO) for LLU and dark fiber); cost accounting
and accounting separation; and transparency, including publication of a reference offer. For fiber no remedies
were imposed, except for access to dark fiber when there is no duct or pole availability.

Wholesale broadband access market includes the same products and two geographic sub-markets were defined:
competitive areas and non-competitive areas. An area is considered to be competitive if: (i) there are at least two
alternative operators (ANO) as well as PT OpCo, and each ANO has more than 50% NGA coverage (NGA
meaning fiber and cable DOCSIS 3.0); or (ii) if there is one ANO with more than 50% NGA coverage, and PT
OpCo’s retail market share in the parish is below 50%. PT OpCo is considered to have significant market power
in non-competitive areas, for which it is subject to the following obligations on copper: providing access; cost
orientation (plus margin squeeze test); non-discrimination; cost accounting and accounting separation; and
transparency. No remedies were imposed on fiber.

On October 4, 2018, ANACOM approved the final decision regarding retail market for call origination on fixed
networks (Market 2/2007), which is no longer regulated (https://www.anacom.pt/render.jsp?contentId=1460547),
except for price controls which remained in force for a period of 18 months.

**_Our Concessions and Existing Licenses and Authorizations_**

_General_

The EU prohibits any limitation on the number of new entrants in telecommunications markets, except as required
to ensure efficient use of radio frequencies. Pursuant to this directive, which is part of the EU electronic
communications framework, an operator must have a general authorization for the provision of electronic
communications networks or services. A license for individual rights of use can be required for the use of radio
frequencies or numbering resources. The objective of this authorization regime is to introduce more flexibility
into the licensing framework.

Currently, regarding the two concessions we hold, one regarding the provision of public payphone services, and
another regarding the provision of directory services, which permit us to provide fixed line publicly available
payphones and directory (printed) and directory inquiry services (by phone and online) in Portugal, the status is
the following: (i) provision of public payphone services—the contract that supported the provision of this service,
which should have been terminated on April 8, 2019, and was initially extended by the government until
ANACOM selected a new provider or until the Communications Law was amended in order to waive such
selection, but the Portuguese Court of Auditors (Tribunal de Contas) did not approve the extension of the
agreement’s term so it was terminated with effects as of April 8, 2019; (ii) the provision of directory services—
the contract that supported the provision of this service ended on September 14, 2018, however, at the request of
the government, the provision of the directory inquiry services (by phone and online), was maintained; recently,
the government has determined that the provision of this service should cease immediately. Until June 1, 2014,
we were also the holders of the universal service public switched fixed-line concession, as described under “—
_The Fixed-Line Concession” below._

We also operate a DTT platform and provide mobile telephone services, data communications services and
television distribution services under the licenses granted and authorizations issued by the relevant authorities (the
Portuguese government and ANACOM).

The Ministry of Finance is responsible for monitoring financial issues with respect to our concessions. The
Ministry of Planning and Infrastructure is responsible for all other issues regarding our concessions. Disputes
concerning the application and interpretation of our concessions are resolved through arbitration. ANACOM is
responsible for issuing regulations and is authorized to monitor and apply administrative penalties up to a
maximum of €5 million and ancillary sanctions if we fail to fulfill our obligations under our concessions or other
obligations imposed by law.

_The Fixed-Line Concession_

The Portuguese government granted us a concession, held by PT OpCo, with an initial term expiring in 2025,
which was terminated early after PT OpCo and the Portuguese government reached an agreement in November
2013 on its revocation, following the designation of ZON and Optimus—currently NOS, after the merger of the


-----

two companies—as the universal service providers of access to a publicly available electronic communications
network and telephone services at a fixed location. On March 7, 2014, Decree Law 35/2014 was published in the
Portuguese official gazette, formally revoking our concession agreement pursuant to the November 2013
revocation agreement signed by us and the Portuguese government and also pursuant to Resolution of the Council
of Ministers n. 66-A/2013, of October 18, 2013, that authorized that revocation agreement. The revocation became
effective on June 1, 2014. As of that date, the fixed-line universal services are being provided by NOS, under a
contract that ended on June 1, 2019 (the government has informed that after the termination of the contract it
would not designate a new provider of this universal service). The revocation was due to, amongst other factors,
a decision from the CJEU, of October 7, 2010, on the grounds that Law 5/2004, of February 10, 2004, whilst
keeping in force PT OpCo’s universal services concession until 2025, did not comply with Directive 2002/22/CE,
of the European Parliament and the Council, of March 7, 2002, as amended by Directive 2009/36/CE, of the
European Parliament and the Council, of November 25, 2009.

The fixed-line concession granted us the right to install, manage and operate the infrastructure that forms part of
the basic telecommunications network. It also stipulated the provision of maritime mobile service, fixed telex
service, fixed switched data transmission service and telegraph service, as services of public interest. Under the
2004 Communications Law, as the Universal Service Provider, PT OpCo was also obligated to provide a
comprehensive directory and directory inquiry services. However, other than our ceasing to be the Universal
Service Provider (except with respect to public payphones and directory services, which we have been awarded
under new concession contracts), as described in “—Areas of Recent Regulation and Updates—Universal Service
_Obligations” below, the revocation of the fixed-line concession will not cause any material change in the_
telecommunications services we are able to provide.

Prior to the revocation of the fixed-line concession, the Portuguese government, by resolution of the Council of
Ministers of January 10, 2013, determined that the maritime mobile service should cease to be provided as a
service of public interest from April 30, 2013. After informing the subscribers of this service of the termination
in advance, PT OpCo proceeded to terminate it. In addition, pursuant to the Resolution of the Council of Ministers
published on October 18, 2013, fixed telex service, fixed switched data transmission service and telegraph service
(telegrams) no longer had the nature of public services as of January 31, 2014, thus terminating PT OpCo’s legal
obligation to assure their provision. The clients of the first two services were informed of such discontinuation in
advance. PT OpCo opted to commercially continue the provision of fixed telegraph service as of February 1, 2014.

_Our Public Payphones and Directory Services Concessions_

On October 12, 2012, in anticipation of the renegotiation of the fixed-line concession and following ANACOM’s
decision on the designation of a universal service provider under a competitive process, PT OpCo submitted the
single bid in the public tender for the provision of the publicly available telephones service and was awarded with
the concession contract. The concession contract was entered into on February 20, 2014, for a period of five years.
The conclusion of the public payphone installation ended on June 30, 2015. This contract was extended for another
year by government’s ruling of April 9, 2019, but the Portuguese Court of Auditors (Tribunal de Contas) did not
approve the extension of the agreement’s term so it was terminated with effects as of April 8, 2019.

On July 29, 2013, the Portuguese government decided to initiate a direct award procedure in respect of the
provision of comprehensive directory and directory inquiry services for a period of 12 months, with the possibility
of such period being extended for an additional six months. As the only company that presented a proposal, on
November 7, 2013, the Portuguese government awarded PT OpCo with the comprehensive directory and directory
inquiry services concession. The concession contract was entered into on February 20, 2014.

As mentioned above, the contract that supported the provision of this service ended on September 14, 2018.
Following a request of the government, the provision of the directory inquiry services (by phone and online), was
maintained. However, recently, the government has determined that the provision of this service by PT OpCo
should cease and be run by ANACOM instead. Currently, the service is being provided by PT OpCo only to its
clients, and PT OpCo is still awaiting a contact from ANACOM in connection with the migration of the service.

_DTT Services_

For a summary of our usage rights for DTT, see “—Areas of Recent Regulation and Updates—DTT Services”
below.


-----

_Our Fixed-line, Data and Frequency Use Licenses_

We also hold the following licenses: (i) a non-exclusive license to provide fixed-line telephone services and be a
“Public Telecommunications Networks” operator; (ii) the licenses formerly held by Telepac and other subsidiaries,
including a data communications license; and (iii) frequency use licenses. Licenses have also been granted to
other providers of data communications and internet access services, including companies associated with major
international telecommunications providers. However, companies are not required to have a license to provide
data communications services and internet access. Instead, it is sufficient to register their intended services with
ANACOM under its service registration scheme. Since 1997, we have also held a license to provide data
communications services using satellite infrastructure and a license to offer voice services to corporate networks
and other closed groups of users.

_PT OpCo Mobile Service License_

Portuguese mobile telephone service licenses are valid for 15 years and are issued by ANACOM. These licenses
authorize the use of radio spectrum and the installation of base stations, base station controllers and control
switching centers and require the licensee to construct networks capable of reaching at least 75% of Portugal’s
population within a specified period. Charges for the provision of mobile telephone services are not subject to
regulation.

Through PT OpCo we hold a renewable license to provide traditional and GSM digital mobile telephone services
throughout Portugal. The authorization for the use of GSM radio spectrum is valid until March 16, 2022. We are
required to comply with a number of mobile telephone service criteria, including satisfying minimum quality
standards regarding blocked call rates, network effectiveness and servicing time, and providing certain services.
We are also required to provide ANACOM with information about our mobile telephone operations, including
the number of customers, number and average duration of calls on a quarterly basis, and annual information about
the development of infrastructure.

ANACOM also issues UMTS licenses, which are the European version of the globally accepted technical
standards for 3G mobile communications. The broadband capacity of the frequency spectrum allocated under the
UMTS licenses enables operators to supply video and internet content to mobile telephones at higher transmission
speeds. On January 5, 2012, ANACOM issued a final report on an auction for the allocation of rights of use of
frequencies in the 450, 800, 900, 1800 MHz and 2.1 and 2.6 GHz bands. Following that auction, on March 9,
2012, ANACOM issued the final renewable license to PT OpCo, allowing the provision of electronic
communications services based, among others, on LTE technology. This license is valid until March 2027, and it
also unifies the previous GSM and UMTS licenses issued by ANACOM.

On February 18, 2016, following a public consultation on the subject, ANACOM renewed PT OpCo’s right of
use of the 1920-1980 MHz/2110-2170 MHz sub-bands by 15 years. The decision entered into effect on April 22,
2018.

On February 6, 2020, ANACOM approved the project for the regulation of the 5G auction for the attribution of
rights of use of frequencies in the 700, 900, 1800 MHz, 2.1, 2.6 and 3.6 GHz bands (5G), and subjected the project
to a public consultation. The regulation was finally approved in October 2020 and published in November 2020.
PT OpCo submitted a request to participate in the auction, which was accepted. The main auction phase started
on January 14, 2021, and is still ongoing.

**_Areas of Recent Regulation and Updates_**

_Number Portability and Carrier Selection_

Number portability allows a subscriber at a specific location to change service providers without having to change
telephone numbers. Under ANACOM regulations, we are required to allow number portability for both fixed-line
and mobile services within one working day, save for in exceptional circumstances duly identified. Call-by-call
carrier selection enables customers to select the carrier of their calls by dialing a code connecting them to the
selected carrier, while carrier pre-selection allows customers to select the carrier that will be their default carrier.

ANACOM’s regulatory intervention in the wholesale market for call origination on the public telephone network
provided at a fixed location for the provision of retail telephone services supported by indirect access (preselection or call-by-call selection) or the wholesale line reference offer ceased in 2018. Nevertheless, we were


-----

subject, on a temporary basis, to price control obligations, which were lifted 18 months following the decision of
October 4, 2018.

_DTT Services_

PT OpCo holds frequency usage rights for DTT associated with the transport of the signal of free-to-air television
channels (the RTP, SIC and TVI broadcast channels), the so-called “Multiplex A” or “Mux A”. PT OpCo is
entitled to receive compensation or reimbursement, to be provided pursuant to a governmental ordinance, for the
costs related to the channel update process which occurred in 2011 to allow the release of the 800 MHz band. The
switch-off of the analog television network in Portugal occurred on April 26, 2012. Designed to ensure equal
access to DTT, the DTT usage rights require PT OpCo to subsidize the installation and purchase of DTT-related
equipment for individuals with special needs (e.g. the elderly, low income groups, etc.).

In September 2014, ANACOM issued a decision authorizing PT OpCo to implement four additional MFN
channels to function alongside its SFN network. In the decision ANACOM also expressed the view that in certain
municipalities PT OpCo’s network does not comply with its license and therefore PT OpCo must implement an
additional five MFN channels to function alongside its SFN network. PT OpCo considers itself to have fulfilled
its obligations with respect to the usage grant and to have successfully concluded the channel update process and
therefore has expressed its disagreement to ANACOM over the alleged breach of its obligations under its DTT
license. In October 2015 ANACOM issued a decision on that matter and considered that the implementation of
an additional five MFN channels was not necessary.

In October 2015, ANACOM published a decision relating to DTT coverage in which it defined coverage
obligations by municipality depending on population as well as what constituted a period of unavailability. PT
OpCo had replied to the consultation that preceded this decision expressing its disagreement on certain matters,
such as the definition of coverage obligations noted above, that, if implemented, may have a material impact on
the fulfilment of its service obligations under its DTT license. PT OpCo initiated a legal proceeding against this
decision which is still on-going.

On September 22, 2016, following the enactment of Law 33/2016, of August 24, 2016 and the approval of the
Resolution of the Council of Ministers 37-C/2016, of July 8, 2016, ANACOM issued a public consultation on its
draft decision regarding an amendment to the conditions attached to the right of use of frequencies allocated to
PT OpCo for DTT. On December 21, 2016, ANACOM issued its decision, through which, namely, two capacity
reservations were removed and four new capacity reservation obligations were imposed, which intended: (i) for
the broadcast of two national television program services, RTP3 and RTP Memória, in SDTV definition; and
(ii) for the broadcast of two free-to-air unrestricted television program services in SDTV definition, to be licensed
under Law 27/2007, of July 30, 2007.

In June 2018 ANACOM issued the national roadmap for the release of the 700 MHz band, which is necessary for
5G mobile development within the framework of international agreements and the determinations of the European
Parliament and of the Council. In October 2019 ANACOM issued its decision amending the national roadmap
previously issued and approving the development plan for the migration of the DTT to the sub-700 MHz frequency
band and the timeline to be followed by PT OpCo as well as imposing obligations to be followed by the latter
necessary for the conclusion of the migration procedure. The decision established that the migration procedure
would unfold gradually within a period of six months starting in January 2020, beginning from the country’s south
to the north regions ending in the autonomous regions of Madeira and Azores. In order to offer support to the
users, ANACOM would make available a call centre with a free phone-line.

The national roadmap proposed by ANACOM and approved by the Secretary of State for Infrastructure provides
for the adoption of the simplest migration scenario, through the maintenance of current technology and without
the need for any period of simultaneous transmission. This scenario only entails the tuning of equipment to the
new frequency, i.e. there will be no need to acquire any new equipment or repoint antennas. Despite the simplicity
of the process, ANACOM offered support to users, as per the plan prepared accordingly.

On March 27, 2020, ANACOM approved an amendment to the national roadmap for the 700 MHz band, following
the decision issued by ANACOM on March 12, 2020, in which it decided to suspend the DTT network migration
process due to reasons of force majeure, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 16, 2020,
ANACOM approved the adjustment of the scheduling for the conclusion of the DTT network migration process
in the context of the release of the 700 MHz band and the DTT network migration process resumed on August 12,
2020. On September 10, 2020, ANACOM approved the second amendment to the national roadmap for the


-----

process of release of the 700 MHz band, in which it sets out the amendments to the migration plan and schedule.
The migration started in February 2020, was temporarily interrupted due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
and was finally concluded on December 18, 2020.

_Wholesale Reference Offers (Unbundling the Local Loop)_

The EC requires fixed-line network operators found to have significant market power in the relevant wholesale
market for physical network infrastructure access at a fixed location to make the local loops between their
customers and the local switches on their networks available to competitors. This allows such competitors to
connect their networks to the copper local loop and use it to provide their services directly to those customers
without having to invest in the local loop or to rely upon the network operator’s relationship with the customers.
Under this regulation, we are required to maintain a reference offer for unbundled access to our local loops and
related facilities and to meet reasonable requests for unbundled access to our local loops and related facilities
under transparent, fair and non-discriminatory conditions. Prices charged must be cost-oriented. The conditions
under which the local loop unbundling services are provided are set forth in a published reference offer for
unbundled access to our local loops in accordance with terms established by ANACOM. This reference offer
covers all of our main distribution framework buildings where technical and space conditions allow co-location.
Co-location means providing space and technical facilities to competitors to the extent necessary to reasonably
accommodate and connect the relevant equipment of the competitor.

_Leased Lines Reference Offers and Ethernet Access Reference Offers_

Our Leased Lines Reference Offer (oferta de referência de circuitos alugados), or “ORCA”, sets forth the
characteristics and the technical and commercial conditions associated with the provision of leased circuits by PT
OpCo in the wholesale markets. Our Ethernet Accesses Reference Offer (oferta de referência de circuitos
_Ethernet), or “ORCE”, sets forth the characteristics and the technical and commercial conditions associated with_
the provision of ethernet circuits by PT OpCo in the wholesale markets.

Following a decision by ANACOM on leased line markets, the retail leased-line market was deregulated meaning
that our prices in this market ceased to be subject to a 26% retail-minus rule. However, for the wholesale leasedline markets, in which we were declared an operator with significant market power, ANACOM decided to make
Ethernet circuits subject to a retail-minus rule (which remains undefined by ANACOM). On June 14, 2012,
ANACOM approved a final decision amending our ORCA and ORCE, the draft decision of which has been
provided to the EC (which has subsequently stated it had no comment to the action), BEREC and national
regulatory authorities of other EU Member States. PT Opco challenged this decision before the courts, arguing
that the decision was illegal in certain respects; however, PT OpCo dropped the proceedings in 2021.

On July 23, 2015, ANACOM approved an urgent and interim decision regarding the market for wholesale leased
lines, by which it reduced by 50% the wholesale price of CAM (Continent - Azores - Madeira) leased lines.

On September 1, 2016, following the analysis of the market for high-quality wholesale access at a fixed location
(market 4), ANACOM imposed a reduction of 72.8% in the price of Ethernet leased lines (capacity of up to 10
Gbps) between Mainland Portugal and the Autonomous Regions of the Azores and Madeira (CAM circuits) and
between the various islands of each region (inter-island circuits), where supported on PT OpCo’s submarine cables.
The reduction came on top of a 50% reduction ordered by ANACOM in July 2015 as part of an urgent adopted
measure. In total, the reduction in prices totaled 86% over one year. We have challenged the 2015 decision before
the courts. Subsequently, (i) on March 1, 2019, ANACOM imposed a reduction of 10% in the price of Ethernet
leased lines (capacity of up to 10 Gbps) for the CAM circuits and of 6% for the inter-island circuits, (ii) on
February 2, 2020, it imposed a reduction of 10% in the price of Ethernet leased lines (capacity of up to 10 Gbps)
for the CAM circuits and of 4% for the inter-island circuits and (iii) on March 3, 2021, it imposed a reduction of
10% in the price of Ethernet leased lines (capacity of up to 10 Gbps) for the CAM circuits and established the
maintenance of the prices for the inter-island circuits.

On October 12, 2017, ANACOM approved the amendments to the ORCA and to the ORCE, whose final decision
draft had been notified to the EC, the BEREC and the national regulatory authorities of the other EU Member
States. By letter dated September 28, 2017, the EC stated it had no comments on the final decision draft.


-----

_Co-installation Obligations_

The June 14, 2012, decision regarding PT OpCo’s ORCA and ORCE, ANACOM extended PT OpCo’s coinstallation obligations under its regulated reference offers to its submarine cable landing stations (ECS). The
obligation remains in place by force of the decision of September 1, 2016, which specifies that co-location may
take place in the ECS itself, in spaces adjacent or remote.

_Wholesale Market for Voice Call Termination on Individual Mobile Networks_

The regulation of the market for wholesale voice call termination establishes a price control obligation on
wholesale voice call termination services. Following EC recommendations on the regulatory treatment of fixed
and mobile termination rates in the EU, this price control results in a cost-oriented price cap determined by a pure
Long-Run Average Incremental Cost, or “LRIC”, bottom-up cost model.

On July 21, 2018, ANACOM approved its decision regarding the specification on price control obligation in the
wholesale market for voice call termination on individual mobile networks (Market 2/2014). The maximum price
to be applied by the three mobile operators considered to have significant market power was set at €0.42 per
minute, billed per second from the first second and independent of the origin of the call. From July 1, 2019 that
price decreased to €0.40 per minute, following the yearly update of the inputs used in the model to determine such
price.

On February 20, 2020, ANACOM determined that from July 1, 2020, the maximum termination price for voice
calls in mobile networks to be applied by mobile operators with significant market power would be further
decreased to €0.36 per minute.

_Next Generation Access Networks_

By decision of March 23, 2017, ANACOM approved the analysis of markets 3a and 3b, in which it identified as
relevant for the purposes of ex ante regulation the wholesale local access market provided at a fixed location; and
the market of wholesale central access provided at a fixed location (for major consumer products) in Areas NC
(non-competitive). Areas C (competitive) are not subject to ex ante regulation, and correspond to 466 parishes out
of a total of 3092.

ANACOM imposed in both markets (3a and 3b-NC) obligations of access to the network and use of specific
network resources, of non-discrimination, transparency, accounting separation, price control and cost accounting
and financial report. ANACOM didn’t impose access to PT OpCo’s optic fiber network, as it considered sufficient
the obligations, imposed at national level, of access to ducts and poles, as well as copper network access
obligations which PT OpCo is also required to meet.

In September 2019, ANACOM issued a decision regarding the amendments made by PT OpCo to its reference
wholesale offer for the access to ducts (Oferta de Referência de Acesso a Condutas) and reference wholesale offer
for the access to ducts (Oferta de Referência de Acesso a Postes).

With respect to the roll-out of optic fiber networks, current Portuguese law establishes a legal framework for the
construction of and access to infrastructure suitable for the accommodation of electronic communications
networks and the construction of infrastructure for telecommunications in housing developments, urban
settlements and concentrations of buildings. The law addresses access to the public domain, expropriation and the
constitution of public easements, and amendments to existing law in 2009 introduced a new level of harmonization
and transparency in procedures. In particular, the 2009 changes set forth several obligations in order to allow
electronic communications operators to enjoy better conditions necessary for the installation and development of
electronic communications networks.

The current legal framework also foresees the implementation of a Centralized Information System (“SIIA”), to
be managed and operated by ANACOM and whose main objective is to make available information on
infrastructure appropriate for the installation of electronic communications networks based on information
provided by the Portuguese government, autonomous regions, municipalities, publicly held companies or
concessionaires, other entities owning or using infrastructure in the public domain, autonomous regions or
municipalities and electronic communications undertakings. Other elements, such as the terms upon which objects
will be geographically defined through the combination of their administrative location and georeferencing, are
also set forth. SIIA became available on January 14, 2016.


-----

On May 15, 2014, Directive 2014/61, on measures to reduce the cost of deploying high-speed electronic
communications networks, was enacted and transposition by Member-States should have occurred no later than
January 1, 2016. Directive 2014/61 was transposed by Decree Law 92/2017, of July 31, 2017, which has modified
Decree Law 123/2009, of May 21, 2009. Decree Law 92/2017, of July 31, 2017, established several obligations
regarding the Adequate Infrastructures Information System, formerly SIC, in order to make available permanently
updated information on appropriate infrastructures. It has also extended the range of situations in which can be
requested the intervention of ANACOM to dispute resolutions.

On September 9, 2013, the EC published the recommendation on non-discrimination and NGA cost models,
included in the presentation and proposal of the so-called Connected Continent package. The (non-binding)
recommendation aims to promote investment and innovation in new network infrastructures, while ensuring
effective competition. In particular, it seeks to: (i) ensure an effective level playing field through the application
of stricter rules on non-discrimination; (ii) set predictable and stable prices for access to copper networks; and
(iii) increase regulatory certainty as to the circumstances that should lead to the non-imposition of regulated prices
for wholesale access to next-generation networks.

_Cost Accounting System (“CAS”)_

PT OpCo runs an activity-based, fully-distributed historical cost model, first developed following the privatization
of the company in 1995. The CAS is also a regulatory obligation imposed on PT OpCo within the scope of our
concession and relevant market regulations.

On March 19, 2020, ANACOM declared the conformity of PT OpCo’s CAS for the exercise of 2017 with the
applicable regulatory dispositions and approved determinations concerning the improvement of the CAS.

On June 30, 2020, PT OpCo submitted to ANACOM the results of its CAS for year 2019; complementary
information was sent subsequently.

On December 4, 2020, ANACOM declared the conformity of PT OpCo’s CAS for the exercise of 2018 with the
applicable regulatory dispositions and approved determinations concerning the improvement of the CAS.

_Regulation on the settlement and collection of regulatory fees_

According to the Administrative Rule 1473-B/2008 of December 17, 2008, all providers are subject to the
payment of a regulatory fee for the provision of electronic communications networks and services, through which
they cover the administrative regulatory costs of ANACOM.

By deliberation dated November 12, 2020, ANACOM approved the report concerning its administrative costs and
the amount resulting from the collection of the fees owed by the suppliers of networks and electronic
telecommunication services for 2020. The contributory percentage t2 was set at 0.8102% for a total of €33,819,903
of administrative costs.

It is worth noting that t2 has increased sustainably throughout the years (in spite of a small decrease in the 2019
contributory percentage), as can be seen from the series below:

        - 2009 - 0,4040%

        - 2010 - 0,4133%

        - 2011 - 0,4361%

        - 2012 - 0,4590%

        - 2013 - 0,5490%

        - 2014 - 0,5909%

        - 2015 - 0,6214%


-----

        - 2016 - 0,6885%

        - 2017 - 0,7195%

        - 2018 - 0,7915%

        - 2019 - 0,7851%

        - 2020 - 0,8102%

_Universal Service Obligations_

Until June 1, 2014, we had obligations as a universal service provider under the fixed-line concession for public
telecommunications service. Universal services are divided into three functions: (i) connection to a public
telecommunications network at a fixed location and the provision of public telephone services; (ii) publicly
available telephones; and (iii) comprehensive directory and directory inquiry services. Under the tender for
designation of the Universal Service Provider described below, these functions are further divided into three
geographic regions: North, Center and South and Islands. On October 12, 2012, following ANACOM’s decision
on the designation of a universal service provider, the Portuguese Ministries of Finance, Economy and
Employment launched a public tender to designate universal service providers for each of the three functions
described above (referred to as Tender 1, Tender 2 and Tender 3 respectively), which included a compensation
fund for universal service providers, as described below, and a related renegotiation of our concession which led
to its revocation. To select the company responsible for providing a comprehensive directory and a directory
inquiry service, the criterion was the highest remuneration payable to the Portuguese government. The granting
period for each of the services was set at five years. Pursuant to the qualifying report issued on February 2, 2013,
PT OpCo qualified for each of the Tender 1, Tender 2 and Tender 3 categories. The deadline for the submission
of proposals for each of these tenders was March 15, 2013. PT OpCo, ZON and Optimus presented bids for Tender
1, PT OpCo presented the only bid for Tender 2, and no bids were presented for Tender 3.

On April 18, 2013, ANACOM published a preliminary report regarding the bids for Tenders 1 and 2, as there was
no bidder in Tender 3. In accordance with this report, PT OpCo did not present the lowest bid in Tender 1 (which
was the relevant criterion for this tender) and, as such, it did not qualify to be designated as the universal service
provider of access to a public telecommunications network at a fixed location. PT OpCo’s services in this regard
ceased on June 1, 2014. See “—Our Concessions and Existing Licenses and Authorizations—The Fixed-Line
_Concession” above._

PT OpCo submitted the lowest bid for Tender 2.

On October 18, 2013, the Portuguese government confirmed these results and determined the designation of
Optimus and ZON as the universal service providers for the connection to a public electronic communications
network at a fixed location and the provision of publicly available telephone services, and of PT OpCo as the
universal service provider for publicly available telephone (payphones).

In addition, on November 7, 2013, PT OpCo was awarded by the Portuguese government with the comprehensive
directory and directory inquiry services concession. See “—Our Concessions and Existing Licenses and
_Authorizations—Our Public Payphones and Directory Services Concessions”._

Furthermore, even in the cases where PT OpCo is the universal services provider, we will be required to contribute
to the compensation fund for universal services providers according to our share of the revenues of the national
telecommunications sector.

By a deliberation dated August 1, 2013, ANACOM approved the draft decision on the final results of the audit to
NCUS resubmitted by PT OpCo for 2007 to 2009: €23,584,976.93 in 2007, €20,168,431.93 in 2008 and
€23,057,573.48 in 2009. This draft decision was submitted to prior hearing of the interested parties and public
consultation. On September 19, 2013, ANACOM approved the final decision having maintained the values
proposed on the draft decision.

On August 19, 2013, following a deliberation by ANACOM dated June 20, 2013, regarding the decision on the
results of the audit to NCUS for 2007 to 2009, PT OpCo sent to ANACOM new values for the NCUS in 2010 and
2011, according to the final, settled methodology. According to Law 35/2012, which established the compensation


-----

fund for the universal service of electronic communications, for the financing of the NCUS, on October 31, 2013,
PT OpCo submitted to ANACOM the calculation of the NCUS for 2012, taking into account the deliberations of
the Regulatory Authority concerning the methodology of calculation of the NCUS and the recommendations made
in the audit of the NCUS for 2007 to 2009.

After submission to prior hearing of the interest parties and to public consultation, ANACOM approved on June 12,
2014, the final results of the audit to NCUS submitted by PT OpCo for 2010 and 2011: €24,662,548.33 and
€25,205,213.31, respectively.

On September 25, 2014, ANACOM approved the draft decision on the final results of the audit to NCUS
resubmitted by PT OpCo for 2010 and 2011: €23,522,982.66 and €23,527,625.33, respectively. This draft decision
was then submitted to prior hearing of the interested parties and public consultation. On November 20, 2014,
ANACOM approved the final decision having maintained the values proposed on the draft decision.

On September 16, 2015, ANACOM approved the final results of the audit to NCUS submitted by PT OpCo for
2012, in the amount of €26,423,507.39, after being submitted to prior hearing of the interest parties and to public
consultation.

On December 17, 2015, ANACOM approved—also after being submitted to prior hearing of the interest parties
and to public consultation—the final results of the audit to NCUS submitted by PT OpCo for 2013, in the amount
of €20,343,490.71.

On October 27, 2016, ANACOM approved—after being submitted to prior hearing of the interest parties and to
public consultation—the final results of the audit to NCUS submitted by PT OpCo for 2014, in the amount of
€7,724,670.71.

On January 26, 2017, ANACOM approved the final results of the NCUS incurred by PT OpCo in 2015, in the
amount of €2,466,599.66 (Public Payphones concession) and €189,132.39 (Directory Services concession).

On January 26, 2018, ANACOM approved the final results of the NCUS incurred by PT OpCo in 2016, in the
amount of €2,466,386.37 (Public Payphones concession) and €636,078.95 (Directory Services concession).

On January 17, 2019, ANACOM approved the final results of the NCUS incurred by PT OpCo in 2017, in the
amount of €2,464,144.53 (Public Payphones concession) and €635,431.40 (Directory Services concession);
however, on January 31, 2019, ANACOM dispensed PT OpCo from making the relevant contributions to the
NCUS.

On January 17, 2020, ANACOM approved the final results of the NCUS incurred by PT OpCo in 2018, in the
amount of €2,466,600.00 (Public Payphones concession) and €446,355.35 (Directory Services concession).

On January 28, 2021, ANACOM approved the final results of the NCUS incurred by PT OpCo in 2019, in the
amount of €662,128.84 (Public Payphones concession).

_Network Security_

On December 12, 2013, ANACOM approved a decision on the circumstances, format, and procedures applicable
to reports regarding security breaches or loss of integrity with a significant impact on the functioning of electronic
communications networks and services available to the public. This decision also sets forth the conditions under
which ANACOM considers there is a public interest in disclosing information regarding those events to the public.
Further, we implemented all the necessary measures to comply with this decision by June 12, 2014, which required
implementing new procedures and adapting information systems to produce the relevant information to notify to
ANACOM.

On March 14, 2019, ANACOM approved the ANACOM Regulation 303/2019 on the security and integrity of
electronic communications networks and services.

This Regulation establishes the obligation to identify the assets of companies whose operation is critical and
should be classified and inventoried. It also establishes the strengthening of the capacity of articulation between
ANACOM and the companies of the sector, whether in response times or in terms of contents, as well as with
other sectors that depend on electronic communications. The new rules also foresee the appointment of a security


-----

officer and the adoption of a security policy at companies that offer public communications networks or electronic
communications services accessible to the public. The regulation is based on the clear identification that the good
operation of the networks and services is important in normal daily situations, but above all in emergency
situations in which preparation and planning is crucial, and mutual assistance is determinant to achieving common
goals. The diploma came into force on April 2, in its entirety but provides for several obligations to be
implemented in a phased manner.

_Cloud Computing_

The EC issued a review of cloud computing in Europe with the goal of enabling and facilitating its adoption
throughout all sectors of the economy with the goal of cutting ICT costs and boosting productivity, growth and
jobs. The EC put forward a set of measures that, in its view, are key to promoting cloud computing and ensuring
users’ rights.

On December 12, 2012, the Directorate General for Justice organized a workshop on cloud computing contracts,
with the purpose of exploring stakeholders’ experiences and views on cloud computing contracts with the EC.
The EC and stakeholders discussed possible future developments of the market, issues relating to cloud computing
contracts, based on existing practice, the economic impact of these issues in cloud computing contracts and the
possible ways forward. The EC considered the workshop a first step to find a precise feasible mandate for an
expert group that was formed in September 2013 to address cloud computing issues pertaining to fair and balanced
contract terms, trust of consumers and users and increased legal certainty. The EC published on June 24, 2014 its
Cloud Service Level Agreement Standardisation Guidelines. On April 19, 2016, building on its earlier work on
this area, the EC issued a communication (COM(2016) 178 final) on the European Cloud Initiative—Building a
competitive data and knowledge economy in Europe, where it announced that the “European Cloud Initiative will
be complemented by further action under the Digital Single Market Strategy covering cloud contracts for business
users and switching of cloud services providers.

_Cinema Law_

The Law 55/2012, of September 6, 2012 (the “Cinema Law”), as amended by Law 28/2014, of May 19, 2014,
by Law 82-B/2014, of December 31, 2014, and by Law 74/2020, of November 19, 2020, establishes the
Portuguese government action principles in the promotion, development and protection of the art of cinema and
cinematographic and audio-visual activities, which imposes obligations on television distributors and operators of
video-on-demand services.

As a result, on one hand, television distributors are obligated to reverse charge an annual fee for each subscription
of television services (€2 per subscription) by July 1 of the following year to which the data reported relates (as
per the rules of Decree Law 25/2018, of April 24, 2018), as well as the obligation to provide to the Portuguese
Cinema and Audiovisual Institute (Instituto do Cinema e do Audiovisual), or “ICA”, with the reports that were
sent to ANACOM regarding the number of television services subscribers.

On the other hand, operators of video-on-demand services are obligated to invest 1% of video-on-demand services
revenues. Additionally, from 2021 onwards, operators of subscription video-on-demand services will also be
obligated to deliver to ICA 1% of such service’s revenues. A new regulation regarding these two obligations is
still to be issued.

_Roaming_

The EC regulates the roaming charges that may be charged in the wholesale market and the retail market in Europe.
These regulations extend to data and SMS, or text messaging. On July 1, 2012, the previous roaming regulations
were replaced by a new version, known as “Roaming III”, which will expire on June 30, 2022. In addition to
setting maximum voice roaming rates (subject to a glide path) that may be charged with respect to the wholesale
market, retail market, data and SMS, Roaming III also features (i) extended transparency and consumer-protection
measures (“bill-shock”) that go beyond the EU territory, (ii) a cap on retail data roaming communications, (iii) the
introduction of an obligation for mobile operators in the wholesale market to provide reasonable network access
in order to allow roaming services and (iv) the decoupling of roaming services from other services, while enabling
a consumer to use the same number, no later than July 1, 2014.

On July 1, 2013, the new price caps, valid until July 2014, entered into force:


-----

        - For voice calls, €0.24 per minute (retail) for outgoing calls and €0.07 per minute (retail) and
€0.10 per minute (wholesale) for incoming calls;

        - For outgoing SMS, €0.08 (retail) and €0.02 (wholesale); and

        - For data traffic, €0.45 per MB (retail) and €0.15 per MB (wholesale).

        - As of July 1, 2014, the price caps, valid until June 30, 2017 (retail level), and June 30, 2022
(wholesale level), if not revised before, shall be:

        - For voice calls, €0.19 per minute (retail) for outgoing calls and €0.05 per minute (retail and
wholesale) for incoming calls;

        - For outgoing SMS, €0.06 (retail) and €0.02 (wholesale); and

        - For data traffic, €0.20/MB (retail) and €0.05/MB (wholesale).

On March 18, 2013, BEREC published its guidelines on the interpretation and implementation of Roaming
Regulation III, except with regard to Articles 3, 4 and 5 concerning the wholesale access and the separate sale of
roaming services. Issues concerning wholesale access had already been object of specific guidelines, published
on September 27, 2012, and the separate roaming services (single IMSI and LBO—Local break-out) sale was also
object of specific guidance, published on July 5, 2013.

Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 of 25 November, introduced the so called TSM (“Telecom Single Market”) which,
among other dispositions, brought very important modifications to Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 on roaming on
public mobile communications networks within the Union.

As part of this regulation the Roam Like At Home (RLAH) regime entered into force on June 15, 2017. Since that
date roaming providers are no longer allowed to levy surcharges in addition to the domestic retail price on roaming
customers in any EU Member State for regulated roaming calls made or received, for regulated roaming SMS
messages sent and for regulated data roaming services used (there was a transitory period of “RLAH+” between
April 30, 2016 and June 14, 2017, in which providers could still apply a surcharge in addition to the domestic
retail price for the provision of regulated retail roaming services).

Roaming providers may implement a ‘fair use policy’ (“FUP”) in order to prevent abusive or anomalous usage,
as per the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/2286 of December 15. Above the FUP limit,
surcharges may be applied as follows:

**Max. roaming surcharge** **Max. Σ domestic retail rate + roaming surcharge**

Voice—outgoing...................... 3.20 €cent/min* 19 €cent/min
Voice—incoming ..................... 0.85 €cent/min** n/a
SMS—outgoing ....................... 1 €cent/min* 6 €cent/min
Data .......................................... €4.40/GB* (until Dec. 31, 2019)*** 20 €cent/MB (i.e. €20/GB)

- Equivalent to the wholesale price caps (Regulation (EU) 2017/920 of 17 May regarding rules for wholesale roaming markets)

** Weighted average mobile termination rates across the Union

*** 2020: €3.50/GB; 2021: €3/GB; 2022: €2.50/GB (Regulation (EU) 2017/920 of 17 May regarding rules for wholesale roaming
markets)

BEREC published two sets of Guidelines regarding this regulation:

- Retail Roaming Guidelines (March 27, 2017)

- Wholesale Roaming Guidelines (June 9, 2017)


-----

_Net Neutrality_

Besides its impact on roaming, Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 of 25 November (“TSM”) also introduced measures
concerning open internet access and amended Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users’ rights relating
to electronic communications networks and services.

The Regulation imposed EU-wide rules on safeguarding open internet access (net neutrality) from April 30, 2016,
requiring providers of internet access services to treat all traffic equally, and establishing a right of all end-users
to access and distribute legal content, applications and services of their choice.

Providers may use reasonable traffic management measures that are to be based on objective technical
requirements, not commercial considerations. Blocking or throttling are allowed only in a limited number of
circumstances listed in the Regulation, for instance to block illegal content, counter a cyber attack or deal with
exceptional or temporary traffic congestion.

Agreements on services optimized for specific content are allowed where optimization is necessary, but providers
must ensure the general quality of internet access services. Examples of such specialized services are managed
IPTV and high-definition video conferencing.

‘Zero-rating’ practices are not explicitly banned. This means such practices will have to be assessed by the NRAs
on a case-by-case basis to establish harm to end-users before they can be prohibited.

On August 2016, BEREC published a set of Guidelines regarding the implementation of the net neutrality rules
by European NRAs.

_Intra-EU communications_

Regulation (EU) 2018/1971 of December 11, among other dispositions, amended TSM, by introducing rules
regarding maximum retail prices for intra-EU communications. As such, from May 15, 2019, any retail price
(excluding VAT) charged to consumers for regulated intra-EU communications shall not exceed EUR 0.19 per
minute for calls and EUR 0.06 per SMS message.

The regulation covers only consumption based intra-EU communications services offered to consumers and is
applicable to both fixed and mobile calls and SMS. In addition to the regulated tariff, providers may offer
alternative tariffs covering non-EEA countries including intra-EU communications where the prices of intra-EU
communications may exceed the caps; consumers should have the option to deliberately choose such tariffs.

On March 7, 2019, BEREC published a set Guidelines regarding this theme.

_Interconnection_

_The Interconnection Framework. The EU Access and Interconnection Directive requires that interconnection_
services be made available in a non-discriminatory manner. The EU Access and Interconnection Directive
encourages commercial negotiations among operators but requires national regulatory authorities to establish
mechanisms for effective dispute resolution. According to the EU Access and Interconnection Directive, all
telecommunications companies with significant market power in the call origination or termination markets must:

        - make interconnection access to their networks available to other network operators;

        - not discriminate between interconnection customers;

        - provide to those requesting interconnection the information and technical specifications
necessary for them to interconnect their networks;

        - offer interconnection prices that are transparent and cost-oriented and do not discriminate
between interconnection customers; and

        - maintain a separate accounting system for interconnection activities.


-----

The EU Access and Interconnection Directive established the general conditions for access and interconnection
among telecommunications operators in competitive markets. It guarantees the rights of new entrants to obtain
interconnection from telecommunications operators with significant market power. ANACOM is entitled to
review and modify our proposed interconnection rates and arrangements in our reference interconnection offer.
ANACOM has established an overall interconnection framework based on cost that is consistent with the EU legal
framework for both wireline and mobile services.

_Wireline Interconnection. ANACOM regulates call termination on individual public telephone networks provided_
at a fixed location within the scope of market analysis and significant market power designations. As a result, we
are subject to price controls in these markets based on our costs and other factors and must publish a reference
offer that includes these prices and quality of service standards. The obligation imposed on significant market
power operators to meet all reasonable requests for supply of fixed call termination services, under fair and
reasonable conditions, applies on an equal basis to TDM and IP interconnection. The specific conditions relating
to IP interconnection were the object of a decision by ANACOM (dated January 5, 2018), following a proposal
submitted by PT OpCo and discussed with the other providers.

_Mobile Interconnection. All mobile operators are considered to have significant market power in call termination_
in mobile networks market. ANACOM has imposed price controls on interconnection rates for the termination of
calls on mobile networks (see the evolution of values in section “—Wholesale Market for Voice Call Termination
_on Individual Mobile Networks” above). These reductions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a_
significant impact on PT OpCo’s interconnection revenues and consequently its earnings.

_Fixed Interconnection. All fixed operators are considered to have significant market power in call termination in_
fixed networks market. ANACOM has imposed price controls on interconnection rates for the termination of calls
on fixed networks. In its decision of February 2020, it set a fixed termination rate (“FTR”) at €0.046, which
applies from October 2020.

ANACOM has issued successive decisions that have reduced mobile termination rates over time. The reductions
in mobile termination rates have had, and will continue to have, a negative effect on our cash flows and revenues.

_Pricing for Mobile Origination Rates_

In January 2012, the Portuguese Competition Authority completed an analysis on mobile rates for originating
calls, finding origination rates to be excessive and stating that mobile operators must reduce their rates to the level
of their costs by July 2012 or face the possibility of being sanctioned. All three mobile network operators decided
to reduce its mobile originating rates between €0.07 and €0.0975 and no subsequent action from the Authority is
expected.

_Internet and Related Services_

Various regulatory developments may affect our internet business. A Data Retention Directive (Directive
2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and the Council, of March 15) was adopted by the EC in 2006, that
imposed data-retention obligations on operators. The law implementing this directive, more specifically, Law
32/2008 of July 17, 2008, requires internet service providers and other electronic communications providers to
preserve data for a specified period of time and imposes other obligations in this area.

_Regulatory Proceedings_

We are regularly involved in regulatory inquiries and investigations involving our operations. In addition,
ANACOM, the EC, the Portuguese Competition Authority and ERC regularly make inquiries and conduct
investigations concerning our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These investigations are described
in more detail in “Description of Our Business—Legal Proceedings—Portugal”.

**_Regulatory obligations_**

For both mobile and fixed telephony services, operators are obligated to ensure the effective transfer of the number
within a maximum period of one business day from the presentation of the request by the subscriber before the
new operator pursuant to ANACOM Regulation 114/2012 on number portability.


-----

Under Decree Law 7/2004 of January 7, 2004, as amended, internet service providers are not liable for information
transmitted over their electronic communications network provided that they are not the disclosing party of the
transmitted information, do not select or modify neither the information nor its recipients. Storage providers can
only become liable for unlawfully stored information provided that they become aware of the unlawful use of that
information and, upon becoming aware, do not take action to remove or to disable access to the information.

Under Law 41/2004 of August 18, 2004, regulating the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy
in the electronic communications sector, as amended, it is necessary to obtain the prior consent of the user to store
information and to access stored information in the user’s equipment, as well as to send unrequested
communications for direct marketing purposes. Electronic communications services providers are demanded to
notify the Comissão Nacional de Protecção de Dados in cases of breach of personal data of the users.

**_Consumer protection_**

Law 23/96 of July 26, 1996 establishes that debts of consumers to electronic communications services providers
are subject to a six month expiration period, starting from the moment the services were provided. Consumer
protection was strengthened by Law 10/2013 of January 28, 2013, establishing rules on the mandatory suspension
and/or termination of the service provision in a short period of time in case the consumer fails to pay an invoice
on the due date.

**_Fees and contributions_**

ANACOM collects an annual regulation fee from electronic communications services providers and other
regulation fees that are directly related to its activity, such as a fee for granting the usage of certain numbers or
certain frequencies. Such fees were revised by Administrative Rule 157/2017 of May 10, 2017, amending
Administrative Rule 1473-B/2008 of December 17, 2008.

ERC also collects annual regulation fees regarding some of our activities, namely regarding television distribution
and social media (Portal SAPO—news aggregator).

Municipalities collect a municipal fee for rights of way (the “MFRW”), established in the 2004 Communications
Law, based on the provider’s turnover concerning end users in each municipality. The fee is freely established by
each municipality, up to a maximum of 0.25% of each wireline services bill and is supported the operators whose
network infrastructures are located in each such municipality (without the possibility of making them reflect on
the customers). It is our, and the courts, understanding that this MFRW exempts us from the payment of other
municipal taxes related with rights of way, so PT OpCo has challenged in court all the taxes applied by
municipalities regarding rights of way, on the grounds that these represent double taxation, and the courts (in all
instances, up to the Portuguese Supreme Administrative Court) ruled in favor of PT OpCo’s position.

**Dominican Republic**

**_Overview_**

The legal framework of the telecommunications sector in the Dominican Republic is set forth by General
Telecommunications Law 153-98 of May 27, 1998 (Mod.) (“Law 153-98”), resolutions issued by the
telecommunications regulator on the grounds of Law 153-98 and various decrees of the Executive Power on
matters related to the National Plan of Attribution of Frequencies (“PNAF”).

We believe that we hold all necessary licenses to operate our business. On July 15, 1996, Altice Dominicana was
awarded a nineteen-year universal telecom concession, which allows it to provide telecom services without any
technological restrictions (e.g. fixed/wireless technologies, television and internet). An automatic twenty-year
renewal process is set forth in the concession agreement unless either party served three years’ notice of an
intention not to renew. Since neither party served such a notice, the renewal process under the concession began
automatically in August 2014. Altice Dominicana is also subject to Law No. 153-98 which provides for a renewal
process of the concession. On April 4, 2014 Indotel authorized Orange Dominicana, S. A. to transfer its social
control in favor of Altice Dominican Republic II, S.A.S. Further, on December 19, 2016 Indotel ordered the
registration of the change of business name of the concessionaire Orange Dominicana, S.A. to Altice Hispaniola,
S.A. Furthermore, on May 9, 2018, Indotel ordered the registration of the change of business name of the
concessionaire Altice Hispaniola, S. A. to Altice Dominicana, S. A. Also, on April 27, 2015, Altice Dominicana
presented a formal renewal request of its concession agreement to Indotel, and since Indotel has not expressly


-----

denied such request, the concession and all of its related authorizations and licenses have been renewed de facto
for 20 years effective from August 2015 pursuant to article 27.2 of Law 153-98. However, Indotel has not yet
provided a template of the proposed new concession agreements to be signed with local operators in similar
situation (concessions granted on or before Law 153-98).

The Constitution of the Dominican Republic guarantees freedom of enterprise, trade and industry among other
individual and social rights, in addition to the industry specific legal framework. The Constitution specifically sets
forth that monopolies shall not be permitted except in favor of the Dominican State and must be created by law.
The Dominican Constitution provides that the secrecy of telegraphic, telephonic, cable graphic, electronic,
telematics or established by another means of communication, shall not be breached, except by an order of a judge
or competent authority, in accordance with the law. Also, the Dominican Constitution guarantees public services
of radio, television, library and information networks, to allow universal access to information.

**_General Telecommunications Law 153-98_**

Law 153-98 classifies telecommunications services as follows:

a) Carrier services to provide the necessary capacity to transport signals between two points of termination
of a defined network;

b) Final services or teleservices to provide the complete capacity that makes communication possible among
users (e.g. telephone, telex, telegraphic);

c) Value added services to work as support carrier services, adding some characteristic or facility to the
service that is being used on the ground (e.g. internet/intranet systems, voice mail, SMS, electronic mail,
digital transmission of information in general);

d) Broadcasting services: telecommunication services in which the communication takes place normally
one way to various points of reception simultaneously (e.g. radio and television).

Law 153-98 provides a basic framework to regulate the installation, maintenance and operation of
telecommunications networks and the rendering of telecommunications services. Law 153-98 reaffirms the
“Universal Service Principle” by guaranteeing access to telecommunications services at affordable prices in lowincome rural and urban areas. Law 153-98 created the “Contribution to the Development of Telecommunications”
consisting of a 2% tax fund for the development of the telecommunications sector that is payable by customers
and collected by telecommunications providers from customers based on billings to customers for
telecommunications services.

According to Law 153-98, Indotel is the regulatory body created as a decentralized state entity, with operational,
jurisdictional and financial autonomy, with its own patrimony and legal personality, responsible for guaranteeing
the existence of sustainable, fair, and effective competition in the rendering of public telecommunications services
as well as ensuring the efficient use of the public domain of the radio electric spectrum.

Law 153-98 sets forth the responsibilities, authorities and procedures of the regulator. Indotel is made up of a
Board of Directors and an Executive Director. The Board of Directors is the highest authority of Indotel, composed
of five members designated by the Executive Power.

Among other management powers, Indotel administers the entrance and participation of the telecommunications
service providers in the Dominican telecommunications market, and has various functions including (i) granting,
expanding and revoking concessions and licenses under the conditions provided for by the laws in force, allowing
the entrance of new providers of telecommunications services; (ii) managing and administering the spectrum orbit
resources, including the management of the orbital portions of the telecommunications satellites with their
respective bands of frequencies, as well as the satellite orbits for Dominican satellites which may exist and
coordinating their use and operation with international entities and organisms and with other countries;
(iii) controlling the compliance with obligations of the concessionaires of public telecommunications services and
of the users of the radio electric spectrum, protecting the right of defense of the parties in its actions.

Law 153-98 promotes competition in all telecommunications services by enforcing the right to interconnect with
existing participants and ensuring against monopolistic practices, and at the same time upholding those
concessions that are operational. Law 153-98 provides that the regulator shall ensure charges are non

-----

discriminatory, strengthening effective and sustainable competition. In case of disagreement between the parties,
the regulator shall intervene by means of a motivated resolution, taking as parameters the costs, including a
reasonable remuneration for the investment, calculated according to the “Regulation of tariffs and costs of the
services”.

In accordance with Law 153-98 a concession granted by Indotel is required for providing public
Telecommunications services to third parties, with the exceptions set forth in Law 153-98. The authorization
process is governed by “Regulation for Telecommunication Services Authorizations” contained in Resolution
No. 036-19, issued by the Board of Directors of Indotel (“Resolution 036-19”).

Pursuant to Law 153-98 a license granted by Indotel shall be required for the use of the public radio electric
domain, with the exceptions set forth in the corresponding regulations. The authorization process is governed by
Resolution 036-19. When concessions and licenses are required for the rendering of a public telecommunications
service, they shall be granted simultaneously.

According to Law No. 153-98 the transfer, assignment, lease or granting of rights of use of any title or the creation
of a lien on licenses shall be performed, under penalty of forfeiture, prior to authorization of the regulating
authority, which authorization may not be denied without justified cause. The acquirer shall meet all the conditions
imposed on the grantor and shall be ruled by the same obligations as the concessionaire or licensee.

Law No. 153-98 constitutes the ratifying instrument of the Fourth Protocol attached to the General Agreement on
Commerce of Services (GATS) concerning negotiations on basic telecommunications of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), for liberalization of telecommunication services. Law No. 153-98 provides the
corresponding regulatory framework to comply with the liberalization commitments undertaken pursuant to said
agreement and to guarantee the efficient provision of telecommunications services.

Law 153-98 combined with technological advances and the sustained growth of private investment promotes the
development of the telecommunications sector in the Dominican Republic.

**_Certain Relevant Resolutions of Indotel_**

On the grounds of Law 153-98 Indotel issued various resolutions. Some of such resolutions regulating certain
areas of telecommunications in the Dominican Republic are as follows:

        - Resolution 110-12 dated August 9, 2012 by means of which Indotel’s Board of Directors
approved the General Regulation for Telephone Services amended by Indotel’s Board of
Directors Resolutions numbers 62-17 dated October 25, 2017, that approved the Regulation on
the Rights and Obligations of Users and Providers of Public Telecommunications Services and
003-13 of January 22, 2013, that approved the amendments to the General Regulation for
Telephone Services. The principal purpose of this regulation is to set forth a regulatory
framework governing relations between the public telephone service providers and their
customers and users, in all its forms (post-paid or pre-paid), regardless of the technology used
to provide the service, in order to guarantee the rights of each party explicitly maintaining their
respective obligations.

The abovementioned regulation sets forth basics rights of users, including: (i) access to telephone services in
terms of continuity, generality, equality, neutrality, transparency and quality, in accordance with the
principles of the Telecommunications General Law No. 153-98; (ii) their right to choose their service
provider; (iii) their right to have a phone number and numeric portability; (iv) their right to sign a contract in
accordance with terms, conditions and rights set forth in this regulation; (v) their right to cancel the service
in accordance with the procedure indicated in this regulation.

This regulation considers as “abusive clauses” those imposing conditions on users that affect their interests
and rights, and those that are disproportionate, or contrary to the laws, regulations and standards. According
to Article 14.2 of the General Regulation for Telephone Services approved by Indotel’s Board of Directors
Resolution 110-12 amended by Indotel’s Board of Directors Resolution No. 003-13, abusive clauses on
contracts will be unenforceable. Indotel shall require the amendment of abusive clauses such as to make them
conform to reasonable standards. If telecommunications service providers do not amend the contract, Indotel
may unilaterally enforce the amendment.


-----

        - Resolution No. 64-11 dated July 27, 2011, approved the bill of the National Frequency
Allocation Plan (PNAF) drafted by Indotel to be submitted to the Executive Power for its final
approval. Decree 520-11 dated August 25, 2011, issued by the Executive Power approved the
new PNAF and repealed Decree of the Executive Power No. 518-02 dated July 5, 2002. The
new PNAF approved by Decree 520-11 seeks to optimize and rationalize the use of the radio
electric spectrum to efficiently satisfy present and future frequency needs with regard to all
systems, equipment and devices that send or receive radio electric waves within the national
territory. According to the PNAF, migration of services shall not restrain the correct functioning
of services provided. Indotel is in charge of deciding, applying and resolving all matters arising
in connection with the frequencies allocation and migration. On January 23, 2019 Indotel’s
Board of Directors ordered the beginning of a public consultation process to amend the PNAF
approved by Decree 520-11 (Resolution No. 004-19).

        - Resolution No. 156-06 dated August 30, 2006, issued by the Board of Directors of Indotel, that
approves the General Regulation related to Numeric Portability, among other resolutions issued
by the Board of Directors of Indotel related to numeric portability. This Resolution was
modified by Indotel’s Board of Directors Resolutions numbers 065-08 of April 22, 2008, 01509 dated February 13, 2009, 015-15 dated July 8, 2015, 037-15 of December 9, 2015, issued by
the Board of Directors of Indotel.

        - Resolution No. 022-05 that approves Regulation on Free and Fair Competition for the
Telecommunications Sector provides that Indotel will review, authorize, object or condition the
operations related to economic concentration which must be previously informed pursuant to
said Regulation, in order to comply with the purposes of Law 153-98. Indotel will also
investigate and impose sanctions in the cases where the information obligation of the mentioned
operations is not complied with.

        - Resolution No. 022-05 defines economic concentration in the telecommunications sector as a
juridical transaction by means of which the structure of direct or indirect control, total or partial,
of one or more providers of public telecommunications services is modified permanently and
stably, for the benefit of persons that control other providers of public telecommunications
services, whenever such transaction has the potential to modify the structure and functioning of
the markets in the telecommunications sector in accordance with the purposes set forth in
article 3 of Law No. 153-98.

The providers of public telecommunications services, as well as any other persons subject to said Regulation must
previously inform Indotel of all those operations that could result in an economic concentration in the
telecommunications sector in the terms therein defined, in order to previously obtain the authorization of Indotel
to do so.

In addition to the obligations set forth in Resolution 036-19, relating to requirements for the authorization to
transfer the rights or permits, the assessment to determine if there is any economic concentration in the
telecommunications sector, will be based in its restrictive, predictable and verified effects, mainly considering
certain circumstances set forth in Resolution No. 022-05.

The failure to inform and/or apply for an authorization prior to an economic concentration operation in the
telecommunications sector constitutes an infringement of Resolution No. 022-05 that will result in the sanctions
set forth therein.

Application for an authorization related to economic concentration must be filed pursuant to the provisions set
forth in Chapter VIII of Resolution 036-19, before the Indotel and shall be reviewed by the Executive Direction
of such institution.

        - Resolution No. 089-17, amended by Resolution 005-19 dated February 7, 2019, that approves
the General Regulations for the Sharing of Passive Infrastructure and Related
Telecommunications Facilities.

        - Resolution No. 038-11 dated May 12, 2011 that amends the General Ruling concerning
Interconnection;


-----

        - Resolution No. 025-10 dated March 2, 2010, that approves the Ruling concerning Resolution of
Controversies between the Telecommunications Services Providers;

        - Resolution No. 160-05 dated October 13, 2005, that approves the Regulation concerning Cable
Broadcasts and Other Measures, including “Must Carry” provisions;

        - Resolution No. 151-04 that approves the Regulation concerning the Installation and Use of
Common Telecommunications Infrastructures in Properties of Joint Ownership;

        - Resolution No. 128-04 that approves the General Regulation concerning the Use of the Radio
Electric Spectrum;

        - Resolution No. 120-04 that approves the Regulation concerning Television Broadcasting
Service;

        - Resolution No. 093-02 dated November 14, 2002, that amends several Articles of Resolution
No. 045 02 that approved the Regulation concerning Sound Broadcasting Frequency
Modulation (FM); and,

        - Resolution No. 046-02 dated July 20, 2002, that approves the Regulation concerning Sound
Broadcasting Amplitude Modulation (AM).

**_Trademark/Copyright Laws_**

From a technical standpoint, broadcasting services are essentially regulated by Law 153-98 and the regulations
approved by the regulator. Now, in connection with the content of the broadcasting services, they shall be
governed by the provisions of the specific legislation which regulates the social communications media and by
the laws that regulate copyrights, whether they are national laws or resulting from international conventions or
agreements signed and ratified by the Dominican Republic.

In the Dominican Republic, patents of invention, trademarks, service marks, commercial names, signs, logos and
commercial slogans are governed by Industrial Property Law No. 20-00 dated May 8, 2000, modified by Law
No.424-06 for the Implementation of the Free Trade Agreement between the Dominican Republic, Central
America and the United States (DR CAFTA).

The Dominican Republic grants copyright protection to original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work,
under the Copyright Law No. 65-00 dated August 21, 2000, also modified by Law No.424-06 for the
implementation of the free trade agreement between the Dominican Republic, Central America and the United
States of America (DR CAFTA).

**Israel**

The communications and broadcasting industry in Israel is highly regulated and requires service providers to
obtain licenses from, and comply with the terms of such licenses and policy statements of, the Israeli Ministry of
Communications or the Council for Broadcasting by Cable and Satellite (the “Broadcasting Council”) with
respect to the various communications and broadcasting services, respectively, before offering them to the public.
The ever-changing regulatory environment can have a material effect on our activities. In this section only,
references to “we”, “us”, “our”, “HOT” and the “Company” may refer to HOT Telecommunication Systems Ltd,
HOT Telecom, HOT Mobile, HOT Net or, collectively, HOT Telecommunication Systems Ltd. and its
subsidiaries, as the context requires.

As a general matter, the regulatory principles are set forth in the laws enacted by the Israeli legislature (the
“Knesset”), primarily the Communications Law (Telecommunication and Broadcasting), 5742-1982 (the
“Communications Law”), as described below. These laws are amended from time to time upon enactment of the
Knesset. The laws authorize the Israeli Ministry of Communications (in some cases with the approval of the
Economic Affairs Committee of the Knesset) and the Broadcasting Council to issue regulations which provide for
specific requirements based upon the principles set forth in the laws. The Israeli Ministry of Communications
grants licenses in accordance with the Communications Laws and regulations. In addition to the regulations, the
Israeli Ministry of Communications issues policy statements after a public review and consultation process. These


-----

policy statements expand upon the Israeli Ministry of Communication’s policy with respect to certain basic issues
in the relevant market.

**Television**

**_Overview_**

Our television operations are subject to extensive legislative and regulatory requirements that apply to the
telecommunication industry in Israel, including the Communications Law, and the regulations enacted in
accordance with it. We are also subject to specific legislation applying to the television broadcasting industry in
Israel, such as the Harmful Broadcasts Classification, Marking and Prohibition of Damaging Broadcasts Law,
5761-2001 (which imposes certain classification and marking obligations with respect to television broadcasts)
and the Television Broadcasts Law (Sub Titles and Sign Language), 5765-2005 (which imposes certain
obligations regarding the accompaniment of television broadcasts with sub titles and translation into sign
language).

We provide our television services pursuant to a non-exclusive general cable broadcasting license issued by the
Broadcasting Council that applies to all areas of the State of Israel (the “Broadcasting Licenses”). The
Broadcasting Licenses contain certain conditions and restrictions relating to the provision of cable television
services to our customers, including among others, a requirement to extend our services to customers in all areas
of Israel which, in some cases, creates an obligation on us to provide services even though it would not be
worthwhile economically to do so. There are certain places in Israel in which we do not currently provide services.
In November 2014, the Israeli Ministry of Communications issued an order requiring us to provide services in
some of those areas. Such decision was postponed a few times in order to enable the Ministry of Communications
to examine changes in the market including technological developments. In July 2019, an Advisory Committee
recommended that HOT be allowed to extend its services by alternative technology without the need for laying
infrastructure. The Minister of Communications adopted these recommendations and HOT is currently offering
services in some of these areas using alternative technology. Our Broadcasting License was extended in May 2017
for a period of 10 years and is in effect until April 30, 2027. We also have a special license (held by HOT Telecom)
for operating a broadcasting hub which is valid until April 2023. As a general rule, the Broadcasting Licenses are
non-transferable. In addition, the transfer of any means of control in the relevant license holders may be subject
to prior approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications and the Broadcasting Council.

Our operations in the pay television segment are subject to the supervision of the Israeli Ministry of
Communications and the Broadcasting Council, including, among other things, in connection with broadcasting
content and launching of new channels or ceasing to broadcast existing channels. In addition, we have been
declared a monopoly in the area of multi-channel television broadcasts for subscribers, and accordingly, the
Competition Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) is permitted to issue instructions to us pursuant to the
Competition Law, 5748-1988. Accordingly, our ability to make acquisitions in the broadcasting sector will be
limited. The Commissioner has set various conditions which apply to us as part of its decision to approve the
Israeli cable consolidation. These conditions include, among others, separation of broadcasting and cable
infrastructure activities, limitations on possessing means of control and relationships with producers of the
channels, limitations on the purchase of, and the exclusivity in, programs and ownership of broadcast programs,
limitations on agreements with producers of channels, a requirement to provide telephony services, investing in
infrastructure, and the provision of bank guarantees. We are also subject to general antitrust law which prohibits
certain restrictive agreements and the abuse of dominant market positions. Certain key features of the regulations
and Broadcasting Licenses governing our television operations, including certain proposed regulatory changes
that may have a significant impact on our operations, are set forth below.

**_Obligation to Extend Services_**

Under the terms of the Broadcasting Licenses, we are required to extend our cable television services to customers
in all areas of Israel even where it would not be economically profitable to do so. Although we extend our services
to most of Israel, there are currently certain areas of the country where we do not. In November 2014, the Israeli
Ministry of Communications issued an order requiring us to provide services in some of these areas. Such decision
was postponed a few times, in order to enable the Ministry of Communications to examine changes in the market
including technological developments. As noted below, in July 2019 the Minister of Communication adopted the
advisory committee's decision enabling us to provide our services in areas without cable infrastructure using
alternative technologies and HOT is currently offering broadcasting packages in areas without cable infrastructure
over broadband infrastructure.


-----

**_Access to DTT Channels_**

The Second Authority for Television and Radio (the “Second Authority”), a statutory body set up under the
Second Television and Radio Authority Law (the “Second Authority Law”), is responsible for facilitating the
development of, and regulating, commercially operated television and radio broadcasts in Israel. Pursuant to an
amendment to the Second Authority Law, the Second Authority was charged with planning, establishing and
operating, itself or via others, digital broadcasting stations for the free reception and distribution of television
broadcasts (“DTT”) to the general public. Accordingly, in August 2009, the Second Authority launched
broadcasts on a nationwide basis, enabling the free distribution to the public of the following DTT channels: the
Israeli Broadcasting Authority channels (Channels 1 and 33), the commercial television channels (Channels 2 and
10), the Knesset Channel (Channel 99) and, recently, the Educational Channel (Channel 23). The establishment
of the digital broadcasting stations infrastructure enables subscribers to view the broadcasts of DTT channels free
of charge upon purchasing a set-top box. We are also required to carry the DTT channels over our network.

In accordance with the Digital Broadcast Station Distribution Channels Law, 5762-2012 (the “Broadcast
**Distribution Law”), as amended in 2013, the Council shall be entitled to grant a license for the broadcast of a**
subject-oriented channel within the framework of the DTT broadcasts to a body selected in a tender. In accordance
with the amendment to the Broadcast Distribution Law, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of
Communications shall be able to appoint, via tender, a private operating body who will operate the digital landbased broadcasting array (the “Array”) and use it to transmit broadcasts (the “Operating Body”). It was also
decided, that the Operating Body would receive, in addition to the permit to operate digital broadcasting stations,
a unique license from the Council to broadcast on the Array in such a manner that will allow it both to operate the
Array and to transmit additional channels, which will be financed by subscription fees or by commercials.
Directives were also established on the matter of payments that a theme channel producer (as defined below) and
a designated channel producer need to pay the license holder for the broadcasts.

As part of the amendment, it was decided that when a holder of a general license for broadcasting over the Array
reaches an extensive scope of activity, as defined in the Broadcasting Distribution Law, the Council shall be
entitled to issue a special license to broadcast one channel on the Array, through the general license holder, in
accordance with the terms set in the license (a theme channel).

**_Narrow Package Proposal_**

According to the Broadcasting Council’s resolutions in September 27, 2012, we begun offering a narrow package
to our consumers, featuring a limited number of channels, in return for reduced subscription fees compared to the
Company’s basic package. On February 20, 2014, the Broadcasting Council published its position, which
recommended making it obligatory to offer subscribers a basic package. Following this position, the Minister of
Communications published a ruling instructing HOT and Yes to offer our subscribers a basic package at a price
not exceeding 120 NIS per month. This decision was extended to February 23, 2018 under the same terms.

On March 27, 2019 the Broadcasting Council decided not to extend the decision obligating HOT and Yes to offer
a narrow package as described above. At the same time, it approved Hot’s and Yes’ offering of channel packages
that are smaller than the basic packages at a reduced prices comparing the broader packages offered. The approval
expired in March 2020.

**_Ownership of Television Channels_**

We are subject to regulatory limitations in connection with the ownership and production of television channels,
including the rules set forth in the Communications Rules (Telecommunication and Broadcasting) (Broadcasting
Licensees), 5748-1987 (“Communications Rules”). Pursuant to the provisions of the Communications Rules we
are subject to restrictions regarding the number of channels that we can produce ourselves or in collaboration with
another broadcasting license holder, such that the number of such television channels does not exceed two fifths
of the number of independent channels that we broadcast on our network. However, we are subject to more
restrictive ownership rules pursuant to the decision of the Broadcasting Council approving the Israeli cable
companies merger in 2006. Accordingly, the number of channels that we can produce, including channels
produced by our predecessor companies at the date of approval, must not exceed 20% of the independent channels
that we broadcast. In addition to those channels, we are also permitted to hold controlling interests in additional
channels so long as the number of such channels does not exceed 4% of the total independent channels that we
broadcast and we are not the controlling shareholder of such independent channels.


-----

We are also subject to the decision of the Commissioner approving the cable merger in 2006, pursuant to which
we are only permitted to hold means of control in the HOT 3 Channel and the HOT Movies Channel (previously
Channels 3 and 4) and four additional channels which were not broadcasted in the cable infrastructure as of
January 2005, or a similar channel to these channels, unless we obtain prior approval of the Commissioner.

On September 5, 2018 the Commissioner amended the conditions of the cable merger to implement certain
amendments to the merger approval terms. In the scope of the decision, certain amendments were introduced,
specifically with respect to the purchase of content and ownership of channels.

**_Minimum Investment in Local Content Productions_**

In accordance with the Communications Law, the Communications Rules and decisions of the Broadcasting
Council, we are required to invest at least 8% of our annual television revenues from subscriber fees in local
productions to be broadcast for the first time over our network.

In accordance with the Communications Law, the communications rules and Council’s rulings, the rate of the
Company’s investment in local productions in 2017 remained 8% of its annual revenues from subscriber fees,
paid for television broadcasts. The Broadcasting Council’s December 2017 resolution stated that in 2018 the
investment rate will remain 8% of our annual revenues, and increase to 9% starting 2019. According to the
Broadcasting Council’s decisions on December 13, 2018 and November 28, 2019, the investment rate for 2019
and 2020 will also remain 8%, and the rate for 2021 will be 9%, subject to certain terms and subject to further
review by the Broadcasting Council during 2020, if needed, according to the developments in the market.

On September 5, 2018 the Commissioner amended the conditions of the cable merger to allow HOT to own also
channels that broadcast only foreign content. The conditions prohibiting HOT to own channels that broadcast
sports and local original content remain intact.

**_Special Licenses for Cable Broadcasts_**

Under the Communications Law, the Broadcasting Council is permitted to grant special licenses for cable
broadcasts with a view to increasing the number of competitors involved in the broadcasting industry. In such
cases, the general broadcasting licensees will be required to transmit the special licensee’s broadcasts over their
networks subject to the condition that the capacity available to the general broadcasting licensee will not fall below
five sixths of the total capacity available over its network. In August 2007, the Israeli Minister of Communications
determined the minimum carriage fee to be paid by a special licensee for distribution of its channel by a general
cable broadcasting licensee. We are also required to maintain a minimum level of capacity for transmitting special
licensee broadcasts pursuant to the conditions established for approving the Israeli cable consolidation. In addition,
in accordance with the Communications Law, the Broadcasting Council is permitted to grant special licenses to
the broadcasters of designated channels. Unlike other special licensees, the designated channel licensees are not
obliged to pay a carriage fee to the general broadcasting licensee although the parties are free to agree to such
consideration contractually.

**_Prohibition of Termination Fees_**

In 2011, the Communications Law was amended to prohibit a license holder from collecting an exit or termination
fee from residential and business subscribers whose monthly bill is under NIS 5,000 who terminate their
agreement with the license holder before the end of the minimum term of such agreement. While a license holder
is permitted to collect the balance of the payment in respect of end user equipment purchased by the subscriber
and debts accumulated by the subscriber, if payment for end user equipment is due in instalments, the license
holder is not permitted to demand immediate repayment of the entire balance.

In addition, pursuant to a decision of the Broadcasting Council in 2011, we are permitted to collect payments from
new subscribers only in respect of services provided in the past month and cannot collect payment for service in
advance. This decision has had an impact on our cash flows as we transition customers to a post-services billing
basis.


-----

**_Prohibition on Advertising_**

The Communications Law prohibits broadcasting licensees from including commercials in their broadcasts other
than promotional advertisements for upcoming broadcasts. Commercial channels, including certain “must carry”
channels, and foreign channels may be permitted to include commercials on their channels.

**_Proposed Changes in the Regulation of Audio-visual Content_**

In July 2018, a bill for the amendment of the Communication Law (Telecommunications and Broadcasting)
(Regulation of Content Providers) was published (the “Bill”). According to the Bill, the purpose of the amendment
is to change the regulation of the multi-channel TV market and adapt it to the technological changes, so that the
regulation will apply to audio-visual content suppliers which carry contents to the public in Israel, as of a certain
scope of income, while encouraging the competition and reducing the regulatory burden. According to the Bill, it
is proposed that the regulation will apply on content providers under the principal of technological neutrality, i.e.
it shall also apply with respect to content providers which carry their broadcasts over the internet, provided that
such broadcasts are aimed primarily to the Israeli pubic. In addition, it is proposed to apply the regulation in a
gradual manner, so that it will only apply to providers with a certain scope of activity. In addition, in order to
unify the regulatory rules applicable to all license holders, it is proposed to cancel the cable broadcasting license
and the satellite broadcasting license and the different regulation in this respect. Instead of that, it is proposed that
any audio-visual content provider that meets the proposed conditions, regardless of the technology, will operate
according to an audio-visual content license according to a unified regulatory framework. It is also proposed to
update and adapt the Broadcasting Council’s authorities in a way that will reduce its authorities and focus them
on subjects like broadcasting ethics, child protections and local production investments. It is further proposed to
enable the license holders to offer their subscribers broadcasting packages upon their discretion, provided,
however, that every channel will be also offered for purchase separately and not as part of a package. However,
until the competition is established, it is proposed to maintain the existing regulation with respect to a narrow
basic package and to authorize the Broadcasting Council to instruct a license holder to include in the basic package
contents produced or purchased by it, in a rate that will be determined by the Council which shall not increase
20%.

On October 7, 2020, a committee appointed by the Minister of Communications for the purpose of reviewing the
macro-regulation in the broadcasting market published a public hearing regarding the future regulation in the
broadcasting market in Israel. The main issues that the committee will review include reducing and focusing the
regulation, local productions, the structure of the regulatory bodies, economic models in the broadcasting market,
regulation of sports broadcasting and ratings measurement. As of the date hereof, the committee has not published
its recommendations.

**Broadband Internet Infrastructure Access and Fixed Line Telephony**

**_Overview_**

Our broadband internet infrastructure access and fixed line telephony operations are subject to extensive
legislative and regulatory requirements that apply to the telecommunications industry in Israel, including the
Communications Law, and the regulations enacted in accordance with it. Our operations are subject to the
supervision of the Israeli Ministry of Communications (the “Ministry”).

We provide our broadband internet infrastructure access, fixed line telephony services and certain other
communication services pursuant to a general domestic operator license for the provision of fixed line services in
Israel and a general license for provision of telecom services in several towns in Judea and Samaria (the “Fixed
**Line Licenses”). Among other things, the Fixed Line Licenses prohibit disconnection of any subscriber from the**
services other than in certain specified cases listed in therein. Our Fixed Line Licenses are valid until 2023 and
may be extended for periods of 10 years at a time upon approval by the Ministry. As a general rule, these Licenses
are non-transferable. In addition, the transfer of means of control in the relevant license holders may be subject to
prior approval of the Ministry.

Certain key features of the regulations and licenses governing our broadband internet infrastructure access and
fixed line telephony operations, including certain proposed regulatory changes that may have a significant impact
on our operations, are set forth below.

**_Decision Regarding the Creation of a Wholesale Market_**

In accordance with the recommendations of a professional committee (the Hayek Committee) adopted by the
Minister of Communications, on January 15, 2014 the Ministry of Communications published its decision on the
list of wholesale services, that infrastructure owners (HOT and Bezeq) would be required to offer the service
providers. Regarding some of the services, after hearing proceedings, service files were established regarding the
service provision format. Also attached to the decision were regulations on maximum service rates on the Bezeq
network. On June 15, 2017 HOT received the Minister of Communication’s decision to adopt the
recommendations of the Ministry’s professional echelon on setting maximum rates for providing wholesale
services on the HOT network for 2017-2018. In November 2018, the Ministry of Communications extended the
maximum rates until 2020. In July 2019, the Ministry of Communications published a new proposal for setting
the maximum rates for providing wholesale services.

The decision also noted that the recommendations of the Ministry’s Engineering Department would be adopted,
and that the Minister would instruct HOT to perform the required tests in order to test the required inputs needed
to provide the multicast service, and that a directive on the test details, completed within 4 months of the
instruction, shall be published in the near future. HOT currently provides wholesale services in accordance with
the Minister’s decision to service providers.

On December 30, 2019, the Ministry of Communications published a hearing proposing to change the method for
the wholesale tariffs in HOT’s network from cost-based model to a “retail-minus” basis. In the scope of the
Ministry’s decision in June 2020, to allow HOT to offer bundles including HOT Net’s ISP services, the Ministry
also decided that HOT will provide its wholesale services in consideration for decreased fees which were
voluntarily proposed by HOT, and therefore the Ministry did not proceed with the change of tariffs as proposed
in the hearing.

_Use of Passive Infrastructure_

On February 26, 2015, the Ministry of Communications published a resolution on the service file for access
service to physical infrastructure, according to which the infrastructure owners (Bezeq and HOT) must allow
service providers to use the passive infrastructure of the infrastructure owners (stems, dens, boxes and poles)
starting August 1, 2015. Following this, pursuant to the 2017-2018 Arrangements Law, Section 5 of the
Communications Law was amended, in such a manner so as to compel domestic operators to allow other domestic
operators to use their passive infrastructure in such a manner so as to allow the other domestic operator to deploy
cables or optical fibers through it or establish telecom facilities, in such a manner so as to allow the maintenance
of the cables and facilities in question, in order to perform any telecom activity and provide any telecom service
in accordance with the terms of the other domestic operator’s license (“Mutual Arrangement”). It was also
decided that the Minister of Communications, with the consent of the Minister of Finance, shall set the maximum
or minimum tariffs for the use of the passive Bezeq infrastructure by a domestic operator who does not hold a
unique general license (currently HOT and IBC Israel). In January 2019, the Ministry of Communications
published draft regulations. Until these regulations are passed, the maximum payment set for access to passive
infrastructure in the Communications Regulations (Telecom and Broadcasts) (Use of Domestic Operator Public
Telecom Network), 5765-2014 (the “Telecom and Broadcasts Communications Regulations”), prior to the
application of the Arrangements Law shall apply. If a difference exists between the payments paid by HOT for
the use of the passive infrastructure in question, and the payments set by the Minister, retroactive accounting shall
take place as the case may be. It was also decided that HOT’s right to use the passive infrastructure of a different
domestic operator would be postponed to October 1, 2017. According to draft regulations published by the
Ministry of Communications on August 13, 2018, the Ministry considers to order that the rates for the use of
Bezeq’s passive infrastructures by HOT will be the same as the rates set for the use by other license holders.

**_Implementation of Universal Service Obligations and Deployment of Fixed Lines_**

Similar to the Broadcasting Licenses, the Fixed Line Licenses contain a requirement to extend our services to
customers in all areas of Israel even where it would not be economically profitable to do so. Although we extend
our services to most of Israel, there are currently certain areas of the country where we do not provide these
services and we had applied for exemptions from the terms of the Fixed Line Licenses. Pursuant to the Fixed Line
Licenses we are also required to provide network access service to other license holders on reasonable commercial
terms so as to enable them to provide services to their subscribers and we must also avoid preferential provision
of network access to our affiliated companies, including with regard to payment terms and service availability.


-----

On June 22, 2014, a report (the “Report”) was submitted to the Minister, by an Advisory Committee to the
Minister in accordance with the Communication Regulations (Telecommunications and Broadcasts) (Advisory
Committee), 5761-2011 (respectively, the “Committee” and “Regulations”) recommending the considerations
that should be applied in relation to applications submitted by Bezeq and HOT for exemption or deferral of the
obligation to extend service. Among other things, the Committee recommended that there should be no
justification to delay or limit the provision of telecommunications services in any area nationwide on the basis of
cost-benefit considerations. The Report concludes that cost-benefit considerations should be taken into account
only for applications to specifically restrict or deny the provision of communications services to specific customers
(an “Individual Application”), rather than for a specific area or number of requests from the same area (a
“General Request”).

The Committee also recommended that limitations on the provision of communication services through
exemptions or deferrals should, as a rule, be done only temporarily and recommended a temporary exemption for
a fixed period of 24 months. It also recommended license holders must report any change in the circumstances
surrounding an application for which an exemption was approved, and if the circumstances upon which the
exemption was based no longer exist the universal obligation upon the licensee will apply immediately and
without delay. In addition, the Committee recommended certain timelines for the implementation of the universal
service obligation in case of rejection of an application for exemption or deferral.

The Committee further recommended the rejection of all existing applications made by HOT, except with regard
to one specific application relating to a particular settlement for which it suggests a deferral for a period of
24 months, subject to the provision of an alternative solution by HOT.

On November 13, 2014, the Minister of Communications published his decision to adopt the recommendations of
the Committee. As part of that decision, the Minister accepted the Committee’s recommendations with respect to
the rejection of all existing applications for deferral and/or exemption made by HOT (subject to the exception
noted above). As a result, HOT is required to implement its universal service obligations with respect to the first
stage of the deployment, in 60 local jurisdictions determined by the Minister, within 24 months from the date of
the adoption of the Committee’s recommendations (November 13, 2016). As noted above, the prescribed pace of
implementation of the obligations will be reviewed annually, taking into account any technological and regulatory
changes. It was further decided that the Committee shall submit to the Minister of Communications a list of
recommended local jurisdictions for the next deployment stage, if required in accordance with the then-available
technological alternatives.

The implementation of the decision that required HOT to complete deployment of its network by November 13,
2016, was postponed several times by the Minister of Telecommunications until July 30, 2019. In July 2019, an
Advisory Committee recommended that HOT would be allowed to extend its services by alternative technology
without the need for laying infrastructure. The Minister of Communications adopted these recommendations and
HOT is currently providing services in some of these areas using alternative technology.

**_Fiber Optic Networks Deployment_**

On December 18, 2018, the Ministry of Communications published a call for public comments with respect to the
principles for deployment of ultra-wide bandwidth infrastructure in Israel setting out the basis for the policy under
consideration at the Ministry which, according to it, is intended to supplement the existing system of incentives
and create regulatory certainty for the communications companies in terms of regulation. In the call for public
comments, the Ministry presents initial principles according to which it is considering formulating regulation
aimed at providing a solution for the different issues, mainly:

1. Freedom of action for infrastructure owners and service providers in terms of the technology mix, subject
to the principle of non-infringement of the services that a competitor can offer.

2. Provision of wholesale services by the infrastructure owner as set out in the service portfolios, with any
technological advancement in parallel to provision thereof in the existing networks.

3. A reasonable wholesale payment for BSA services, in accordance with Section 17 of the
Communications Law, under the following restrictions:

(a) A cost based tariff and not retail minus.


-----

(b) A uniform flat monthly tariff without a variable capacity allocation component.

(c) The option of speed-based differential pricing will be weighed.

(d) The existence of an effective margin squeeze prevention mechanism.

(e) Quick implementation—the Ministry is considering, until completion of the up-to-date study of
costs, to set the controlled price for fiber-based wholesale services, based on the data currently
in its possession. It was indicated that a specific hearing on the subject would be published
further to the call for public comments.

4. Formulation of an incentive mechanism for operation of advanced networks

(a) The universal service obligation will not apply to HOT in respect of advanced fiber-based
networks.

(b) Bezeq and HOT will be given flexibility to establish a plan for operation of the network on a
regional level (cities/neighborhoods). The regions in which the infrastructure owner intends to
operate a fiber network will be published for the service providers several months in advance.
In case of barriers to implementation of use of this service, the Ministry will act to remove them.

On February 10, 2019 an inter-ministerial team was established to review the policy for deployment of ultra-wide
bandwidth fixed communication infrastructure in Israel that includes representatives from the Ministry of
Communications, Ministry of Finance and the Competition Authority. The team was requested to review and
formulate recommendations on the following subjects with attention to the good of the public and development
of competition in the segment, all with respect to fixed ultra-wide bandwidth infrastructure: (i) Revision of the
deployment obligations and/or obligations to provide the service applicable to the infrastructure owners and
(ii) the need for tools to encourage deployment in regions in which it recommends stipulating that there is no
deployment obligation, based on economic feasibility studies.

On November 5, 2019, the team published its recommendations for the next deployment stage to public's
comments. The principal recommendations of the team are as follows: (i) Bezeq will be entitled to choose the
areas for the deployment of optical fibers network, in which it will be obligated to complete its deployment within
five years; (ii) in order to finance the deployment of fiber-optic networks in the areas that Bezeq will decide not
to do so (the “Incentivisation Areas”), a fund will be established to provide financial incentives for fibers
deployment to the residents in those areas (the “Universal Fund”), which will allocate its funds by way of
competitive procedures with minimum governmental intervention. The winning proposals in such procedures will
be the lowest ones; (iii) the Universal Fund will be financed by annual payments of all license holders (including
Bezeq) in the amount of 0.5% of their annual income; and (iv) in order to motivate Bezeq to commit to a broad
deployment, to limit the Incentivisation Areas, to decrease the deployment costs in such areas and to create a high
level of competition in them, the team recommends: (a) to limit Bezeq’s deployment in the Incentivisation Areas,
(b) to exclude Bezeq from participating in the bidding process for the allocation of the Universal Fund sources;
(c) that the cost for the use of Bezeq’s physical infrastructures by other operators will be based on a different
method, significantly lower than the payments in accordance with the wholesale market regulation; (d) the
winning bidder(s) in a specific area will be obligated to provide wholesale BSA services in this area to other
license holders.

The team mentioned in its recommendation, that the examination of HOT’s deployment obligation should be
further explored in the scope of another opinion, in accordance with the developments in HOT’s network and in
order to adapt its deployment obligation to the advantages of its network and to the scope of deployment of its
passive network.

Following the call for public comments and the appointment of the inter-ministerial team, the Ministry of
Communications published several additional hearings regarding various subjects related to the policy and
regulation of deployment of advanced networks in Israel. Following these procedures, on July 20, 2020, the
Minister of Communications decided to adopt the recommendations of the inter-ministerial team regarding the
deployment obligations that will apply to the infrastructure owners, subject to several changes. In this scope, it
was decided that Bezeq will be entitled to choose the areas for deployment and operation of its advanced network
within five years, according to timelines which will be set in Bezeq’s license. In the event that HOT decides to
deploy an advanced network, it will be obligated to deploy at least 30% and to meet a 1:1 proportion rate between


-----

the center and peripheral areas. Bezeq also notified the Ministry of certain areas in which it will not deploy any
network (the “Incentive Areas”). In order to promote the deployment in the Incentive Areas, a fund will be
founded that will grant financial incentives for the deployment of competitive procedures (the “Fund”) and Bezeq
will not be entitled to participate in such procedures. The financing of the Fund will be done through annual
payments by the license holders (including Bezeq) which have an infrastructure or a marketing relation (as such
terms are defined in the report) in an amount equal to 0.5% of their respective annual income. The payments to
the Fund will begin in 2021 based on the annual incomes of 2020. It was further decided that the cost for the use
of Bezeq’s physical infrastructures in the Incentive Areas will be significantly lower than the wholesale market
tariffs and that the front-runners of the competitive procedures will be obligated to provide wholesale services
(BSA) in the Incentive Areas to other license holders.

In September 2020, the Israeli government approved the fiber optic program and following that, in December
2020, the Communication Law was amended in order to implement the decisions of the MOC and the government
regarding the policy for deployment in accordance with the principals described above, subject to several changes.
It was decided that Bezeq will be obligated to complete the deployment in the areas chosen by it within six years
and that it shall notify the Ministry of Communications within five months from January 1, 2020 (which may be
extended by up to two months) regarding the areas for deployment. The Ministry of Communications’ General
Director will notify the license holders that are required to make payments towards the Fund, the amount owed
by them for the applicable year by July 1 of each year. In the first year, however, such notice may be delayed.

**_Hearing regarding “margin squeeze”_**

Following the hearing published by the Ministry of Communications on setting a format for examining the
limitation of margins by land-based broadband communications infrastructure owners, on August 29, 2017 HOT
received a secondary hearing for determining a format for examining margin squeeze, published by the Ministry
of Communications following references received from license holders. The hearing and the secondary hearing
are intended to arrange the examination on whether owners of nationally-deployed infrastructure (Bezeq and HOT)
are using margin squeeze practices in order to push service providers lacking national land-based infrastructure
out of the market. This by lowering retail process and reducing the margin between the retail prices of an
infrastructure owner and the retail price of the infrastructure input purchased by service providers. To this date,
no decision has been made by the Ministry with respect to the subject matter.

**_Removal of Certain Restrictions on Bezeq_**

In May 2010, the Ministry of Communications announced that it was amending Bezeq’s license and those of its
subsidiaries, regarding the possibility of marketing joint product packages, in accordance with the terms set in the
licenses, including the Ministry of Communications’ approval for marketing packages. To the best of our
knowledge, Bezeq marketed several communication packages. According to publications, in 2018 Bezeq’s
subsidiaries – Bezeq International, Yes and Pelephone – strengthened their synergies and announced that they
would be cooperating, including by offering joint service packages. In June 2018, a dedicated team was appointed
in the Ministry of Communications to review the need to update the structural separation obligations of Bezeq
and HOT. In February 2019, Bezeq filed a petition to the High Court of Justice demanding to cancel the structural
separation between it and its subsidiaries. On June 30, 2020, the inter-division team appointed by the Ministry of
Communications in June 2018 for the purpose of review of the need to update the structural separation in Bezeq
and HOT, published its recommendations. The team recommended that the structural separation should not be
canceled, however, the Minister of Communications will later examine the need to change the separation between
internet infrastructure service and ISP service. Following that, in October 2020, the Ministry of Communications
published a hearing proposing to amend Bezeq and HOT’s licenses so that as of January 1, 2022 they will be
entitled to provide their customers a unified internet service. In February 2021, the Ministry of Communications
published a secondary hearing in this matter, proposing certain changes to the previous hearing. As of the date
hereof, no decision has been made in this hearing. In addition, in April 2021, the Competition Authority decided
to amend the conditions for the merger of Bezeq and Yes in a way that enables Bezeq’s subsidiary to provide
subsidized triple-play packages.

**_Israel Electric Company Infrastructure_**

Following the government resolution, in June 2013 a group of investors was selected for the establishment of a
Communications Venture, which is a new infrastructure company, headed by Via Europe, which holds 60% of
the venture, along with the Israeli Electric Company, which holds 40% of the venture. On August 27, 2013, the


-----

Minister of Communications issued a general license for the provision of domestic land-based telecom services
(infrastructure) to IBC Israel.

In August 2018, the Minister of Communications decided to amend the regulatory framework for the operation of
IBC Israel, in a way that shall enable the reduction of its universal deployment obligation. Following that, it was
decided that the new license that will be granted to IBC Israel will include a deployment obligation for 40% of
the households in Israel within 10 years. In addition, it was decided that the Minister may allow a domestic fixedline operator (except Bezeq or HOT) to be the control owner in IBC Israel, if he was convinced that this would
not affect the competition or the public interest. In March 2019, Cellcom signed an agreement to purchase
(together with Israel Infrastructure Fund (“IIF”)) 70% of the share capital of IBC Israel and in August 2019 the
Minister of Communications granted a new license to IBC Israel. Following the Ministry of Communications’
approval, it was reported that such transaction was completed in July 2019.

In September 2020, HOT entered into an investment agreement with the partnership holding 70% share capital of
IBC Israel, so that after the completion of the transaction HOT holds the partnership together with Cellcom and
IIF and holds approximately 23.3% of IBC Israel. HOT also entered into an agreement for the purchase of
indefeasible rights of use (IRU) in infrastructure lines in IBC Israel, according to certain committed percentage
increasing gradually, of the customers houses connected to IBC Israel’s network. In February 2021, following the
receipt of all the required regulatory approvals from the Minister of Communications and the Competition
Authority, the transaction was completed. The Minister of Communications’ approval was subject to several
conditions, including the following: (i) IBC Israel will enable any license holder interested to engage with it a
shelf offer including various alternatives for a discount; (ii) IBC Israel will deploy its network so that after five
years from March 7, 2021, 1.7 million households in Israel will be accessible to the network and as of the end of
the third year following the grant of the license (July 31, 2019) and until reaching accessibility to 1.3 million
households, the network deployment will be done in a 1:1 proportion rate between the center and peripheral areas
as defined in IBC Israel’s license. HOT’s license was also amended to enable it to provide internet and landline
telephony services over IBC Israel’s fiber infrastructure. Following the required approvals, HOT began to provide
its services over IBC Israel’s optic fiber network including internet, land-line telephony and television.

**_Telephony Services over Broadband Internet_**

In 2007, the Israeli Ministry of Communications published the licensing policy for the provision of telephony
services via broadband internet infrastructure or Voice Over Broadband. The policy stipulated that the provision
of Voice Over Broadband services will be regulated via general specific licenses to be granted pursuant to the
provisions of the Communications Regulations (Telecommunications and Broadcasting) (Processes and
Conditions for Receipt of a General Specific License), 5764-2004. A general specific licensee will be permitted
to provide telephony services using VoIP or VOB technology via the broadband internet infrastructure access
service of a general fixed line licensee (currently only us and Bezeq). This policy thus permits a general specific
licensee to provide services using a broadband licensee’s network without the requirement to pay the owner of
the network infrastructure charge, although they still must pay interconnection fees, whilst competing with it in
providing fixed line telephony services.

**Internet Service Provider**

We provide our ISP services through our subsidiary, HOT Net, pursuant to a special license to provide internet
access services (the “ISP License”). The ISP license permits us to provide various services, including internet
access services, email services, installation and maintenance of a network for transmission of data, documents and
electronic messages (EDI), processing, management and routing of messages and system administration services
(including monitoring and handling malfunctions, information security, information systems and information
compression and securing access to service recipient’s computer). Under the terms of the ISP License, we are
required to provide ISP services to any customer or other ISP license holders, including to customers of other
broadband internet infrastructure access providers, without discrimination and under identical terms and
conditions. Our ISP License is valid until December 31, 2015, and may be extended upon approval by the Ministry.
As a general rule, the transfer of any means of control in a relevant license holder is subject to prior approval of
the Ministry. On October 31, 2012, the Ministry published an amendment applicable to all licenses issued to ISP
providers including our ISP License. The amendment introduced certain provisions mainly relating to consumer
protection. On January 5, 2016, Hot Net’s license was extended to December 31, 2020. As of January 2021, the
provision of ISP services by HOT Net was incorporated into the Unified General License granted to HOT Net
which is effective for 20 years as of May 12, 2012.

**Mobile**

Our mobile operations are subject to the Communications Law, the Telegraphy Ordinance New Version, 57321972, and the regulations enacted in accordance with them. We are also subject to the Planning and Construction
Act and regulations with regard to site construction, the Consumer Protection Law, 5741-1981, the Non Ionising
Radiation Law, 5766-2006, and the Law for the Prevention of Environmental Hazards (Civil Claims), 5752-1992,
which enables class action claims in cases of radiation contamination. We provide our mobile services pursuant
to a non exclusive license to erect, maintain and operate a mobile system and to provide mobile services (the
“Mobile License”). The Mobile License was amended in September 2011 to add additional frequencies in relation
to the creation of a UMTS network. The Mobile License with respect to the main original frequencies which we
use to deliver our iDEN-based mobile services is valid until February 2016. Over the course of 2016 HOT Mobile
has launched a new service, “MIRS4G”, based on POC technology (PTT over cellular) on its network, to replace
the service the Company had provided on the iDEN network. The Mobile License with respect to the additional
frequencies which we will utilize to provide UMTS-based mobile services is valid until September 2031. The
Mobile License may be extended for periods of six years at a time upon approval by the Israeli Ministry of
Communications. As a general rule, the Mobile License is non transferable, and the transfer of any means of
control in a relevant license holder is subject to prior approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications.

Certain key features of the regulations and licenses governing our mobile operations, including certain proposed
regulatory changes that may have a significant impact on our operations, are set forth below.

On July 2, 2014, the Israeli Ministry of Communications published a tender for a mobile phone license for the
provision of advanced services using 4G-LTE technology, through which a total of eight frequency bands in the
area of 1,800 MHz will be allocated (with a width of 5 MHz). On November 18, 2014, HOT Mobile submitted its
offer in response to the tender.

The draft tender clarified that a licensee may enter into a network sharing agreement with another licensee subject
to certain conditions. As a result, HOT Mobile has updated its request for approval by the Israeli Ministry of
Communications of the Joint Network Agreement with Partner accordingly.

In connection with this tender process, the Israeli Ministry of Communications announced its decision to allow
all existing mobile operators wishing to upgrade their systems immediately to use the frequency bandwidth of 5
MHz (X2) in the area of 1,800 MHz LTE technology. If the operator does not currently have such an allocation,
the Israeli Ministry of Communications will assign them a temporary frequency bandwidth to use LTE technology
until the end of the tender proceedings. However, companies will be required to avoid discrimination between
operators that are being hosted on their networks, such as virtual operators or operators with domestic roaming
agreements, in terms of the level of technology offered to their subscribers. In addition, companies will not be
able to discriminate between subscribers with regards to the price of services, and will not be able to charge an
additional cost for these 4G services, until such time as the launch of LTE after the publication of the tender
winners and receiving their revised frequencies license. Companies may also not raise fares in light of this upgrade
to customers, virtual operators or users of domestic roaming. During July and August 2014, Partner
Communications Ltd., Cellcom Israel Ltd. and Pelephone Communications Ltd., announced the launch of LTE.
HOT Mobile intends to launch such services in the coming months. The outcome of the 4G-LTE tender process
was announced during 2015.

In July 2018, the Ministry of Communications temporarily allocated two bands, each of 5 MHz, in the 700 MHz
spectrum, to HOT Mobile and Partner. According to the announcement by the Ministry on May 17, 2018, these
temporary allocations were intended to enable technological preparations for providing advanced services and for
efficient assimilation of the relevant technologies via this frequency. In view of the network sharing agreement
between HOT Mobile and Partner, it was decided that Partner will also be allowed to use the frequencies allocated
to HOT Mobile using the shared network (see below). In June 2019, the Ministry of Communications published
a tender for 5G frequencies, which defers the first payment on the bands until 2022, in order to enable the
companies to direct their financial resources to investments during first two years. The temporary allocation will
be canceled based on the results of the tender. In accordance with the tender conditions, HOT Mobile and Partner
submitted a joint proposal and won, each, the following frequencies: 10 MHz in the 700 MHz frequency range,
20 MHz in the 2,600 MHz frequency range and 50 MHz in the 3,500 MHz frequency range. The frequencies were
allocated to HOT Mobile in September 9, 2020, and in that day HOT Mobile also received an amended license
allowing it to operate a 5G network. Upon the receipt of the amended license and the frequencies allocation, HOT
Mobile began to operate a 5G network.


-----

**_Network Sharing_**

On April 20, 2015, the Ministry of Communications approved the network sharing agreement between HOT
Mobile and Partner in accordance with Ministry policy and the relevant licenses. On August 9, 2015, the Ministry
of Communications granted PHI (the general partner in the joint venture) a special license to provide cellular radio
infrastructure services to a radio telephone operator, pursuant to which the joint venture, among other things, is
responsible for maintaining, developing and operating an advanced radio network for HOT Mobile and Partner
and the joint venture began operating. The license shall be in effect for a period of 10 years.

**_Construction of Network Sites_**

The regulation of network site construction and operation are primarily set forth in the Israeli National Zoning
Plan 36A for Communications which was published in May 2002 (“National Zoning Plan 36”). The construction
of radio access devices, which are cell sites of smaller dimensions, is further regulated in the Planning and Building
Law and the Communications Law.

_National Zoning Plan 36A_

National Zoning Plan 36A (the “Plan”) includes guidelines for constructing cell sites in order to provide mobile
broadcasting and reception communications coverage throughout Israel, while preventing radiation hazards and
minimizing damage to the environment and landscape. Plan sets forth the considerations that the planning and
building authorities should take into account when issuing building permits for cell sites. These considerations
include the satisfaction of safety standards meant to protect the public’s health from non-ionizing radiation
emitting from cell sites, minimizing damage to the landscape and examining the effects of cell sites on their
physical surroundings. However, the Plan is in the process of being revised. Current proposed changes will impose
additional restrictions and requirements on the construction and operation of cell sites. On June 1, 2010, the
National Council for Planning and Building approved the National Zoning Plan No. 36/A/1 version that
incorporates all of the amendments to the Plan (the “Amended Plan”). The main amendments to the Plan are:
(a) the Amended Plan provides for full liability for depreciated property claims on the mobile operators; (b) the
Amended Plan prohibits the erection of poles in urban areas (excluding industrial zones) and in rural areas
(excluding next to existing infrastructure); (c) the Amended Plan grants to the municipalities the authority to
approve local zoning plans that will regulate the deployment of site; and (d) the Amended Plan demands a
minimum distance of four meters between antenna poles on a rooftop.

The Amended Plan is subject to governmental approval, in accordance with the Planning and Building Law. It is
unknown if, and when, the government intends to approve the Amended Plan. If the Amended Plan is approved,
it may have a significant impact on our ability to get permits for our mobile sites. In addition, we may need to
change the location of our future mobile network sites to less suitable locations, which may have an adverse effect
on the quality and capacity of our mobile network coverage. The cost of complying with the Amended Plan might
be substantial and may adversely affect our revenues and profits. The Amended Plan has not yet received the
required approval.

_Radio Access Devices_

Most mobile operators have historically relied on an exemption from obtaining a building permit under the
Construction and Planning Law for constructing rooftop mobile radio access devices, which was consistent with
the Israeli Attorney General opinion on the matter.

In September 2010, the Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction that forbid the continued construction of
access facilities in cellular basis on the basis of an exemption from building permits (requested in two petitions
filed in July 2008 and June 2009). The temporary injunction, issued at the request of the Attorney General, will
remain in effect until the proposed regulations are passed or the court decides otherwise. In his announcement,
the Attorney General noted that when the winners are declared for the frequency tender in which HOT Mobile
took part and won, he may ask that the injunction be reduced. The injunction will not apply to the replacement of
existing access facilities under certain circumstances.

In September 2010, the Court issued a temporary injunction on the petitions. As part of its response to the petition,
the Sate responded that he reduction in the scope of the order regarding the new operators shall be in effect until
June 30 2014, and that after that date the sole opportunity for establishing access facilities will be after approving
the relevant regulations, and in accordance with the restrictions set therein. In September 2014, a hearing was held

on the petitions before the Court, with no ruling yet received. In March 2016, the Court updated the ordinance in
such a manner that allows HOT Mobile and Partner to unify both companies access facilities in the joint network
and as part of this, move the location of some of the facilities.

In December 2017, a discussion was held at the Knesset Economics Committee (the “Economics Committee”)
on the new wording of regulations issued by the Minister of Finance in coordination with the other relevant
government ministries. The Economics Committee did not finish its discussion of all of the items, and therefore
made clear that a follow-up meeting would be set for the regulations. The proposed wording was recommended
by the National Council of Planning and Construction. Inasmuch as the wording is approved in the format sent to
the Economics Committee, this will make it very difficult to move wireless access facilities from one place to
another as well as make changes to existing access facilities.

Radio access devices also require permits from the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection. The local
planning and building committee’s engineer may object to the exemption for a permit requirement prior to
installing radio access devices. An annulment of, or inability to rely on, or substantial limitation of, the exemption
could adversely affect our existing network and network build out (particularly given the objection of some local
planning and building authorities to grant due permits where required), could have a negative impact on our ability
to obtain environmental permits for these sites, could negatively affect the extent, quality, capacity and coverage
of our network and have a negative impact on our ability to continue to market our mobile services effectively.

_The Non-Ionising Radiation Law_

In accordance with the provisions of the Non-Ionizing Radiation Law and the amendment to the Planning and
Construction Law, which among other things establish a requirement to deposit a letter of indemnification from
suits for the loss of value of real estate as a condition for receiving a permit to build a broadcast facility. According
to the National Council for Planning and Construction’s guidelines, a 100% indemnity obligation was established.
After the law was passed, as of December 31, 2016, HOT Mobile has submitted 346 letters of indemnity as a
condition for the receipt of building licenses at various sites around the country.

As of this date, no claims have been filed against the group by virtue of the letters of indemnity and according to
the announcement of the Attorney General, claims by virtue of the letters of indemnification filed one year after
receiving the building permit will not be recognized.

Note that to date, a partial version of the regulations has been ratified, and the chapter of the regulations pertaining
to maximum radiation levels has yet to be completed. A version of the chapter in question approved by the Minister
of Communications has been filed by the Ministry of the Environment, for the approval of the Knesset Interior
and Environmental Committee, but did not secure its approval, as the Committee requested stricter criteria for
permits issued by the environmental radiation supervisor. If the Committee’s requests are accepted, HOT Mobile
estimates that it may have a material impact on its ability to provide cellular services in the State of Israel.

**_Prohibition of Exit Fee_**

On March 21, 2012, the Knesset passed an amendment to the Communications Law in order to prohibit a license
holder from collecting an exit or termination fee from new subscribers who cancel their agreement with the license
holder. A license holder is still permitted to collect the balance of payment owed to it by the subscriber relating
to the purchase of end user equipment. The amendment does not apply to large subscribers who have purchased
100 or more lines. Additionally, under the terms of the amendment, as of January 2013, it is not be possible to
link a transaction for the purchase of end user equipment and the provision of mobile services.

**_Mobile Virtual Network Operator_**

A mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, is a mobile operator that does not own its own spectrum and does
not have its own radio network infrastructure. Instead, MVNOs have business arrangements with existing mobile
operators to use their infrastructure and network for the MVNO’s own customers. The Communications Law was
amended in July 2009 to provide for MVNO licenses, and, in January 2010, the regulations necessary for the
granting of an MVNO license were promulgated. The regulations regulate the operation of an MVNO pursuant to
an agreement to be reached and entered between a mobile operator and an MVNO and sets, among others, the
conditions for receiving an MVNO license, including a requirement to operate a mobile phone switch, a restriction
on a mobile operator and a fixed line operator to receive an MVNO license and limitations on parties related to
an existing mobile operator and on other communication licensees to receive an MVNO license. The amendment


-----

provides that in the event that an, MVNO and mobile operator will not have reached an agreement as to the
provision of service by way of MVNO within six months from the date the MVNO has approached the mobile
operator, and if the Ministry together with the Israeli Ministry of Finance determine that the failure to reach an
agreement is due to unreasonable conditions imposed by the mobile operator, the Ministry will use its authority
to provide instructions. Such instructions may include intervening in the terms of the agreement, including by
setting the price of the service. Over the years, the Ministry has granted eleven MVNO licenses.

**_Fees and Royalty Payments_**

In accordance with our Mobile License, we were required to pay to the State of Israel a total license fee of NIS
705 million, out of which we paid NIS 10 million at the time of receiving the license. We then provided a bank
guarantee to the State of Israel for the remaining NIS 695 million. As of the first testing date on September 26,
2013, we achieved a market share calculated in accordance with the license agreement that entitled us to a
deduction of the entire amount of the NIS 695 million license fee outstanding. Accordingly, we requested the
Ministry to reduce the amount of the bank guarantee to an amount of NIS 80 million as guarantee of our obligation
to achieve certain territorial coverage requirements under our license. On November 21, 2013, the Ministry
notified HOT Mobile that the license fees were to be decreased to NIS 10 million (which has already been paid)
and the bank guarantee shall be decreased from the amount of NIS 695 million to an amount of NIS 80 million.

**_Reduction of Interconnection Fees_**

Effective December 1, 2013, interconnection fees between fixed line telephony service providers (including
Bezeq, VoIP or VOB providers and us) were reduced by 60% and set at NIS 0.01.

**_Copyright/Trademark Law_**

Israel grants copyright protection to original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, as well as sound
recordings and computer programs under the Copyright Law, 5767 2007. Copyright protection automatically
exists with respect to works which comply with the terms set forth in the Copyright Law. Under the Copyright
Law, generally, protection of a work runs from the date of creation until the end of the seventieth year after the
year of the death of the author. Israel is party to a number of multinational treaties relating to copyrights, including
the Berne Convention.

In Israel, trademarks are governed by Trade Marks Ordinance (New Version), 5732 1972. A trademark registration
is valid for 10 years from the date of the trademark application. The registration may be renewed for further
periods of 10 years after each renewal. The legal protection of a trademark is conditioned on it having distinctive
character. Israeli law also provides for legal protection to unregistered trademarks. Under the Trade Marks
Ordinance an owner of a trademark that is well known in Israel can exclude others from using the mark, even
when the trademark was not registered in Israel. Israel is also party to a number of multinational treaties relating
to trademarks.

**_Structural Separation_**

In November 2003, as part of the steps taken to merge the cable companies and expand of the activity of the cable
companies into the communications sector, including providing telephony services, the cable companies,
including the Company, set up HOT, as a joint corporation, designed to operate domestic fixed-line telephone
services over the cable network. HOT began operating on January 1, 2004, and since the completion of the merger,
it has coordinated all of the Company’s communications activity.

As stated, as part of the policy of the Ministry of Communications for increasing competition in the
communications market, provisions were stipulated in the domestic operator license regarding structural
separation between the broadcasting license holder and the domestic operator license holder.

In accordance with the domestic operator license and the broadcasting license provisions, regarding structural
separation between the Company and HOT, they are permitted to work together in offering joint product packages,
which include multi-channel television services, telephony services and internet infrastructure access services.

In accordance with the provisions of the Licenses, the Group uses for its activity, various restrictions are placed
on the activity of group companies, which prevent full synergy in the Group’s activity, including the requirement
for separate managements at some of the companies. On June 30, 2020, the Ministry of Communications allowed


-----

HOT to provide joined packages including triple-play services with HOT Net’s ISP services, subject to certain
conditions, and HOT began to provide such packages as of July 15, 2020. Further, in February 2021 the Ministry
of Communications amended HOT Mobile’s and HOT Net’s licenses to enable them to provide triple-play
packages together with HOT Mobile’s mobile cellular services and HOT Net’s international calls services, subject
to the Ministry’s approval. On May 30, 2021, the Ministry of Communications approved the marketing of quadplay packages including triple-play services with HOT Net’s ISP services and HOT Mobile’s mobile cellular
services.

**_Centralization Law_**

On December 9, 2013, the Knesset Finance Committee approved the bill for promoting competition and reducing
concentration. According to the law, a committee will be established with the objective to supervise the attempts
to limit concentration, headed by the Antitrust Commissioner and hosting members such as the General Director
of the Ministry of Finance and the head of the National Economic Council or one of his deputies appointed by the
prime minister. Under the bill, among other things, the regulator may decide not to assign any right, including the
right to grant or extend a license, to a concentrated factor as it is defined in the law, if it finds that it is unlikely
that any real harm may be caused to the sector in which this rights is assigned and the regulation of such sector.
Also, a regulator seeking to allow the assignment of a right, including the grant or extension of a license, will not
do so, including not allowing any concentrated factor to participate in the assignment procedure of this right and
not setting any conditions that allow its assignment, but only after taking into account considerations of cross
market concentration in consultation with the entity in charge of the concentration reduction. In addition, the law
provides, inter alia, that when assigning a right and setting its terms the regulator must consider, in addition to
any other vital consideration as specified by law, considerations of promoting competition in the sector, and, if
the right is included in the list of rights issued by the Antitrust Commissioner in this regard, the regulator may
assign this right only after considering promoting competition in the sector in consultation with the Antitrust
Commissioner. The group was included in the list of centralized bodies published by the antitrust authority.

**_Consumer Protection and Regulatory Bills_**

The Group’s activity in Israel is subject to general legal provisions that regulate the relationship and the method
of engagement between it and its customers. As such, the group’s activity is subject to the Consumer Protection
Law. Among other things, the Consumer Protection Law grants the court the option to rule compensation without
providing damage in the cases denoted therein, which include consumer requests that a business cease billing
them after the conclusion of the transaction or the commitment; failure to provide consumers with written notice
that the engagement between them and the business will continue after the end of the commitment period, unless
the consumer informs them that they wish to end it, up to level of 10,000 NIS. In cases of repeated or ongoing
violations, the compensation level can reach a sum of 50,000 NIS.

Frequent changes in the Consumer Protection law influence the group’s activity in Israel, as provider of services
to a large number of private consumers, due to the expenses involving in implementing them, and due to changes
that may occur to the format of the company’s behavior with its customers.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

The Group has entered into various agreements or transactions with its equity associates, its ultimate controlling
shareholder and its principal shareholder, Altice Europe, as well as the companies that its ultimate controlling
shareholder controls from time to time. These agreements and transactions are carried out on arm’s length terms
and the Group believes that the terms of these agreements are no more favorable to the related parties and the
Group’s affiliates than what they would have been with disinterested third parties.

The following summary describes the Group’s material related party transactions. See Note 28 to the 2020
Financial Statements and Note 30 to the 2019 Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum, for more information.

**Transactions with Altice Europe**

**_General_**

In the ordinary course of business, we have entered into arrangements with Altice Europe and its affiliates for the
provision or sourcing of certain products and services (by Altice Europe to the Group and vice-versa) and/or
negotiation of related contractual arrangements, including the following:

- procurement of services, such as access to an international communications backbone, international carrier
services and call termination services;

- prior to the acquisition of ATS, the Group relied on Altice Europe for the purchase of technical support
services; and

- negotiation of programming contracts and acquisition of content, as further described below.

**_Transactions with Altice France and Altice TV_**

We completed the transfer of our Altice TV business to an affiliate of the Group on May 15, 2018. In connection
with the renegotiation of the existing sports content wholesale contracts between Altice France and AENS, the
content contracts were cancelled and replaced by new revenue sharing contracts with a lower guaranteed minimum
income. Altice TV received an indemnity of €300 million from companies in the Altice France Group as part of
the renegotiation in connection therewith. Following such sale and prior to the reorganization of the content
activities, Altice Europe operated the Altice TV division which, with its subsidiaries (including AENS) and Altice
Pictures S.à.r.l (“Altice Pictures”), a subsidiary of Altice Europe incorporated in Luxembourg, encompassed
Altice Europe’s content distribution division. On July 7, 2020, Altice Europe reorganized the corporate
organizational structure for content activities. SportCoTV S.A.S. (“SportCoTV”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Altice France, acquired the shares of Altice Pictures, which at the time held the rights for sports content, including
UEFA champions league and other premium content. Business of the Altice TV division now conducted by
SportCoTV is consolidated in the financial statements of Altice France.

The Group has entered into various arrangements with the Altice TV division, including non-exclusive distribution
rights in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic provided to the Group of Netflix and Discovery channels.
The total expenses for the transactions with Altice TV for the year ended December 31, 2020 and for the three
months ended March 31, 2021 amounted to €2 million and €11 million, respectively.

International’s sole shareholder, Altice Lux. On December 30, 2020, the existing agreement was amended with a
revised maturity date of December 31, 2023 and an interest rate which is based on the annual interest rate accrued
on the Group’s senior debt. Following the amended agreement, the existing liability was derecognized and a new
liability was recorded, resulting in the recognition of an interest expense of €18 million and an extinguishment of
debt of €478 million. The non-current portion of the AI Mandatory Convertible Notes liability recorded at

transaction value was 1 CHF.

AMI, a company based in Switzerland and a direct subsidiary of Altice Group Lux, acted as the global provider
of call center and telemarketing services to the Group. These services improved the efficiency of the services
provided by the Group for the benefit of its customers and were provided at price points that are lower relative to
prior arrangements between the Group and multiple external suppliers that previously delivered such services. All
of these services, for which AMI charged management fees to the Group, were terminated during 2018. As of
March 31, 2021, the Group owed nil trade receivables to AMI.

**_European Commission gun jumping penalty_**

In connection with the EC’s €125 million fine imposed on the Group and Altice Europe following the EC’s
investigation on gun jumping during the PT Portugal Acquisition, we agreed to reimburse Altice Europe in an
amount equal to the penalty amount. As a result, a trade payable to Altice Europe of €130 million was outstanding
as of March 31, 2021.

**_Brand license and service agreement_**

The Group licences the Altice brand from Next Alt as part of a brand licence and services agreement entered into
in 2016. As part of this agreement, the Group has the exclusive right to use the Altice brand for corporate
identification purposes and commercial purposes in the telecommunication, content and media sectors in the
territory defined in the agreement (which, since the separation, excludes North America). In 2017, the brand
licence and services agreement was amended. Instead of a fee, Next Alt was granted 30 million stock options. On
June 7, 2018, Next Alt transferred the options to its parent company Next Luxembourg S.C.Sp.


-----

**Transactions with Altice USA**

Teads and Altice Dominicana provide online advertising and long-distance traffic services, respectively, to Altice
USA. In addition, PT Portugal sold equipment to Altice USA. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and
for the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues generated by the Group related to such services and sales
amounted to €10 million and €41 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2021, the outstanding trade receivables
balance owed by Altice USA to the Group was €11 million and related primarily to the transactions with Teads
and PT Portugal.

**Transactions with Teads Management**

**_Pierre Chappaz and Bertrand Quesada_**

Teads and Pierre Chappaz, a founder and director of Teads, have agreed that Pierre Chappaz will be entitled to a
one-time fee of $35 million. This one-time fee will be paid by Teads in October 2022. With respect to this fee,
Teads does not expect that any Dutch income taxes, any Dutch wage withholding taxes or any value added taxes
will be due. If, however, any Dutch income taxes would be due by Pierre Chappaz or any Dutch wage withholding
taxes would have to be withheld by Teads on his behalf in connection with this fee, Teads will gross up the onetime fee to cover such taxes and, as the case may be, any related costs (including but not limited to late payment
interest and penalties). In addition, if any value added taxes would be due in connection with this fee, Teads will
bear such value added taxes itself as well as any related costs; it is uncertain what part, if any, of such value added
tax charges would be recoverable by Teads. The Dutch maximum statutory progressive income and wage tax rate
is 49.50% and the general Dutch value added tax rate is 21%. As a consequence, the total amount to be paid by
Teads may be up to $70 million (excluding any possible related costs) plus any non-recoverable Dutch value
added taxes.

Further, Teads and each of Pierre Chappaz and Bertrand Quesada (co-founder, director and CEO of Teads) have
agreed that Pierre Chappaz and Bertrand Quesada, in connection with their appointment as executive directors of
Teads, will each be granted a one-time bonus of $21 million by Teads. These one-time bonuses will be paid by
Teads in May 2022. With respect to the one-time bonus of Pierre Chappaz, Teads will gross up the one-time bonus
for all Dutch income taxes that will become due by him and all Dutch wage withholding taxes to be withheld by
Teads on his behalf in connection with this bonus. Based on the Dutch maximum statutory progressive income
and wage tax rate of 49.50%, the total amount to be paid by Teads in respect of Pierre Chappaz may be up to $41
million. Teads and Pierre Chappaz will file an application with the Dutch Revenue Service for the purpose of
designating 30% of the appointment bonus as tax-exempt wages, which, if granted, may reduce the total amount
of the cost with respect to the one-time bonus of Pierre Chappaz to no more than $35 million.

In addition to the above, Altice International has entered into certain arrangements pursuant to which it has the
option to purchase, and the managers of Teads have the option to sell, certain minority interest in Teads (via an
indirect holding company) with an exercise price based on a pre-determined formula. As of March 31, 2021, the
financial liability relating to the put options based on the discounted cash flows valuation recognized in the
consolidated financial statements is €205.9 million and the financial asset relating to the call option based on the
Black and Scholes model recognized in the consolidated financial statements is €158.0 million.

**_Transactions with Fibroglobal_**

The Group holds a 5% interest in Fibroglobal—Comunicações Electrónicas (“Fibroglobal”), a fiber network and

for any new customer installation and a monthly fee for PT Portugal’s customer base that use Fibroglobal’s

**_Altice Financing 2026 Notes_**

On May 3, 2016, Altice Financing issued $2,750 million aggregate principal amount of its 7[1]∕2% senior secured
notes due 2026 (the “Altice Financing 2026 Notes”). Between June 4, 2020 and September 25, 2020, Altice
Financing repurchased and cancelled the Altice Financing 2026 Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to
$279 million. The Altice Financing 2026 Notes mature on May 15, 2026. Interest on the Altice Financing 2026
Notes is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on each January 15 and July 15. The Altice Financing 2026
Notes are governed by a New York law governed indenture entered into on May 3, 2016 (the “Altice Financing
**2026 Notes Indenture”).**

The Altice Financing 2026 Notes are general obligations of Altice Financing and (i) rank pari passu in right of
payment with any existing or future indebtedness of Altice Financing that is not subordinated in right of payment
to the Altice Financing 2026 Notes, (ii) rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future indebtedness of
Altice Financing that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Altice Financing 2026 Notes and (iii) are
effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of Altice Financing that is secured by property or
assets that do not secure the Altice Financing 2026 Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets
securing such indebtedness.

The Altice Financing 2026 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Altice International, Altice
Caribbean, Cool Holding, Hadaros, Altice Holdings, Altice West Europe, Altice Portugal, Altice Bahamas, Altice
Dominicana, PT Portugal and PT OpCo (the “Altice Financing Notes Guarantors”). Each such guarantee is a
general obligation of the applicable Altice Financing Notes Guarantor and (i) ranks pari passu in right of payment
with any existing and future indebtedness of the applicable Altice Financing Notes Guarantor that is not
subordinated in right of payment to such Altice Financing Notes’ guarantee; (ii) ranks senior in right of payment
to all existing and future indebtedness of the applicable Altice Financing Notes Guarantor that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to such Altice Financing Notes’ guarantee; (iii) is effectively subordinated to
any existing and future indebtedness of the applicable Altice Financing Notes Guarantor, including any existing
or future indebtedness of such Altice Financing Notes Guarantor that is secured by property or assets that do not

securing such indebtedness; and (iv) is structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other obligations of any
subsidiary of such Altice Financing Notes Guarantor that does not guarantee the Altice Financing 2026 Notes.
The guarantees of the Altice Financing 2026 Notes are subject to release under certain circumstances.

The Altice Financing 2026 Notes are secured by the Senior Secured Collateral.

On or after May 15, 2021, Altice Financing may redeem some or all of the Altice Financing 2026 Notes at the
redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, during the period of twelve
months from May 15 of each year indicated below:

**Year** **Repurchase price**

2021 ................................................................................................................................................. 103.750%
2022 ................................................................................................................................................. 102.500%
2023 ................................................................................................................................................. 101.250%

In addition, Altice Financing may redeem all of the Altice Financing 2026 Notes at a price equal to their principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, upon the occurrence of certain changes
in tax law. If we and our restricted subsidiaries sell certain of our assets or if Altice Financing or we experience
specific kinds of changes in control, Altice Financing may be required to make an offer to repurchase the Altice
Financing 2026 Notes at specified redemption prices.

The Altice Financing 2026 Notes Indenture, among other things, limits our ability, the ability of Altice
International and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined therein) to (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness

(subject to an incurrence-based consolidated leverage ratio test), (ii) make investments or other restricted
payments, (iii) create liens, (iv) sell assets and subsidiary stock, (v) pay dividends or make other distributions or
repurchase or redeem our capital stock or subordinated debt, (vi) engage in certain transactions with affiliates,
(vii) enter into agreements that restrict the payment of dividends by subsidiaries or the repayment of intercompany
loans and advances and (viii) engage in mergers or consolidations. These covenants are subject to a number of
important exceptions and qualifications. The Altice Financing 2026 Notes Indenture permits the incurrence of
senior secured indebtedness by Altice Financing so long as the consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio (pro
_forma for such transaction) is not greater than 3 to 1. Subject to the consolidated net leverage ratio not exceeding_
4 to 1 (pro forma for such transaction) and so long as there is no default or event of default outstanding, the Altice
Financing 2026 Notes Indenture permits the distribution of dividends and other restricted payments so long as the
aggregate amount of restricted payments does not exceed the sum of an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA
(as defined therein) generated from the period beginning on the first day of the first full fiscal quarter commencing
prior to December 12, 2012 until the most recently ended quarter, less 1.5 times the consolidated interest expense
for such period (although compliance with such consolidated net leverage ratio is not required to make a restricted
investment). The restricted payment capacity is also subject to increase based on certain provisions that are
customary for an incurrence based covenant package. In addition, the Altice Financing 2026 Notes Indenture
permits unlimited restricted payments so long as the consolidated net leverage ratio (pro forma for such transaction)
is not greater than 4 to 1.

The Altice Financing 2026 Notes Indenture provides for certain events of default, including, amongst others,
defaults under other debt instruments which (i) is caused by the failure to pay principal of indebtedness at its stated
maturity prior to the expiration of the applicable grace period or (ii) results in the acceleration of such indebtedness
prior to its maturity, and, in each case, the principal amount of such indebtedness (together with the principal
amount of any other such indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which
has been accelerated) aggregates €25 million or more.

The Altice Financing 2026 Notes Indenture, the Altice Financing 2026 Notes and the guarantees thereof are

entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Altice Financing Term Loan
Agreement and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Altice Financing Term Loan Agreement permits the incurrence of senior secured indebtedness so long as the
consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio (pro forma for such transaction) is not greater than 3 to 1. Subject

on the first full fiscal quarter commencing prior to December 12, 2012 until the most recently ended quarter, less
1.5 times the consolidated interest expense for such period (although compliance with such consolidated net
leverage ratio is not required to make a restricted investment). The restricted payment capacity is also subject to
increase based on certain provisions that are customary for an incurrence based covenant package. In addition,

_Structure of the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities_

On February 20, 2020 Altice Financing obtained requisite consents from the lenders under the 2014 Pari Passu
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to make certain amendments to the 2014 _Pari Passu Revolving Credit_
Facility Agreement, including reduction of the margin and extension of the maturity date and on April 29, 2020,
the 2014 _Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility Agreement was amended and restated to incorporate such_
amendments. The final maturity date of the 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility is the earlier of (i) February
20, 2025 and (ii) the date on which each such Facility has been fully repaid and cancelled. On September 30, 2020
Altice Financing obtained requisite consents from the lenders under the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement to make certain amendments to the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
including reduction of the margin and extension of the maturity date and on December 15, 2020, the 2015 Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement was amended and restated to incorporate such amendments. In
connection with such amendment and restatement, the €288 million commitments under the 2015 Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility were divided into Facility A and Facility B. The €145 million commitments under
Facility A have matured and lapsed. The final maturity date of the remaining €143 million of commitments under
Facility B is the earlier of (i) January 31, 2025 and (ii) the date on which the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit

Financing Revolving Credit Facility Agreements for terms of, at the relevant borrower’s election, one, two, three
or six months (or any other period agreed by Altice Financing and the relevant lenders), but no such period shall
end beyond the final maturity date of the relevant Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.
Drawdowns under the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facility Agreements must be repaid at the end of the
interest period for the relevant loan and repaid amounts may be re-borrowed up to one month prior to the final
maturity date (save for certain roll-over loans).

_Limitations on Use of Funds_

The Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities and the 2017 Altice Financing Guarantee Facility (as defined
below) may be used by the borrowers for general corporate and working capital purposes of the applicable
Restricted Group, including, but not limited to, the refinancing of all or part of any existing financial indebtedness
of such Restricted Group.

**_The Intercreditor Agreement_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors, certain obligors under the Altice Financing Notes, the
Altice Finco 2028 Notes, the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities, the Altice Financing Guarantee
Facilities, the Altice Financing Term Loans and certain counterparties to hedging obligations relating to the
foregoing, have entered into an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) with, among others,:

        - the creditors of the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities (the “RCF Creditors”);

        - any persons that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as counterparties to certain hedging
agreements in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Hedging
**Agreements” and any person that accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement as counterparties to**
the Hedging Agreements are referred to in such capacity as the “Hedging Banks” and, together
with the RCF Creditors (excluding the creditors under the 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit
Facility), the “Super Priority Creditors”);

        - any persons that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement under any future term facility (including
the Altice Financing Term Loans) or revolving bank facility (including the 2017 Altice
Financing Guarantee Facility and 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility, but excluding the
2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility) designated a senior bank facility in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Senior Bank Creditors”);


-----

        - any persons that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as trustee (the “Senior Secured Notes
**Trustee”) for the Altice Financing 2025 Notes, the Altice Financing 2026 Notes and the Altice**
Financing 2028 Notes (and together, the “Senior Secured Notes”) on its behalf and on behalf
of the holders of such Senior Secured Notes (the “Senior Secured Notes Creditors” and,
together with any Senior Bank Creditors, the “Senior Creditors” and, together with the Super
Priority Creditors, the “Senior Secured Creditors”);

        - any persons that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as trustee (the “Senior Subordinated
**Notes Trustee”) for the Altice Finco 2028 Notes (and together, the “Senior Subordinated**
**Notes”) on its behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes (the “Senior**
**Subordinated Notes** **Creditors” or the “Senior Subordinated Creditors”);**

        - certain intra-group creditors (the “Intercompany Creditors”)

        - certain members of the group who are or become structural creditors in respect of certain intragroup liabilities (the “Structural Creditors”);

        - certain investors (the “Shareholders” together with Intercompany Creditors, the
###### “Subordinated Creditors”);

        - Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as security agent for the Senior Secured Creditors (the
###### “Security Agent”);

        - Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as facility agent or any other administrative agent or
replacement agent; and

        - Citibank, N.A., London Branch as security agent for the Structural Creditors (the “Structural
**Creditor Security Agent”).**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that future indebtedness may be incurred by us and our subsidiaries subject
to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and each finance document then existing. Future Super Priority Debt
may, however, only be in the form of a revolving credit facility, which is a working capital facility or hedging
indebtedness to the extent permitted (or not prohibited) by the terms of each finance document (including the
indentures) or consented to by the appropriate parties. The aggregate commitment under all revolving credit
facilities (including the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility) that are designated as Super Priority Debt
cannot exceed the greater of $80 million or 4% of total assets at any time.

For the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditors of each class of debt will vote together and a
representative trustee or agent of debt within that class of debt (a “Representative”) may act on the instructions
of the majority of creditors of that class of debt (or, in the case of the Super Priority Debt or Senior Bank Debt (as
defined below), on the instructions of 66[2]/3% of creditors of that class of debt) (a “Relevant Majority”). Hedging
Banks will vote together with the Super Priority Creditors while any Super Priority Debt remains outstanding. In
addition, in certain circumstances (as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement) certain classes of creditors will vote
together as part of an instructing group (the “Instructing Group”), which is the Relevant Majority of (i) (if Senior
Bank Debt has not been incurred or, if incurred, has been discharged and while any Senior Secured Notes Debt
remains outstanding) the Senior Secured Notes Creditors, (ii) (while Senior Bank Debt (as defined below) remains
outstanding) the Senior Creditors and (iii) (if the Senior Secured Debt has been discharged and while the Senior
Subordinated Notes Debt remains outstanding) the Senior Subordinated Creditors.

By accepting a Senior Secured Note or a Senior Subordinated Note, as the case may be, the relevant holder thereof
shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, that are contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement that relate to the rights and obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Creditors and the Senior
Subordinated Notes Creditor. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement nor does it describe provisions
relating to the rights and obligations of holders of other classes of our debt or capital expenditures.

Notes Debt of the Senior Subordinated Notes Issuer) must be turned over to the Security Agent pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement for application in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. See “—Turnover”.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for certain additional restrictions on the form, provisions and terms of the
documents evidencing the Structural Debt. No Structural Creditor and no member of the Group will be entitled to
make material amendments to the documents evidencing the Structural Debt without the prior written consent of
the relevant Representative representing the Super Priority Creditors, the Senior Bank Creditors and the Senior
Secured Notes Creditors.

**_Limitation of Credit Support_**

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Obligors are prohibited from granting any security in favor of any
Senior Secured Debt unless that security is given in favor of the Security Agent to hold for the benefit of all other
Senior Secured Debt.

A Representative representing (i) the relevant Senior Bank Lenders or (ii) the relevant Senior Secured Notes
Creditors or (iii) the relevant Super Priority Creditors (each in accordance with its underlying documents) may


-----

serve a notice specifying that an event of default is outstanding and suspend the payment of any Senior

**_Restrictions on Enforcement_**

Subject to certain limited exceptions, and except with the consent of the Relevant Majority of Super Priority
Creditors (while the Super Priority Debt is outstanding) and the Instructing Group (while Senior Secured Debt is
outstanding) the Senior Subordinated Creditors cannot (i) demand payment of any Senior Subordinated Notes
Debt or Subordinated Debt, (ii) accelerate any of the Senior Subordinated Notes Debt or the Subordinated Debt
or otherwise declare any of the aforementioned debt prematurely due or payable on an event of default or
otherwise, (iii) enforce any of the Senior Subordinated Notes Debt or Subordinated Debt by attachment, set-off,
execution or otherwise, (iv) (in the case of Senior Subordinated Creditors) enforce the Security relating to the
Senior Subordinated Notes Debt, (v) petition for, initiate, support or take any steps with a view to any insolvency
or any voluntary arrangement or assignment for the benefit of creditors or any similar proceedings involving an
Obligor, (vi) sue or bring or support any legal proceedings against any Obligor or its subsidiaries or (vii) otherwise
exercise any remedy for the recovery of any Senior Subordinated Notes Debt or Subordinated Debt. The
aforementioned does not prohibit the Senior Subordinated Creditors from, among others, (i) taking any necessary
action to preserve the validity and existence of any claims, (ii) taking any action against any creditor to challenge
the basis on which any sale or disposal is to take place pursuant to powers granted under any security documents,
(iii) bringing proceedings in relation to violations of securities laws/regulations or for fraud, (iv) bringing
proceedings solely for injunctive relief to restrain any actual or punitive breach of the indenture governing the
Senior Subordinated Notes or for specific performance not claiming damages not inconsistent with the
Intercreditor Agreement, (v) bringing proceedings against the Senior Subordinated Notes Issuer, or (vi) requesting
judicial interpretation of any provision of any Senior Subordinated Creditor finance document. A Senior
Subordinated Creditor or Subordinated Creditor will be allowed to bring or support proceedings to prevent the
loss of any right to bring or support proceeding by reason of expiry of statutory limitation periods. Subject to the
written instructions of the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the relevant Creditors entitled to take
enforcement action with respect to the Security) no Structural Creditor may, while any Senior Secured Debt is

-----

or supporting any legal proceedings against HOT and/or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, or (vi) otherwise
exercising any remedy for the recovery of any Structural Debt.

In addition to customary termination rights under the Hedging Agreements, the Hedging Banks benefit from
certain additional termination rights permitting termination or close-out of the relevant Hedging Agreement prior
to its stated maturity in the following circumstances (in each case subject to a grace period of at least 30 days from
the date of occurrence of the relevant circumstance, and subject in each individual circumstance to the applicable
grace periods set out in the relevant finance document):

(a) a payment default under any financial indebtedness (subject to any applicable grace period) of Altice
Finco, any Covenant Party or their subsidiaries in excess of $20 million has occurred;

(b) a default (other than a payment default) and subsequent acceleration of any amounts of financial
indebtedness equal to or greater than $20 million;

(c) failure by Altice Financing, an Obligor or a Significant Subsidiary (as defined in the Senior Secured
Notes Indentures) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $20 million (exclusive of any amounts
that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid,
discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final;

(d) any impairment of security and/or guarantees which constitutes an event of default under the Senior
Secured Notes Indentures;

(e) any event of default or prepayment event under the Senior Secured Notes Indentures or any other finance
document caused by a change of control; or

(f) any event of default or prepayment event under the Senior Secured Notes Indentures or any other finance
document which is caused as a result of: (i) a cross-default, (ii) a breach of the covenant relating to
indebtedness, (iii) a breach of the covenant relating to restricted payments, (iv) a breach of the covenant
relating to certain distributions, (v) a breach of the covenant relating to asset sales and subsidiary stock,
(vi) a breach of the covenant relating to issuer activities, (vii) a breach of the covenant relating to holding
company activities, (viii) a breach of the covenant relating to impairment of security and (ix) a breach of
the covenant relating to affiliate transactions.

**_Permitted Enforcement_**

Despite the restrictions of enforcement described above, the Intercreditor Agreement allows the Senior
Subordinated Creditors to take the aforementioned enforcement actions while any Senior Secured Debt is
outstanding if (i) payment of the Senior Secured Debt has been accelerated or declared prematurely due and
payable or payable on demand or the Relevant Majority of Super Priority Creditors and/or Senior Creditors have
taken any enforcement action under the security documents in relation to such debt, (ii) certain insolvency,
liquidation or other similar enforcement events have occurred with respect to an Obligor (other than an Obligor
that is not a borrower or guarantor under any Senior Secured Debt) and such actions are taken with respect to such
###### Obligor, (iii) there is an event of default under the Senior Subordinated Notes Debt for failure to pay principal at
its originally scheduled maturity, (iv) the proposed enforcement action has been consented to by the Relevant
Majority of Super Priority Debt, Senior Bank Creditors, Senior Secured Notes Creditors or (v) a period (the
“Standstill Period”) of not less than 179 days has elapsed from the date any Representative of the Senior Secured
Creditors received an Enforcement Notice from the Senior Subordinated Creditors relating to an event of default
under the applicable documents relating to such Senior Subordinated Debt and such event of default is outstanding
at (and has not been waived prior to) the end of the Standstill Period.

The Intercreditor Agreement will require the Security Agent to give prompt notice to the representative of the
Senior Subordinated Notes Debt if it is instructed to enforce the Security relating to the equity/ownership interest
securing Senior Secured Debt (a “Senior Enforcement”). During the period from the giving of that notice to the
date that the Security Agent ceases to use all reasonable commercial efforts to carry out that Senior Enforcement
as expeditiously as reasonably practicable having regard to the circumstances:

        - the Security Agent will not be permitted to enforce any Security over such equity interests in a
manner that would adversely affect such Senior Enforcement; and


-----

        - no Senior Subordinated Creditor will be permitted to take, or will be permitted to give any
instructions to the Security Agent to take, any enforcement action prohibited by the preceding
bullet,

provided that the foregoing will not prejudice any other rights of the Senior Subordinated Creditors to take any
enforcement action against any other Obligor that are permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Intercreditor Agreement will require the Security Agent to give prompt notice to the Representative of Senior
Subordinated Notes Debt of its ceasing to carry out a Senior Enforcement.

**_Enforcement Instructions_**

No Senior Secured Creditor or Senior Subordinated Notes Creditor has any independent power to enforce, or has
recourse to, any Security except through the Security Agent and the Security Agent shall enforce Security (if then
enforceable) if so instructed by (i) while the Super Priority Debt is outstanding, the Relevant Majority of Super
Priority Creditors or the Instructing Group and (ii) after the discharge of the Senior Secured Debt (or if permitted
to do so as described above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement”), the Relevant Majority of Senior Subordinated
Creditors. The Security Agent may disregard any instructions from any other person to enforce the Security and
may disregard any instructions to enforce any Security if those instructions are inconsistent with the Intercreditor
Agreement. The Security Agent is not obliged to enforce the Security if it is not appropriately indemnified by the
relevant Creditors.

No Structural Creditor has any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any security securing the
Structural Debt.

To the extent any Super Priority Creditors or the Instructing Group wish to accelerate any debt owing to any
Senior Secured Creditor, it must notify the Security Agent and each other Senior Secured Representative at least
three business days prior to the date it intends to accelerate. To the extent that the Super Priority Creditors or the
Instructing Group wish to enforce Security, they must notify the Security Agent and each other Senior Secured
Representative 10 business days prior to the date it issues the enforcement instructions (the “Proposed
**Enforcement Instruction Date”). If the Security Agent receives conflicting enforcement instructions prior to the**
Proposed Enforcement Instruction Date, the Representatives of the Super Priority Creditors and the
Representative of the Instructing Group shall consult with one another and with the Security Agent in good faith
for 30 days (or such shorter date as may be agreed). Consultation will not be required if the Security has become
enforceable as a result of an insolvency event relating to an Obligor against whom such enforcement action is
taken or if any of such instructing Representatives determines in good faith that consultation (and thereby the
delay) could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability to enforce the Security or the
realization of proceeds of enforcement.

While the Super Priority Debt is outstanding, if the Security Agent receives conflicting enforcement instructions
from the Representatives of the Super Priority Debt or the Instructing Group, and the 30 day consultation period
between the two parties has passed, the Security Agent shall comply with the instruction from the Instructing
Group. The failure by a relevant group of Creditors to issue enforcement instructions will be deemed to be
conflicting, provided that if the Representatives of the Instructing Group fail to give instructions as to enforcement
and the 30 day consultation period has elapsed without the Instructing Group issuing instructions, the Security
Agent will comply with the instructions of the Representatives of the Super Priority Debt. The instructions of the
Super Priority Creditors will prevail if (i) the Super Priority Creditors have not been fully and finally discharged
in cash within six months of the Proposed Enforcement Date, or (ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any
enforcement action within three months of the Proposed Enforcement Date. All enforcement instructions will
need to comply with the following security enforcement principles:

1. It shall be the aim of any enforcement of the Security to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective
(hereinafter defined). “Security Enforcement Objective” means maximizing, so far as is consistent with
a prompt and expeditious enforcement of the Security, the recovery of the Super Priority Creditors and
(without prejudice to the waterfall described in “—Application of Proceeds” below) the Senior Creditors.

2. The security enforcement principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written consent of
the Relevant Majority of Super Priority Creditors, an Instructing Group and the Security Agent.


-----

3. Without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective, the Security will be enforced and other action
as to enforcement of the Security will be taken such that either:

(a) in the event enforcement is being effected in accordance with the instructions of the Instructing
Group either:

(i) all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution
in accordance with the waterfall described in “—Application of Proceeds” below; or

(ii) sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash
###### to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the waterfall described
in “—Application of Proceeds” below, the Super Priority Debt is repaid and discharged
in full (unless the Relevant Majority of Super Priority Creditors agree otherwise); or

(b) in the event enforcement is being effected in accordance with the instructions of the Super
Priority Creditors either:

(i) all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution
in accordance with the waterfall described in “—Application of Proceeds” below; or

(ii) with the consent of the Instructing Group, the proceeds are received by the Security
Agent in cash and non-cash consideration for distribution in accordance with the
waterfall described in “—Application of Proceeds” below.

4. The enforcement must be prompt and expeditious it being acknowledged that, subject to the other
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the time frame for realization of value from the enforcement
of the Security pursuant to enforcement will be determined by (while any Super Priority Debt is
outstanding) the Representatives representing the Relevant Majority of Super Priority Creditors or the
relevant Representatives representing an Instructing Group provided that it is consistent with the Security
Enforcement Objective.

5. On:

(a) a proposed enforcement of any of the Security over assets other than shares in a member of the
Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds U.S.$3,000,000 (or its
equivalent); or

(b) a proposed enforcement of any of the Security over some, but not all, of the shares in a member
of the Holdco Group (being any Covenant Party and Altice Finco and their respective
Subsidiaries from time to time) over which Security exists,

the Security Agent shall, if so requested by (while the Super Priority Debt is outstanding) the
Representatives representing the Relevant Majority of Super Priority Creditors or the relevant
Representatives representing an Instructing Group, and at the expense of such creditors, obtain an
opinion from any (X) “big four” accounting firm, (Y) reputable and independent internationally
recognized investment bank, or (Z) other reputable and independent professional services firm
experience in restructuring and enforcement (a “Financial Advisor”), that the consideration for the sale
is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances. If the Security
Agent is unable to obtain such an opinion pursuant to this paragraph 5, it shall notify the Super Priority
Representatives and the Senior Representatives representing an Instructing Group and may proceed to
enforce the Security without obtaining such opinion.

6. The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of
a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the security enforcement principles or any
other provision of the Intercreditor Agreement.

7. The Financial Advisor’s opinion will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective
has been met.


-----

8. If enforcement of any Security is conducted by way of public auction in any relevant jurisdiction, no
Financial Advisor shall be required to be appointed in relation to such enforcement action. Nothing shall
require the enforcement of Security to take place by way of public auction.

**_Release of Security and Guarantees_**

An Obligor may dispose of an asset outside of the Holdco Group if (i) the disposal is not prohibited by the
underlying finance documents, or (ii) the disposal is being effected at the request of the relevant creditor in
circumstances where it is entitled to take enforcement action under the Intercreditor Agreement (and such disposal
is consistent with certain security enforcement principles), or (iii) the disposal is pursuant to enforcement action
in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, and, in each case, the Security Agent is authorized to release any
Security or any security securing the Structural Debt and other claims (including guarantees) under any finance
document over that asset and, if that asset comprises of the shares in the capital of an Obligor or any of its
subsidiaries which are subject to Security or any security securing the Structural Debt, release on behalf of the
relevant creditor and each Obligor and its Subsidiaries that subsidiary and its subsidiaries from all present and
future obligations and liabilities under the relevant finance document provided that the proceeds of the disposal is
applied in accordance with the relevant finance document and with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Where a disposal relates to (ii) or (iii) above, the Security Agent is only authorized to release the relevant Security
and liabilities owing to the Senior Subordinated Creditors if: (i) the proceeds are received by the Security Agent
in cash (or substantially all cash); (ii) the disposal is made pursuant to a public auction or with an opinion from a
restructuring advisor confirming that the disposal price is fair (taking into account all relevant circumstances); (iii)
the debt is simultaneously and unconditionally released (and not assumed by a purchaser or affiliate of a purchaser)
and (iv) the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Where liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Debt would otherwise be released, the relevant creditor may
elect to transfer such liabilities to Altice Finco or the original Shareholder. If shares in an Obligor or its holding
company are being disposed of and the Security Agent decides to dispose of all or part of the liabilities of such
Obligor, holding company or any subsidiary under the finance documents, the Security Agent may: (a) dispose of
all or part of such liabilities such that the transferee shall not be treated as a Senior Secured Creditor or a secured
party; and (b) dispose of all (and not part) of such liabilities owed to the Senior Secured Creditors on behalf of
the relevant creditors and Obligors such that the transferee be treated as a Senior Secured Creditor or a secured
party.

**_Turnover_**

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that if any Super Priority Creditor, Senior Secured Creditor (with
respect to proceeds from the enforcement of security and proceeds of certain disposals only), Structural Creditor
(with respect to proceeds from the enforcement of security securing the Structural Debt only), Senior Subordinated
Creditor or Subordinated Creditor receives or recovers a payment of any Senior Secured Debt, Structural Debt,
Senior Subordinated Notes Debt or Subordinated Debt which is prohibited by the Intercreditor Agreement or not
paid in accordance with the provisions described under “—Application of Proceeds”, subject to certain exceptions,
the receiving or recovering creditor will promptly notify the Security Agent and hold any amount on trust for the
creditors and, upon demand by the Security Agent, pay that amount to the Security Agent or, if lower, the amount
of debt owed to the relevant category of Creditor, in each case less the third party costs and expenses (if any)
reasonably incurred in receiving or recovering such amount, for application by the Security Agent in accordance
with the order of priority described under “—Application of Proceeds”. These provisions will not apply to any
receipt or recovery by the Hedging Banks in relation to certain netting and set-off arrangements with Obligors,
permitted refinancing or the loss sharing provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Subordination on Insolvency_**

After the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any Obligor (the “Insolvent Obligor”), the Senior
Subordinated Debt owed by the Insolvent Obligor will be subordinated in right of payment to the Super Priority
Debt and Senior Debt owed by such Insolvent Obligor. Moreover, the shareholder debt and (unless otherwise
required by (while the Super Priority Debt remains outstanding) the Relevant Majority of Super Priority Creditors
or the Instructing Group) the Intercompany Debt owed by the Insolvent Obligor will be subordinate in right of
payment to the Secured Debt owed by such Insolvent Obligor.


-----

**_Filing of Claims_**

While any Senior Secured Debt is outstanding, the Security Agent is authorized (acting on the instructions of
(while any Super Priority Debt excluding Hedging Debt is outstanding) the Relevant Majority of Super Priority
Creditors or the Instructing Group) to: (i) claim, enforce and prove for any debt owed by the Insolvent Obligor;
(ii) only with respect to shareholder debt, exercise all powers of convening meetings, voting and representations
in respect of the shareholder debt owed by the Insolvent Obligor; (iii) file claims and proofs, give receipts and
take all such proceedings and do all such things as the Security Agent considers reasonably necessary to recover
any debt owed by the Insolvent Obligor; and (iv) receive all payments of or in respect of any debt owed by the
Insolvent Obligor for application in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Application of Proceeds”.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing shall (i) entitle any party to exercise or require any other party to exercise
such power of voting or representation to waive, reduce, discharge, extend the due date for payment of or
reschedule any of the Senior Subordinated Debt, or (ii) be deemed to require any Senior Subordinated Notes
Creditor to hold a meeting or pass any resolution at such meeting or give any consent pursuant to the terms of any
finance documents, or (iii) authorize any Super Priority Creditor or Senior Secured Creditor to take any action
against the Senior Subordinated Notes Issuer in respect of the Senior Subordinated Debt.

If the Security Agent is not entitled or does not take any of the actions referred to above, the Representatives of
Senior Subordinated Debt, the Senior Subordinated Notes Creditor and the Subordinated Creditors (i) will each
do so promptly when requested by the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of (while Super Priority Debt is
outstanding) the Relevant Majority of Super Priority Creditors or the Instructing Group subject, in the case of
Senior Subordinated Creditors only, to either or both the Super Priority Creditors or the Senior Creditors giving
an appropriate indemnity for any costs and expenses which may be reasonably incurred by the Senior
Subordinated Creditors and their representative in doing or taking the actions so requested) and (ii) may each do
so to the extent permitted as described under “—Restrictions on Enforcement”.

Subject to the rights of any creditor (other than a Secured Creditor) with prior security or preferential claims, all
amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent in connection with the realization or
enforcement of Security created pursuant to the pledge of the shares of Altice Finco shall be held by the Security
Agent on trust to apply them at any time as the Security Agent (in its discretion) sees fit in the following order:

Agent and Senior Subordinated Notes Trustees and of any amounts due to each such party and

**_Amendment_**

Prior consent of each Representative (other than any Senior Subordinated Representative unless in respect of an
amendment, waiver or consent under any security document evidencing Security in favor of the Senior
Subordinated Creditors) is required for any waivers, consents, or amendments in relation to any security
documents (including any Structural Debt Security document) if any such amendments, waivers or consents would
adversely affect the nature or scope of the charged property or the nature or scope of the assets which are or
expressed to be the subject of security for the Structural Debt (the “Structural Debt Security”) or the manner in
which the proceeds of enforcement of Security or the Structural Debt Security is distributed.

Any Senior Subordinated Notes documents may be amended in accordance with their terms (i) if permitted by the
Senior Secured Debt documents or with the consent of (while Super Priority Debt excluding Hedging Debt is
outstanding) the representatives representing the Super Priority Creditors, the Senior Bank Creditors and (but only
to the extent prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indentures) the Senior Secured Note Creditors or (ii) in
certain other limited circumstances.

The Intercreditor Agreement may be amended by the Obligors and the Security Agent without consent of the other
parties if the amendment is to cure defects, typographical errors, resolve ambiguities or reflect changes, in each
case, of a minor technical or administrative nature. Where an amendment affects the rights and obligations of one
or more parties to the Intercreditor Agreement, and could not reasonably be expected to be adverse to the interests
of other parties or class of parties, only the parties affected by such amendment need to agree to the amendments.

Other than in respect of certain customary amendments and waivers (which require the consent of each of the
Senior Secured Creditors, the Senior Subordinated Creditors, the Super Priority Creditors, the Security Agent,
Altice Finco and Altice Financing), the Intercreditor Agreement may be amended or waived or any consent may
be given under it with the written agreement of the Majority Super Priority Creditors, the Majority Senior Bank
Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Notes Creditors and the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors, Altice
Financing, the Security Agent and the Structural Creditor Security Agent.

**_2018 Altice Financing Additional Financial Guarantee_**

An additional standalone financial guarantee for an aggregate principal amount of €31.125 million plus an
additional amount equal to the interest accrued in respect of the proportionate amount of the EC Fine (as defined
above) (as amended from time to time, the “2018 Altice Financing Additional Financial Guarantee”) was
issued on July 26, 2018 by Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank for the benefit of the EC.

The 2018 Altice Financing Additional Financial Guarantee is fully cash collateralized and has been made available
to guarantee the obligations of Altice Europe to the EC in connection with the EC Fine.

The 2018 Altice Financing Additional Financial Guarantee is provided on a one-year basis with automatic

**HOT Proceeds Note**

_HOT Proceeds Term Note_

On December 27, 2012, Altice Financing purchased an NIS 1,900,200,000 (€484 million equivalent as of March
31, 2021) intercompany term note issued by HOT, which was amended on March 15, 2019, to amend certain
terms of the term note, including the interest rate and interest payment dates (the “HOT Proceeds Term Note”).

_Interest_

The HOT Proceeds Term Note bears interest at a rate of 5.6% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in cash
in arrears on the date which is two business days prior to each March 15 and September 15, and shall be calculated
on the basis of a 360 day year composed of 12 months of 30 days each. The maturity date is the maturity date of
the Reference SSN Indenture (as defined below) or any other Altice Financing instrument specified in the HOT
Proceeds Term Note.

_Guarantees and Security_

The HOT Proceeds Term Note is a senior obligation of HOT and is guaranteed on a senior basis by the HOT
Proceeds Note Guarantors. The HOT Proceeds Term Note is secured by a pledge over substantially all of the
assets of the HOT and the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantors (including all of the share capital of HOT Mobile) but,
in each case, excluding (a) licenses issued by the Israeli Ministry of Communications, which are not assignable
as a matter of law and (b) certain end-user equipment (the “HOT Proceeds Note Collateral”).

_Repayment_

HOT may not prepay the HOT Proceeds Term Note except (i) in the event of a Change of Control, as defined in
the HOT Proceeds Term Note, (ii) upon certain asset sales and (iii) if duly approved by HOT and required in order
to facilitate or accommodate a repayment of certain Senior Secured Debt of Altice Financing.

_Change of Control_

If a change of control occurs, Altice Financing will have the right to require HOT to prepay all or any part of the
HOT Proceeds Term Note, together with a premium of 1% of the principal amount of the HOT Proceeds Term
Note prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the date of prepayment. Change of Control has the same
definition as provided in the relevant Altice Financing senior secured notes indenture referenced to in the HOT
Proceeds Term Note from time to time (“Reference SSN Indenture”).

_Covenants and Events of Default_

HOT has agreed, and has agreed to cause each of its subsidiaries, for the sole benefit of Altice Financing, (i) to be
bound by the covenants in Article 4 (Covenants) and Article 5 (Successor Company) of the Reference SSN
Indenture that are applicable to HOT and its subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Reference
SSN Indenture) and (ii) to comply with the obligations set forth in Section 11.01 (Notes _Collateral and Security_
_Documents) in the Reference SSN Indenture._

The HOT Proceeds Term Note contains events of default, substantially similar to those contained in the Reference
SSN Indenture, as they apply to HOT, which, if such event of default occurs, permits Altice Financing to declare
the HOT Proceeds Term Note due and payable immediately. However, upon an event of default under the Notes
(or any other Senior Secured Debt), HOT and its subsidiaries shall not be liable in any way, including by way of
cross-default, and shall not be required to repay any amounts outstanding, including any repayment premiums and
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, under the Notes (or any other Senior Secured Debt). Further, the HOT
Proceeds Note Guarantors will only guarantee HOT’s obligations under the HOT Proceeds Notes (the “HOT
**Proceeds Note Guarantees”). The HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees will be limited to an aggregate amount equal**
to the amount outstanding under the HOT Proceeds Notes which may vary from time to time in accordance with
the terms of the HOT Proceeds Notes. HOT and the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantors will only have liability to the
holders of the Altice Financing Notes in the event of an event of default under the HOT Proceeds Notes, in each
case, indirectly as a result of an assignment of the HOT Proceeds Notes and/or the ability of the holders of the
Senior Secured Debt to direct the actions of Altice Financing in connection with the HOT Proceeds Notes in


-----

accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent permitted thereby. The Altice Finco Notes
do not benefit from any assignment of the HOT Proceeds Notes.

_Conflicts_

For the avoidance of doubt, and despite HOT not being party to such agreements, other than with respect to the
covenants described above, in the event that any of the other terms or provisions of this HOT Proceeds Term Note
conflict with any terms or provisions of the Reference SSN Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or related
agreements that are applicable to HOT and the HOT Proceeds Term Note, Altice Financing has agreed and
acknowledged that (as between HOT and Altice Financing only) the terms or provisions of the HOT Proceeds
Term Note shall prevail.

_HOT Proceeds RCF Note_

On December 27, 2012, Altice Financing purchased an NIS 200 million (€51 million equivalent as of March 31,
2021) intercompany revolving credit facility note issued by HOT pursuant to which Altice Financing may make
available to HOT amounts borrowed by Altice Financing under the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility,
amended on March 15, 2019, to change certain terms of the agreement, including the interest rate, the maturity
date and certain other covenants (the “HOT Proceeds RCF Note” and, together with the HOT Proceeds Term
Note, the “HOT Proceeds Notes”). The HOT Proceeds RCF Note provides for a specified unused commitment
fee per annum which begins to accrue from March 15, 2019 and is payable on each interest payment date therein.
The HOT Proceeds RCF Note contains substantially similar terms as the HOT Proceeds Term Note except that,
in addition to the covenants contained in the HOT Proceeds Term Note, the HOT Proceeds RCF Note contains
one leverage based maintenance covenant. The HOT Proceeds RCF Note is guaranteed by the HOT Proceeds
Note Guarantors and secured by the same HOT Proceeds Note Collateral that secures the HOT Proceeds Term
Note.

**HOT Credit Facility**

On April 25, 2013, HOT entered into a facility agreement (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, the “HOT Credit Facility Agreement”) with Bank Hapoalim B.M., Israel Discount
Bank Ltd., and First International Bank of Israel Ltd. as lenders, extending a credit facility and a guarantee facility
for an aggregate principal amount of NIS 275 million. The maturity date of these facilities is September 12, 2021.
As of March 31, 2021, the aggregate principal amount of issued and outstanding guarantees under the HOT Credit
Facility Agreement was NIS 63 million.

**HOT Intercreditor Agreement**

On May 20, 2013, HOT entered into an intercreditor agreement (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, the “HOT Intercreditor Agreement”) with Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as the
HOT Security Agent, in order to establish the relative rights of certain of HOT’s creditors, including, without
limitation, Altice Financing in its capacity as the RCF Proceeds Note Creditor and the Proceeds Note Creditor,
certain Original Working Capital Creditors, Original Intercompany Creditors and Original Shareholders (each, as
defined therein). The HOT Intercreditor Agreement provides that future indebtedness may be incurred by HOT
and its subsidiaries subject to the terms of the HOT Intercreditor Agreement and each finance document with
respect to HOT then existing.

**_Ranking and Priority_**

The HOT Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain provisions, that the liabilities of each issuer, obligor
or borrower subject to the HOT Intercreditor Agreement (the “HOT **Obligors”) under or in respect of (i) certain**
HOT Super Priority Debt (which includes the HOT Proceeds RCF Note to the extent it is designated as super
priority debt) and HOT Pari Passu Debt (which includes the HOT Proceeds Note, HOT Proceeds RCF Note that
is not designated as super priority debt and HOT Credit Facility) (HOT Super Priority Debt together with HOT
_Pari Passu Debt, the “HOT Senior Secured Debt”) and (ii) certain intercompany debt and shareholder debt_
(collectively, the “HOT Subordinated Debt”) governed by the HOT Intercreditor Agreement will rank in right
and order of payment in the following order:


i. _first, the HOT Senior Secured Debt, pari passu without any preference among such debt;_


-----

ii. _second, the intercompany debt; and_


iii. _third, the shareholder debt._


The HOT Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security provided by the HOT Obligors shall only rank and
secure the HOT Senior Secured Debt. The HOT Subordinated Debt is unguaranteed and unsecured.

**_Enforcement Instructions_**

Until the discharge of the HOT Senior Secured Debt, the HOT Security Agent, acting on the instructions of the
relevant majority holders of the HOT Senior Secured Debt, may claim, enforce and prove for any debt owed by
the insolvent obligor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the HOT Intercreditor Agreement allows the holders of HOT
Subordinated Debt to take enforcement actions while any HOT Senior Secured Debt is outstanding if such action
is necessary to preserve the validity and existence of claims, but only where doing so would not conflict with any
other provisions of the HOT Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

Subject to the rights of any creditor with prior security or preferential claims, all amounts from time to time
received or recovered by the HOT Security Agent in connection with the realization or enforcement of security
shall be held by the HOT Security Agent on trust, in each case, to apply them in the following order:

        - first, in payment of the following amounts in the following order of priority: (i) firstly, to the
HOT Security Agent in respect of certain amounts payable to the HOT Security Agent and (ii)
secondly, _pari passu and pro rata (to the extent not included in (i) above) the fees, costs,_
expenses and liabilities (and all interest thereon as provided in the HOT Finance Documents) of
any receiver, attorney or agent appointed under the HOT Security Documents or the HOT
Intercreditor Agreement (to the extent such Security has been granted in favor of such
obligations);

        - second, in payment pari passu and pro rata of the balance of the costs and expenses of each
creditor of HOT Super Priority Debt in connection with such enforcement;

        - third, in payment _pari passu_ and pro rata to the creditors of HOT Super Priority Debt for
application towards the balance of the HOT Super Priority Debt;

        - fourth, in payment pari passu and pro rata of the balance of the costs and expenses of each
creditor of HOT Pari-Passu Debt in connection with such enforcement;

        - fifth, in payment pari passu and pro rata to the creditors of HOT Pari-Passu Debt for application
towards the balance of the obligations owing to the creditors of HOT Pari-Passu Debt;

        - sixth, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the Obligors or other person entitled to it.

**HOT Intercompany Loan Agreement**

On March 15, 2019, Altice Financing (as borrower) and HOT (as lender) entered into an intercompany master
loan agreement (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “HOT
**Intercompany Loan Agreement”), pursuant to which Altice Financing may borrow loans from time to time in**
accordance with the provisions of the agreement. The principal amount, interest payment date, interest rates and
the maturity date shall be agreed upon and determined by Altice Financing and HOT in a manner provided under
the HOT Intercompany Loan Agreement. As of March 31, 2021, pursuant to the HOT Intercompany Loan
Agreement, Altice Financing has borrowed a loan of an aggregate principal amount of NIS 395 million with an
interest of 5.6% per annum, payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, with maturity on February 15,
2023.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

_You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of Notes” under the heading_
_“Certain Definitions”. Certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of Notes” may have different_
_definitions to the same term used in other sections of this Offering Memorandum. For purposes of this_
_“Description of Notes”, references to the “Issuer” refer only to Altice Financing S.A._

Altice Financing S.A., a Luxembourg public limited liability company (société anonyme), with registered office
at 5, rue Eugène Ruppert, L-2453 Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (the “Issuer”) will be the issuer of
the Notes offered hereby. The Issuer is a wholly owned subsidiary of Altice Finco S.A., a Luxembourg public
limited liability company (société anonyme), with registered office at 5, rue Eugène Ruppert, L-2453 Luxembourg,
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (“HoldCo”).

The Issuer will issue $1,925 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2029
(the “Dollar Notes”) and €700 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2029
(the “Euro Notes” and, together with the Dollar Notes, the “Notes”) under an indenture (the “Indenture”), between,
_inter alios, itself, Altice International S.à r.l. (“Altice International”), a private limited liability company (société_
_a responsabilité limitée) incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, registered with the Luxembourg Register_
of Commerce and Companies under number B143.725, Cool Holding, Hadaros, Altice Holdings, Altice West
Europe, Altice Caribbean, Altice Bahamas, Altice Dominicana, Altice Portugal, PT Portugal and PT OpCo
(collectively, with Altice International, the “Initial Guarantors”, and each an “Intial _Guarantor”), Deutsche Bank_
Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as security agent (the
“Security Agent”). The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act.

The Issuer will use the net proceeds of the Notes as described in this Offering Memorandum under “Summary—
_The Offering” and “Use of Proceeds”._

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, but the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
issued in this offering is limited to $1,925 million aggregate principal amount of Dollar Notes and €700 million
aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes. We may issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Notes of
any series at later dates under the same Indenture (the “Additional Notes”); provided, however, that we will only
be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the
covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness”) and the Incurrence of Liens (as described below under “—Certain Covenants—_
_Limitation on Liens”). Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of Notes”, references to the_
“Notes” include the Notes and any Additional Notes that are actually issued. The Indenture will not be qualified
under, or incorporate by reference any of the provisions of, or be subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939,
as amended.

This “Description of Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and the Indenture,
and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents (each as defined herein). It does not restate
those agreements in their entirety. Since this “Description of Notes” is only a summary, you should refer to the
Indenture, the forms of Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents for complete descriptions
of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights because they, and not this summary, define your rights as holders
of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement
are available as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under “Available Information”. See the section entitled
“Description of Other _Indebtedness—The Intercreditor Agreement” in this Offering Memorandum for a summary_
of certain material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of such Note for all purposes. Only registered holders
will have rights under the Indenture.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

- be general obligations of the Issuer;


-----

- be guaranteed by the Guarantors and benefit from the security as set forth below under “—Notes Security”;

- rank _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not_
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including Indebtedness under the Existing Senior Secured
Notes, the Senior Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Facilities, the Guarantee Facilities and certain Hedging
Obligations;

- rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by property
and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
Indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness of Subsidiaries of Altice International that
are not Guarantors.

**_The Note Guarantees_**

Subject to the following paragraph, the Notes will be guaranteed (the “Note Guarantees”) by the Initial Guarantors;
_provided that (i) the Note Guarantee of PT Portugal, together with its guarantee of obligations under the Revolving_
Credit Facilities, the Guarantee Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Credit Facility, the
Existing Senior Notes, certain Hedging Obligations and certain future Indebtedness that may be incurred shall be
limited to €4,634.4 million; (ii) the Note Guarantee of PT OpCo, together with its guarantee of obligations under
the Revolving Credit Facilities, the Guarantee Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Credit
Facility, the Existing Senior Notes, certain Hedging Obligations and certain future Indebtedness that may be
incurred shall be limited to €968.4 million; and (iii) the Note Guarantee of Altice Portugal, together with its
guarantees of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facilities, the Guarantee Facilities, the Existing Senior
Secured Notes, the Senior Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Notes, certain Hedging Obligations and certain
future Indebtedness that may be incurred shall be limited to €95 million. None of HOT or any of its Subsidiaries
will guarantee the Notes. See “Simplified Corporate and Financing Structure”.

Each Note Guarantee of the Notes will:

- be a general obligation of the relevant Guarantor;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not
subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, including such Guarantor’s Guarantee
of the Issuer’s Indebtedness under the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Credit Facility, the
Revolving Credit Facilities, the Guarantee Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations;

- rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of that Guarantor that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;

- benefit from the security as set forth below under “—Notes Security”;

- be effectively subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is secured by liens
on property or assets that do not secure that Guarantor’s guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property
or assets securing such Indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to the Indebtedness and the other obligations of Subsidiaries of Altice
International that do not Guarantee the Notes.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the
relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect
limitations under applicable law or capital maintenance regulations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Notes and the Structure—Each Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited_


-----

_by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability” and “Limitation on_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests”._

The Notes will not benefit from a direct guarantee from HOT or any of its Subsidiaries. However, as a
result of the pledge of the HOT Proceeds Note, the Notes will indirectly benefit from the HOT Proceeds Note and
the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees by the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantors. See “Description of Notes—The
_Issuer Proceeds Loans” and “Description of Notes—The HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees”._

Each of Altice International, Cool Holding, Hadaros, Altice Holdings, Altice West Europe, Altice Caribbean,
Altice Portugal and Altice Bahamas is a holding company and does not conduct any operations and is wholly
dependent on payments from its respective Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including under its Note Guarantee
and any Issuer Proceeds Loan to which it is a party.

**Principal and Maturity**

The Issuer will issue $1,925 million aggregate principal amount of Dollar Notes and €700 million aggregate
principal amount of Euro Notes on the Issue Date. The Notes will mature on August 15, 2029, at which time 100%
of the principal amount of the Notes shall be payable, unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein.

The Issuer may issue an unlimited principal amount of Additional Notes of any series; provided, however, that
the Issuer will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the
Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below under “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”) and the Incurrence of Liens (as described below under “—_
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”). The Notes issued in this offering and, if issued, any Additional Notes,_
will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to
waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise stated in the Indenture. However,
in order for any Additional Notes of any series to have the same CUSIP number and ISIN as the corresponding
Notes, such Additional Notes must be fungible with such Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The Dollar Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof, and the Euro Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof. Any non-compliance with such minimum denomination requirement shall not be the
responsibility of the Issuer and investors are urged to seek their own independent legal and financial advice as to
the consequences of holding Notes in minimum denominations of less than €100,000 or $200,000, as applicable.

**Interest**

Interest on the Dollar Notes will accrue at the rate of 5.750% per annum and interest on the Euro Notes will accrue

recently paid;

- be payable in cash semi-annually in arrear on each February 15 and August 15, commencing on February 15,
2022;

- be payable, so long as the Notes are Global Notes (as defined under “—Transfer and Exchange”), to the

“—Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes”) have been issued to the holder of record of such Notes on
February 1 and August 1 immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and

- be computed on the aggregate principal amount outstanding on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of
twelve 30-day months.

Interest on overdue principal and interest, including Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, will accrue
at a rate that is 1% higher than the interest rate on the Notes.


-----

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day, the Holder thereof will not be
entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day, and will not be entitled to any
further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, interest and premium, if any, on the Global Notes will be payable at the specified office or agency of
one or more Paying Agents; provided that payments on the Global Notes will be made to the Paying Agents,

thereof to the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the Registrar, any Paying Agents or Transfer Agents for the Notes without prior notice to

collectively referred to as the “Euro Global Notes” herein.

During the 40-day “distribution compliance period” (as such term is defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S under
the Securities Act), the Dollar Regulation S Global Notes will initially be credited within DTC for the accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream. After the 40-day distribution compliance period ends, investors may also hold their
interests in the permanent Dollar Regulation S Global Note through organizations other than Clearstream or
Euroclear that are DTC participants.

During the 40-day distribution compliance period, book-entry interests (“Book-Entry Interests”) in the Regulation
S Global Notes may be (1) held only through Euroclear and Clearstream (including, with respect to the Dollar
Regulation S Global Notes, as indirect participants in DTC) and (2) transferred only to non-U.S. persons under
Regulation S or qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A. After the 40-day distribution compliance period,
Book-Entry Interests in the applicable Regulation S Global Notes may also be held through organizations other
than Euroclear or Clearstream that are participants in Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable. Ownership
of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions” in this
Offering Memorandum. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear,
participants in Clearstream or participants in DTC will be effected by Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as
applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by
Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by
the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is
being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by
the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is
being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the
meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with
the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” in this Offering Memorandum and in accordance
with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the applicable Global Note from which it was transferred and will
become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other
procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the applicable Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of, in the case of
the Euro Notes, €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and, in the case of the Dollar Notes,
$200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the relevant Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It
is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as


-----

applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued
in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the
Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions
on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions” in this Offering
Memorandum.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, the Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of, in the case of Euro Notes, €100,000
and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and, in the case of Dollar Notes $200,000 and in integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require
the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as
applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and governmental charges in
connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to such
Holder, other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents and the Registrars will be entitled to treat the
registered holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**The Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be Guaranteed by the Initial Guarantors (each an “Initial _Guarantee”) and each_
such Note Guarantee shall be granted on a senior basis for the full and punctual payment when due, whether at
Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all payment obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the
Notes, whether for payment of principal of or interest on or in respect of such Notes, fees, expenses,
indemnification or otherwise. The Note Guarantees of Altice Portugal together with its guarantees of obligations
under the Revolving Credit Facilities, the Guarantee Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior
Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Notes, certain Hedging Obligations and certain future Indebtedness that may
be incurred shall be limited to €95 million. The Note Guarantee of PT Portugal, together with its guarantee of
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facilities, the Guarantee Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the
Senior Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Notes, certain Hedging Obligations and certain future Indebtedness
that may be incurred shall be limited to €4,634.4 million. The Note Guarantee of PT OpCo, together with its
guarantee of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facilities, the Guarantee Facilities, the Existing Senior
Secured Notes, the Senior Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Notes, certain Hedging Obligations and certain
future Indebtedness that may be incurred shall be limited to €968.4 million.

On the Issue Date, the Notes will not benefit from a direct guarantee from HOT or any of its Subsidiaries.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee are or will be, as applicable, contractually limited
under the applicable guarantees to reflect limitations under applicable law, including with respect to maintenance
of share capital applicable to such Guarantor and its shareholders, directors and general partners. See “Limitation
_on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests”._

The Issuer is a special purpose finance vehicle and does not conduct, and will be prohibited by the Indenture from
engaging in, any operations, subject to certain exceptions. Upon completion of the Transactions, the Issuer’s only
assets will be the Issuer Proceeds Loans and cash in its bank accounts. As a result, the Issuer is wholly dependent
on payments from Altice International and the other Restricted Subsidiaries, including payments made by the


-----

borrowers under the Issuer Proceeds Loans, to fund its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes, to
the extent it does not otherwise have funds available to it.

The operations of each of Altice International and each of the other Guarantors that are holding companies are
conducted through their respective Subsidiaries and, therefore, each of Altice International and such other
Guarantors depend on the cash flow of their respective Subsidiaries to meet their respective obligations, including
their obligations under Note Guarantees and the Issuer Proceeds Loans to which they are a party. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—Altice International and certain of the other Guarantors_
_are holding companies and conduct no business of their own and will depend on payments from their direct and_
_indirect subsidiaries to provide them with funds to meet their obligations under the Guarantees”._

The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and
other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of Subsidiaries of Altice
International that do not Guarantee the Notes. Any right of the Issuer or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of
the Subsidiaries of Altice International that do not Guarantee the Notes upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s
liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Notes to participate in those assets)
will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent
that the Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case
the claims of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinate in right of payment to
any security in the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the non-guarantor Subsidiary
senior to that held by the Issuer or such Guarantor.

**_Additional Note Guarantees_**

Altice International may from time to time designate a Restricted Subsidiary as an additional guarantor of the
Notes (each, an “Additional Guarantor” and collectively with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”) by causing
it to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture (and with
such documentation relating thereto as the Trustee may reasonably require, including an Opinion of Counsel as
to the enforceability of such Note Guarantee), pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will become a
Guarantor.

Each Additional Guarantor will, jointly and severally, with the Initial Guarantors and each other Additional
Guarantor, irrevocably guarantee (each guarantee, an “Additional Guarantee”) on a senior basis the full and
punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all payment obligations
of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of or interest on or in respect of
the Notes, fees, expenses, indemnification or otherwise. The obligations of any Additional Guarantor will be
contractually limited under its Additional Guarantee to reflect limitations under applicable law, including, among
other things, with respect to maintenance of share capital applicable to such Additional Guarantor and its
shareholders, directors and general partner. Subject to the foregoing, any Additional Guarantee issued by a
Restricted Subsidiary shall be issued on substantially the same terms as the Note Guarantees of the Restricted
Subsidiaries that will become Initial Guarantors on the Issue Date. For purposes of the Indenture and this
“Description of Notes”, references to the Note Guarantees include references to the Initial Guarantees and any
Additional Guarantees and references to the Guarantors include references to the Initial Guarantors and any
Additional Guarantors.

**_Releases of the Note Guarantees_**

The Note Guarantee of Altice International may be released:

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, as provided in “—
_Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

- in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

- if Altice International is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant consolidation or merger, as a
result of a transaction that complies with the provisions described under “—Merger and Consolidation—
_Altice International”; or_


-----

- upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the
Notes.

The Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will terminate automatically:

- upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger, amalgamation or combination)
of the Capital Stock of the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company
of such Subsidiary Guarantor) or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Subsidiary
Guarantor (other than to Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of
_Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;_

- (i) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of that Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary or (ii) such Subsidiary Guarantor otherwise becomes an Excluded Subsidiary (other than pursuant
to clause (1) of the definition thereof);

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, as provided under
“—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

- in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

- as described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantors”;

- with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor that is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant
consolidation or merger, as a result of a transaction that complies with the provisions described under “—
_Merger and Consolidation—The Subsidiary Guarantors”;_

- upon a solvent liquidation or dissolution of such Subsidiary Guarantor, provided no Default or Event of
Default is continuing; or

- upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the
Notes.

The Trustee and the Security Agent (as applicable) shall each take all necessary actions requested by the Issuer,
including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to
customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effective without the
consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Issuer will be required
to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

**Notes Security**

**_General_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the immediately following paragraph, the Notes will be secured by:

- share pledges over all of the Capital Stock of the Issuer and the Initial Guarantors (other than Altice
International (with the share pledge over the share capital of Altice Dominicana becoming effective upon
approval of Indotel));

- a pledge over the bank accounts and all receivables of the Issuer, including the Issuer Proceeds Loans;

- a pledge over substantially all of the material assets of each of the Initial Guarantors (other than Altice
Portugal, PT Portugal and PT OpCo), including over the bank accounts, receivables and share pledges over
direct Restricted Subsidiaries (including all of the Capital Stock of HOT); provided that, to the extent fair
market value of a real estate asset owned by Altice Dominicana is less than €5 million, such real estate asset


-----

shall be excluded from the relevant pledge; provided further that the pledge granted by Altice Dominicana
shall only be effective upon approval of Indotel;

- a pledge over the HoldCo Proceeds Loans;

- a pledge over the Cool Shareholder Loan; and

- pledges over all of the Capital Stock of PT Cloud e Data Centers, S.A. (“PT Cloud”), and PT Móveis Serviços
de Telecomunicações, SGPS, S.A. (“PT Móveis”) and an assignment of all of Altice Portugal’s rights under
the acquisition agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of PT Portugal,

(collectively, the “Notes Collateral”).

In the event the Issuer or the relevant grantor of security is required to enter into new or amended Security
Documents in order to provide security for its obligations under the Notes or the Note Guarantees, as applicable,
as described herein, such Security Documents will be entered into within 30 Business Days after the Issue Date.

The Notes Collateral will also secure Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facilities, the Existing Senior
Secured Notes, the Senior Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations. The pledge
agreements and the other security documents, as amended and/or restated, modified or replaced from time to time,
in respect of the Notes Collateral are referred to as the “Security Documents”. Any other additional security
interests that may in the future be granted to secure the obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the
Indenture would also constitute Notes Collateral. Other than pursuant to the HOT Proceeds Note, Altice
International has only a shareholder’s claim over the assets of HOT and its Subsidiaries, which are junior to the
claims that creditors of HOT and its Subsidiaries have against HOT and such Subsidiaries. Holders of the Notes
will only be creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors and will not have any direct claim on the cash flows or
assets of HOT and its Subsidiaries, and none of HOT and its Subsidiaries will have any obligation, contingent or
otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes or the Note Guarantees or to make funds available to the Issuer or
the Guarantors for those payments (other than their respective obligations to pay certain amounts due to the Issuer
under the HOT Proceeds Note).

The assets of Altice Portugal, PT Portugal and PT OpCo will secure the Notes subject to the applicable Aggregate
Portuguese Security and Guarantee Limit Amount.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interests”, Altice International and its_
Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to incur certain additional Indebtedness in the future that may be secured
by the Notes Collateral, including any Additional Notes, certain Indebtedness under Credit Facilities (including
revolving credit facility Indebtedness which may be Super Priority Indebtedness) and Hedging Obligations (which
in the case of Interest Rate Agreements and Currency Agreements may be Super Priority Indebtedness) and certain
other Hedging Obligations (which may be Super Priority Indebtedness), in each case, permitted under the
Indenture and other Indebtedness of Altice International and its Subsidiaries. In addition, subject to certain
conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”
and “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interests”, HOT and its Restricted Subsidiaries are permitted
to incur certain additional Indebtedness in the future that may be secured on the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral.

The proceeds from the sale of the Notes Collateral remaining after sharing with other creditors entitled to share in
such proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders of the Notes. No appraisals of
the Notes Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of Notes. By its nature, some or all of the
Notes Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In addition, (i) certain Liens
over the Notes Collateral may not be enforced without the prior consent of the Israeli Minister of Communications,
including the Liens over the Capital Stock of HOT and Cool Holding and (ii) the share pledge over the share
capital of Altice Dominicana and the pledges granted by Altice Dominicana only become effective after approval
from Indotel. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. In
addition, the Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to release the security
interests in some of the Notes Collateral, by reference to the interests of other creditors. These limitations may
include requirements that some or all of the Notes Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or
only at a price confirmed by a valuation. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—The Intercreditor Agreement”
and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—The value of the Senior Secured Collateral
_may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Senior Secured Collateral may be reduced_


-----

_or diluted under certain circumstances, which may be time consuming and cumbersome, and certain Senior_
_Secured Collateral and Guarantees will be limited to a specified maximum amount”. Certain Collateral and_
Guarantees will be limited to a specified maximum amount.

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facilities, the trustee under the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures,
the creditors under the Senior Credit Facility, and the Guarantee Facilities, the counterparties to certain Hedging
Obligations and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably
appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent and security agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents. The creditors under Revolving Credit Facilities, the trustee under the Existing Senior
Secured Notes Indentures, the creditors under the Senior Credit Facility and the Guarantee Facilities,
counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each holder will be
deemed to have, irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers
and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents,
together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver,
modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the applicable grantor of security has granted or will grant security over the Notes
Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and/or the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the
Notes, the Note Guarantees and/or the Indenture (as applicable). The Security Documents have been or will be
entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties referred to
therein. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent has acted and will act in its own name,
but also (except where the Security Documents only secure the “parallel debt” created under the Intercreditor
Agreement and owed to such Security Agent) as a representative of the secured parties (including the Holders
from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the holders
of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Existing Senior Notes, the lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facilities, the Senior Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facilities, the counterparties under certain Hedging
Obligations, and holders of any additional Indebtedness that is permitted to be secured by the Notes Collateral in
favor of such parties.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof, and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, as applicable, will be secured by the security interest in the Notes
Collateral that is created by the Security Documents and/or by virtue of the Intercreditor Agreement and secures
obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and/or the Indenture (the “Security Interests”). Such Security
Interests in the Notes Collateral will also secure the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facilities, the Existing
Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facilities, the counterparties to certain Hedging
Obligations and certain other Indebtedness permitted by the Indenture to be Incurred in the future and secured by
such Notes Collateral. However, the Security Interests may be released under certain circumstances as provided
under “—Release of Note Collateral” below. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—
_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Senior Secured_
_Collateral and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Security_
_Agent or Trustee”._

The Security Documents provide that the rights with respect to the Notes Collateral must be exercised by the
Security Agent. Because the Holders will not be a party to the Security Documents, Holders may not, individually
or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents and may
only act through the Security Agent in accordance with the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement.

In the event that Altice International, a Subsidiary of Altice International or other grantor of a security interest in
the Notes Collateral enters into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under
the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject
to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement were successful, the Holders might not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—Each Guarantee will be subject to certain
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its_
_validity and enforceability” and “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests”._


-----

**_Release of Notes Collateral_**

The Issuer and the Guarantors will be entitled to release the Security Interests in respect of the Notes Collateral
securing the Notes, and the Note Guarantees under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of the Notes Collateral (other than the pledge over all of
the Capital Stock of the Issuer (the “Issuer Share Pledge”)) to a Person that is not Altice International or
a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—_
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”, but only in respect of the Notes_
Collateral sold or otherwise disposed of;

(2) in connection with the release of a Guarantor from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) if Altice International designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and
Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer Share Pledge and the pledges over
the HoldCo Proceeds Loans);

(4) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, as provided
in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (see
“Description of Other Indebtedness—The Intercreditor Agreement—Restrictions on Enforcement”);

(6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”, “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interests” and the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;_

(7) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and
the Notes;

(8) to release and re-take any Lien on any Notes Collateral to the extent not otherwise prohibited by the
terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(9) in connection with a transaction permitted by the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;_

(10) with the consent of holders of at least 75% in aggregate principal amount of Notes (including, without
limitation, consent obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the
Notes); or

(11) with respect to any Notes Collateral that is transferred to a Receivables Subsidiary pursuant to a Qualified
Receivables Financing, and with respect to any Securitization Asset that is transferred in one or more
transactions, to a Receivables Subsidiary pursuant to a Qualified Receivables Financing, but only in
respect of the Notes Collateral so transferred.

Upon certification by the Issuer, the Trustee (to the extent action is required by it) and the Security Agent shall
take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement, to
effectuate any release in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.
The Security Agent and the Trustee (as applicable) will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release
of the Notes Collateral, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall
be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee.

**The Issuer Proceeds Loans**

The Issuer has made or will make Issuer Proceeds Loans to certain Guarantors and HOT (comprising of the HOT
Proceeds Note).


-----

Each Issuer Proceeds Loan, as may be amended in connection with the Transactions, has been or will be assigned
as Notes Collateral to secure the Obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees.

The Notes are not Guaranteed by HOT or any of its Subsidiaries. Upon an event of default under the Notes, HOT
and its Subsidiaries shall not be liable in any way, including by way of cross default, and shall not be required to
repay any amounts outstanding, any repayment premiums or accrued and unpaid interest thereon, under the Notes.
Further, the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantors will only guarantee HOT’s obligations under the HOT Proceeds Note.
The HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees will be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the outstanding HOT
Proceeds Note, which may vary from time to time in accordance with the terms of the HOT Proceeds Note. The
HOT Proceeds Notes comprises of (i) a note issued by HOT in an aggregate principal amount of approximately
NIS 1,900 million (€484 million equivalent as of March 31, 2021) and (ii) a revolving note facility in an aggregate
principal amount of NIS 275 million (€70 million equivalent as of March 31, 2021). Holders of the Notes will
only be able to seek remedies against the HOT Proceeds Note Obligors in the event of an event of default under
the applicable HOT Proceeds Note, in each case, indirectly as a result of the assignment of the applicable HOT
Proceeds Note and/or the ability of the holders of the Notes to direct the actions of the Issuer in connection with
the applicable HOT Proceeds Note in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent
permitted thereby.

The HOT Proceeds Note will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other
liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of HOT’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries
(including the bank guarantee in an amount of NIS 22 million provided by HOT Mobile to the State of Israel that
is secured by a pledge of all of the assets of HOT Mobile). Any right of the Issuer to receive assets of any of
HOT’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization (and the
consequent indirect right of the holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated
to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer is itself recognized
as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer would still be subordinate in
right of payment to any security in the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary.

Only the security agent under the HOT Proceeds Note will be able to enforce the security interests in the HOT
Proceeds Note Collateral at a time that an event of default under the applicable HOT Proceeds Note is continuing.
As a result, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes will not have
the right to enforce such security interests in the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral and, subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement, will only have the right to enforce the first-ranking pledge over the HOT Proceeds Note. The Holders
of the Notes must then rely on the ability of the Issuer to enforce its rights under the HOT Proceeds Note upon an
event of default thereunder in order to access the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral. An Event of Default will not
trigger an event of default under the HOT Proceeds Note.

**The HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

The HOT Proceeds Note will be guaranteed by the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantors on a senior basis for the full
and punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise of, all payment
obligations of the HOT under the HOT Proceeds Note, whether for payment of principal of or interest on or in
respect of the HOT Proceeds Note, fees, expenses, indemnification or otherwise.

The obligations of each HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor under its HOT Proceeds Note Guarantee are contractually
limited under the applicable guarantees to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of
share capital applicable to such HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor and its shareholders, directors and general partners.
See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests”.

_Additional HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees_

HOT may from time to time designate a Restricted Subsidiary of HOT as an additional guarantor of the HOT
Proceeds Note, and each such additional HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor will, jointly and severally, with the other
HOT Proceeds Note Guarantors, irrevocably guarantee on a senior basis the full and punctual payment when due,
whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all payment obligations of HOT under the HOT
Proceeds Note, whether for payment of principal of or interest on or in respect of the HOT Proceeds Note, fees,
expenses, indemnification or otherwise. The obligations of any such additional HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor


-----

will be contractually limited under its guarantee to reflect limitations under applicable law, including, among other
things, with respect to maintenance of share capital applicable to such additional HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor
and its shareholders, directors and general partner.

**_Releases of the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees_**

The HOT Proceeds Note Guarantee of a HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor may be released:

- upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger, amalgamation or combination)
of the Capital Stock of the relevant HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding
company of such HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor) or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets
of the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor (other than to the Issuer, Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary),
in each case if the sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;_

of Default is continuing; or

- upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of HOT under the HOT Proceeds Note.

**HOT Proceeds Note Security**

**_General_**

The HOT Proceeds Note and the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees will be secured by Liens over substantially all
of HOT’s and the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor’s assets but excluding (a) the licenses issued by the Israeli
Ministry of Communications, which are not assignable as a matter of law, and (b) certain end-user equipment. In
addition, the HOT Proceeds Note and the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees are secured by first ranking security
interests over all of the Capital Stock of each HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor. The foregoing property and assets
subject to such security interests are referred to herein as the “HOT Proceeds Note Collateral”. Any other
additional security interests that may in the future be granted to secure the HOT Proceeds Note and the HOT
Proceeds Note Guarantees would also constitute HOT Proceeds Note Collateral. The rights of the Issuer as lender
under the HOT Proceeds Note, including with respect to the enforcement of the HOT Proceeds Notes Collateral,
are subject to the HOT Intercreditor Agreement. For further details, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_HOT Intercreditor Agreement”._

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interests”, HOT and its Restricted_
Subsidiaries are permitted to incur certain additional Indebtedness in the future that may be secured on the HOT
Proceeds Note Collateral.


-----

The proceeds from the sale of the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral remaining after sharing with other creditors
entitled to share in such proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Issuer as a lender
under the HOT Proceeds Note. No appraisals of the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral have been made in connection
with this offering of Notes or the offering of the Existing Senior Secured Notes. By its nature, some or all of the
HOT Proceeds Note Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In addition,
certain Liens over the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral may not be enforced without the prior consent of the Israeli
Ministry of Communications. Accordingly, the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral may not be able to be sold in a
short period of time, or at all. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the
Security Agent to release the security interests in some of the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral, by reference to the
interests of other creditors. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the HOT Proceeds Note
Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—The Intercreditor Agreement” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Notes and the Structure—The value of the Senior Secured Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy our_
_obligations under the Notes and such Senior Secured Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain_
_circumstances, which may be time consuming and cumbersome, and certain Senior Secured Collateral and_
_Guarantees will be limited to a specified maximum amount”. In addition, the HOT Proceeds Notes Collateral is_
subject to the terms of the HOT Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—HOT
_Intercreditor Agreement”._

**_HOT Security Documents_**

Under the HOT Security Documents, the HOT Proceeds Note Obligors will grant security over the HOT Proceeds
Note Collateral to secure the payment when due of HOT’s and the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantors’ payment
obligations under the HOT Proceeds Note and the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees. The HOT Security Documents
will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties
referred to therein.

The HOT Proceeds Note provides and the Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the HOT
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the HOT Proceeds Note and the HOT Proceeds Note
Guarantees, as applicable, will be secured by the security interest in the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral that is
created by the HOT Security Documents and secures obligations under the HOT Proceeds Note or the HOT
Proceeds Note Guarantees (the “HOT Proceeds Note Security Interest”). Such HOT Proceeds Note Security
Interests in the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral may also secure certain other Indebtedness permitted by the
Indenture and the HOT Proceeds Note to be Incurred in the future and secured by the HOT Proceeds Note
Collateral. However, the HOT Proceeds Note Security Interests may be released under certain circumstances as
provided under “—Release of HOT Proceeds Note Collateral” below. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Notes and the Structure—There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which_
_the Senior Secured Collateral and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the_
_consent of the Security Agent or Trustee”._

**_Release of HOT Proceeds Note Collateral_**

The HOT Proceeds Note Obligors will be entitled to release the HOT Proceeds Note Security Interests in respect
of the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral to a Person that is
not HOT or a Restricted Subsidiary of HOT or, to the extent after such sale or other disposition such
assets are pledged to secure the obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture,
Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary of Altice International (but excluding any transaction
subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not
violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock”, but only in respect of the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral sold or otherwise disposed_
of;

(2) in connection with the release of a HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor from its HOT Proceeds Note Guarantee
pursuant to the terms of the HOT Proceeds Note, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock,
of such HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor;


-----

(3) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary of HOT to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property, assets and Capital Stock of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(4) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, as provided
in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”, “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interests” and the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;_

(6) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of HOT under the HOT Proceeds
Note;

(7) to release and re-take any Lien on any HOT Proceeds Note Collateral to the extent not otherwise
prohibited by the terms of the HOT Proceeds Note and the HOT Security Documents;

(8) in connection with a transaction permitted by the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;_

(9) with the consent of holders of at least 75% in aggregate principal amount of Notes (including, without
limitation, consent obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the
Notes); or

(10) with respect to any HOT Proceeds Note Collateral that is transferred to a Receivables Subsidiary pursuant
to a Qualified Receivables Financing, and with respect to any Securitization Asset that is transferred in
one or more transactions, to a Receivables Subsidiary pursuant to a Qualified Receivables Financing, but
only in respect of the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral so transferred.

In addition, all of the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral may be release in connection with the HOT Direct Obligation
Event, described below under “—Direct Obligation Events”.

**_Direct Obligation Events_**

Altice International may at any time elect to cause the HOT Proceeds Note Obligors to become direct Guarantors
of the Notes by causing each of them to execute and deliver a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the
Indenture pursuant to which HOT and each HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor will provide a Note Guarantee on a
senior basis in an amount equal to or greater than the HOT Proceeds Note and the Guarantees thereof as of the
date of such HOT Direct Obligation Event. Concurrently with the granting of such Note Guarantee, HOT and
each HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor will grant an equivalent Lien over all of its assets that constitute HOT
Proceeds Note Collateral on such date. In connection therewith, the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees and the HOT
Proceeds Note Collateral will be released, provided that no Default or Event of Default is outstanding or would
result from any of the foregoing (collectively, the “HOT Direct Obligation Event”).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

To establish the relative rights of certain creditors of the Group under its financing arrangements, including,
without limitation, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facilities, the lenders under the Guarantee Facilities,
the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility, the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations secured on the
Notes Collateral, the trustee and the holders of notes under the indentures governing the Existing Senior Secured
Notes and the trustee and the holders of notes under the indentures governing the Existing Senior Notes, Altice
International and the Guarantors, the agents under the Revolving Credit Facilities, the agent under the Guarantee
Facilities, the agents under the Senior Credit Facility, the trustee under the indentures governing the Existing
Senior Secured Notes, the trustee under the indentures governing the Existing Senior Notes, and certain hedging
counterparties and the Security Agent entered into or acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement. Please see
“Description of Other Indebtedness—The _Intercreditor Agreement”. On the Issue Date, the Trustee (in its capacity_
as representative of the Holders of the Notes) will become party to the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the 2015 Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations that are permitted to be secured on the Notes Collateral
(see “Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens”) and any other Indebtedness of the Issuer and the
Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Notes Collateral on a super-priority basis will receive


-----

priority over amounts received from the sale of the Notes Collateral pursuant to an enforcement sale or other
distressed disposal of such Notes Collateral pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. Any proceeds received upon
any enforcement over any Notes Collateral, after all obligations under the 2015 Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facilities have been repaid and such Hedging Obligations have been discharged from such recoveries, will be
applied pro rata in repayment of all obligations under the Indenture, the Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Notes,
the Senior Credit Facility, the Guarantee Facilities, and the 2014 Pari Passu Revolving Credit Facility and any
other Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Note Collateral
on a senior basis pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to the Security Interest becoming enforceable, the Holders of the Notes (together with any other holders
of senior secured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors that is not Super Priority Indebtedness) and the
holders of Super Priority Indebtedness, in each case acting through their respective agent or trustee, are entitled
to instruct the Security Agent on enforcement of the Notes Collateral. In the event either group of creditors issues
conflicting enforcement instructions, subject to certain exceptions, a 30-day consultation period is required. In the
event both creditor groups do not agree on the manner of enforcement after the consultation period, the
Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will act on the instructions of an “instructing group”
consisting of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and all other senior secured indebtedness
(except Super Priority Indebtedness) of the Issuer and the Guarantors then outstanding. If all Super Priority
Indebtedness is not repaid within six months after date on which either creditor group issues proposed enforcement
instructions or the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action within three months of such date,
thereafter instructions of the majority holders of Super Priority Indebtedness will prevail. See “Description of
_Other Indebtedness—The Intercreditor Agreement”._

The Indenture will also provide that each holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein).

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to Be Bound_**

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements”._

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted
the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and to have
authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Intercreditor Agreement or any such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the
provisions described herein).

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all of Altice International’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries other than HoldCo and
Auberimmo SAS. However, in the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted
_Subsidiary”, Altice International will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted_
Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to many of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

**Optional Redemption**

**_Dollar Notes_**

Except as described below and except as described under “Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes”, the
Dollar Notes are not redeemable until August 15, 2024. On and after August 15, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all
or, from time to time, part of the Dollar Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the following
redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of the Dollar Notes) plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date

Prior to August 15, 2024, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the original principal
amount of the Dollar Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes of such series), upon not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds
of one or more Equity Offerings, at a redemption price of 105.750% of the principal amount of the Dollar Notes
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable
redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 60% of the original principal amount of the Dollar Notes (including the principal amount of any
Additional Notes of such series), remains outstanding after each such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

Any redemption notice given in respect of the redemption referred to in the preceding paragraph may be given
prior to completion of the related Equity Offering.

At any time prior to August 15, 2024, the Issuer may also redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Dollar
Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to,
but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_Euro Notes_**

Except as described below and except as described under “Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes”, the
Euro Notes are not redeemable until August 15, 2024. On and after August 15, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all
or, from time to time, part of the Euro Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the following
redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of the Euro Notes) plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date
(subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on August 15 of the years indicated
below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**

2024 ........................................................................................................................................................ 102.125%
2025 ........................................................................................................................................................ 101.063%
2026 and thereafter ................................................................................................................................ 100.000%

Prior to August 15, 2024, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the original principal
amount of the Euro Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes of such series), upon not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds
of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of 104.250% of the principal amount of the Euro Notes
redeemed, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including,
the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 60% of the original principal amount of the Euro Notes (including the principal amount of any
Additional Notes of such series), remains outstanding after each such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

Any redemption notice given in respect of the redemption referred to in the preceding paragraph may be given
prior to completion of the related Equity Offering.


-----

At any time prior to August 15, 2024, the Issuer may also redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Euro Notes
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_General_**

If a redemption date is not a Business Day, payment may be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business
Day, and no interest shall accrue on any amount that would have been otherwise payable on such redemption date
if it were a Business Day for the intervening period.

For the avoidance of doubt, in each case above, the Issuer may choose to redeem the Dollar Notes or the Euro
Notes, either together or separately.

In connection with any tender offer or other offer to purchase (including a Change of Control Offer) for all of the
Dollar Notes or the Euro Notes, as applicable, if Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount
of the then outstanding Dollar Notes or Euro Notes, as applicable, validly tender and do not validly withdraw such
Dollar Notes or Euro Notes, as applicable, in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such
tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Dollar Notes or the Euro Notes, as applicable, validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, all of the Holders of the relevant series of Notes will be deemed to
have consented to such tender or other offer and, accordingly, the Issuer or such third party will have the right
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice following such purchase date, to redeem all Dollar Notes or
Euro Notes, as applicable, that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to
each other Holder in such tender offer (other than any incentive payment for early tenders), plus, to the extent not
included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but not including, the
repurchase date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Dollar Notes or Euro Notes, as applicable, have validly tendered and not
withdrawn Dollar Notes or Euro Notes, as applicable, in a tender offer or other offer to purchase for all of the
Dollar Notes or Euro Notes, as applicable, Dollar Notes or Euro Notes, as applicable, owned by an affiliate of the
Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed
to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other offer, as applicable.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Dollar Notes
or the Euro Notes, as applicable, or the portion thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

Any redemption notice given in respect of the redemption of the Dollar Notes or the Euro Notes, as applicable
(including upon an Equity Offering or in connection with a transaction (or series of related transactions) or an
event that constitutes a Change of Control) may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, the completion or occurrence of the relevant transaction,
as the case may be. In addition, if such redemption or purchase is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s
discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the
notice of redemption was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions
shall be satisfied or waived, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in
the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date as so delayed, or such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s discretion if in the good
faith judgment of the Issuer any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied. In addition, the Issuer may provide
in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to
such redemption may be performed by another Person. In no event shall the Trustee be responsible for monitoring,
or charged with knowledge of, the maximum aggregate amount of the Dollar Notes or the Euro Notes, as
applicable, eligible under the Indenture to be redeemed.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Dollar Notes or Euro Notes, as applicable, it will, for so long as the
Dollar Notes or the Euro Notes, as applicable, are listed on the Exchange and the rules and regulations of the
Exchange so require, inform the Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal
amount of the Dollar Notes or the Euro Notes, as applicable, that will remain outstanding immediately after such
redemption.


-----

As market conditions warrant, we, our equity holders and those who directly or indirectly control us, including
the Investor, Investor Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time seek to purchase our
outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Dollar Notes or the Euro Notes, as applicable, in privately
negotiated or open-market purchases, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained
in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, any purchases made by us may be funded
by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings
under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the
aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class
or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the applicable series of Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Notes for redemption will be
selected in accordance with the procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, or if DTC Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable, prescribes no method of selection, the Issuer will instruct the relevant Paying Agent
or the relevant Registrar to select the Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal
securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, or if the Notes are not so listed or such exchange
prescribes no method of selection, based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection or by lot;
_provided, however, that no Dollar Note of $200,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in_
part and only Dollar Notes in integral multiples of $1,000 will be redeemed and no Euro Note of €100,000 in
aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Euro Notes in integral multiples of €1,000
will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee nor the Registrars will be liable for any selections made in accordance with
this paragraph.

Not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the Issuer will (if such Notes are in certificated
form) mail notice of redemption to Holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as
they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. If such Notes are in global form, notice of redemption will
be delivered to DTC (in the case of the Dollar Notes) and to Euroclear and Clearstream (in the case of the Euro
Notes) for communication to entitled account holders.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive
Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed
in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered
Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal
amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable
redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the
redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

**Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes**

The Issuer may redeem the applicable series of Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon
giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the holders of such series of Notes (which notice
will be irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described in “—Selection and Notice”), at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and all Additional
Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption
or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of such Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which
any amount would be payable in respect of such Notes, the Issuer or any Guarantor is or would be required to pay
Additional Amounts, and (a) the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor cannot avoid such requirement by taking
reasonable measures available to it (including the designation of a different Paying Agent), (b) in the case of a
Guarantor, such amounts cannot be paid by the Issuer or any other Guarantor who in turn can pay such amounts
without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts and (c) the requirement arises as a result of:


-----

(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction (as defined in “—Withholding Taxes” below) which change or
amendment is announced and becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax
Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date); or

(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or application of such laws, treaties,
regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent
jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which amendment or change is announced
and becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax
Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date).

The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the
Issuer or the relevant Guarantor would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect
of such Notes were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such
notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of such Notes
pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel to the effect
that there has been such amendment or change which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. In
addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver
to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that (a) it or the relevant Guarantor cannot avoid its obligation
to pay Additional Amounts by the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor taking reasonable measures available to it and
(b) in the case of a Guarantor, the amounts giving rise to such obligation cannot be paid by the Issuer or any other
Guarantor without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts.

In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to conclusively rely without
further inquiry on such Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and
satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on
the holders of the applicable Notes.

The foregoing will apply _mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer is_
incorporated or organized, engaged in business or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through
which payment is made by or on behalf of such Person on the Notes and any political subdivision thereof or
therein.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee will be made free and clear of and
without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future tax, duty, levy, assessment or other
governmental charge, including any related interest, penalties or additions to tax (“Taxes”) unless the withholding
or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the official interpretation or administration thereof. If
any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any
jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is then incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes or resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having power to tax or (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the Issuer
or any Guarantor (including, without limitation, the jurisdiction of any paying agent for the Notes) or any political
subdivision thereof or therein (each, a “Tax Jurisdiction”) will at any time be required to be made from any
payments made under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments
of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay
such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received
in respect of such payments by each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes after such withholding or deduction
(including any such withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts
that would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction;
_provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:_

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence of any actual or
deemed present or former connection between the holder (or between a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary,
member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over the relevant holder, if the relevant holder is an
estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) or the beneficial owner of
the Notes and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being or having been a citizen,
resident, or national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business therein or
having or having had a permanent establishment therein), other than connections arising from the holding


-----

of such Note or any Note Guarantee, the enforcement of rights under such Note or under a Note
Guarantee or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note or a Note Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment
(where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than
30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent
that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last
day of such 30 day period);

(3) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes or any excise Taxes
imposed on transfers;

(4) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to, the
Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

(5) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or
beneficial owner of Notes to comply with any reasonable written request of the Issuer addressed to the
holder or beneficial owner and made at least 60 days before any such withholding or deduction would be
payable to satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether
required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction, as a
precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed
by such Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner
is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner
is legally eligible to provide such certification or documentation;

(6) all United States federal backup withholding taxes;

(7) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor
version of such sections), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any official interpretations thereof,
any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S.
jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing or any agreements entered into pursuant
to section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(8) any combination of items (1) through (7) above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable where, had the beneficial owner of the applicable Note been
the holder of such Note, it would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of
clauses (1) to (8) inclusive above.

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, will also pay and indemnify the
holder or beneficial owner for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any
other excise or property Taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable
expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance, or
registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred
to therein (other than a transfer of the Notes), or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, or the
enforcement of, any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee (limited, solely in the case of taxes attributable to the
receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded
under clauses (1) through (3) or (5) through (7) above).

If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional
Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to any Notes or any related Note Guarantee, each of
the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee on a date that is at least 10 days
prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 10 days prior
to that payment date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter)
an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be
so payable. The Officer’s Certificate must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the
Paying Agents to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. Such Trustee shall be
entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.


-----

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law and will remit the
full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or
the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing
the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee
(or to a holder or beneficial owner upon written request), within a reasonable time after the date the payment of
any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or
a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not
obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. Upon reasonable
request, copies of Tax receipts or other evidence of payments, as the case may be, will be made available by the
Trustee to the holders or beneficial owners of the applicable Notes.

Whenever in the Indenture or in this “Description of Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of
amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable
under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include
mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were
or would be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, and any transfer by
a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, _mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any_
successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes
or resident for tax purposes (and any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having
power to tax) and any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of such Person on the
Notes or any Note Guarantee and any political subdivision thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading
“Change of Control”, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to
$200,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Dollar Notes, and €100,000
principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Euro Notes) of such Holder’s
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the applicable Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);
_provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase the Notes as described under this heading,_
“Change of Control”, in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the
Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or
waived. No such purchase in part shall reduce the principal amount at maturity of the Dollar Notes held by any
holder to below $200,000 or the Euro Notes held by any holder to below €100,000.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional
_Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is_
60 days after any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Issuer’s option, at any time prior to a Change of
Control Triggering Event following the public announcement thereof or if a definitive agreement is in place for
the Change of Control, the Issuer will send a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such
Notes by mail or otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has
the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in
cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on
a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days from the date such notice is mailed
nor later than the later of 60 days from the date such notice is mailed and 60 days after the Change of
Control Triggering Event) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) and the record date;

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue
interest after the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and
that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;


-----

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control Triggering Event;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must
follow in order to have its Notes repurchased;

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that the
Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event;
and

(7) certain other procedures that a holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to
withdraw such acceptance.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and admitted for trading on the Exchange and the rules and
regulations of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a public announcement with respect to the results
of any Change of Control Offer as required by such rules. The ability of the Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant
to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Notes and the Structure—We may not be able to obtain enough funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase_
_the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event (as defined in_
_the Indenture) as required by the Indenture”._

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred, the Issuer
will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the relevant Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of
all Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the U.S. Paying Agent (in the case of the
Dollar Global Notes) or to the Euro Paying Agent (in the case of the Euro Global Notes) the applicable
Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been
tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for
cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agents, at the Issuer’s expense, will promptly
mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes,
and the Trustee will promptly instruct its authenticating agent to authenticate and, at the Issuer’s expense, mail
(or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive
Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided
that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof in the case of the Dollar Notes, and €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof, in the case of the Euro Notes.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will
publish a notice with respect to the results of the Change of Control Offer as required by such rules.

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the
Indenture are applicable. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes
upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party from seeking to acquire
Altice International or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if
a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the


-----

requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases
all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control
Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place
for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.

The provisions of the Indenture will not afford holders of the Notes the right to require the Issuer to repurchase
the Notes in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, certain transactions with Altice International’s
management or its Affiliates or certain other sale transactions, including a takeover, reorganization,
recapitalization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction (including, in certain circumstances, an acquisition
of Altice International by management or its Affiliates) involving the Issuer that may adversely affect holders of
the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control Triggering Event.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a
number of factors. The existing indebtedness of the Issuer, Altice International or the Restricted Subsidiaries
contains, and its respective future indebtedness may also contain, prohibitions of certain events that would
constitute a “change of control” thereunder or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon such a
change of control (and such change of control may not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the
Indenture). Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could
cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering
Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to
pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by Altice International’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’
then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary
to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—We may
_not be able to obtain enough funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of_
_certain events constituting a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) as required by the_
_Indenture”._

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of Altice International and its Restricted
Subsidiaries taken as a whole to a Person (including any “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the
Exchange Act)), other than a Permitted Holder. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the
phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.
As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require
the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating
to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering
Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount
of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

Altice International will not and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer may Incur Senior Secured Indebtedness if
on the date on which such Senior Secured Indebtedness is Incurred, the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage
Ratio would have been no greater than 3.0 to 1.0 determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma
application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if such Senior Secured Indebtedness had been incurred at the
beginning of the relevant Six Month Period.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following items of Indebtedness:


-----

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’
acceptances issued or created thereunder), in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding not to exceed the greater of €2,350 million and 100% of L2QA Pro Forma EBITDA;
_provided, that any Indebtedness Incurred under this clause (1) may be refinanced with additional_
Indebtedness in an amount equal to the principal of the Indebtedness so refinanced, plus, any additional
amount to pay premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance
costs and fees in connection therewith;

(2) (a) Guarantees by Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of Altice
International or any Restricted Subsidiary to the extent such guaranteed Indebtedness was permitted to
be Incurred by another provision of this covenant; provided that (i) if such Indebtedness is subordinated
in right of payment to, or _pari passu in right of payment with, the Notes or a Note Guarantee, as_
applicable, then the Guarantee of such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to, or pari
_passu in right of payment with, the Notes or such Note Guarantee, as applicable, substantially to the same_
extent as such guaranteed Indebtedness and (ii) if such guarantee is of Indebtedness of the Issuer, a
Guarantor, HOT or a HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor, such Restricted Subsidiary complies with the first
and second paragraph (as applicable) of the covenant described under “—Additional Guarantors”; or
(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens”, Indebtedness arising by
reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary securing
Indebtedness of Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of Altice International owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary, or Indebtedness of
a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by Altice International or any other Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided, however, that if the Issuer or any Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the payee_
is not the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness must be unsecured and ((i) except in respect of the
intercompany current liabilities incurred in connection with cash management positions of Altice
International and the Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) only to the extent legally permitted (Altice
International and the Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures required in the reasonable
judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to protect such Persons from any penalty or
civil or criminal liability in connection with the subordination of such Indebtedness)) expressly
subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations then due with respect to the Notes, in
the case of the Issuer, or the Note Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor; provided that:

(i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any
such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than Altice International or a
Restricted Subsidiary; and

(ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than Altice International
or a Restricted Subsidiary,

shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this
clause (3) by Altice International or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) issued on the Issue Date and
the Note Guarantees thereof, and Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facility and the Existing Senior
Secured Notes incurred on or prior to the Issue Date and, in each case, the Guarantees thereof, (b) any

the Issue Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, including the issuance of the Notes, and the

clause (5) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, (d) Management
Advances and (e) Indebtedness represented by the Security Documents and the HOT Security Documents
and including, with respect to each such Indebtedness, “parallel debt” obligations created under the

(5) Indebtedness (A) of any Person Incurred or outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with Altice
International or a Restricted Subsidiary or pursuant to any acquisition of assets and/or assumption of


-----

related liabilities (including in contemplation of such transaction) by Altice International or a Restricted
Subsidiary or (B) of the Issuer or any Guarantor Incurred to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized
to consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which a Person became a
Restricted Subsidiary or pursuant to any acquisition of assets and/or assumption of related liabilities by
Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by Altice International or a
Restricted Subsidiary or otherwise in connection with or contemplation of such acquisition or other
transaction; provided, however, that the Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this paragraph (5) is in an
aggregate amount not to exceed (a) the greater of €400 million and 25.0% of L2QA Pro Forma EBITDA
at any time outstanding plus (b) an unlimited amount of additional Indebtedness to the extent that
immediately following the consummation of such acquisition or other transaction and without giving
effect to any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (5)(a) on the date of determination, (x)(i) if such
Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant after giving effect to the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5)(b) or (ii) the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio
would not be greater than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction;
and (y)(i) if such Indebtedness is not Senior Secured Indebtedness (including Indebtedness of HoldCo
that is Guaranteed by the Issuer or a Guarantor), the Issuer or a Guarantor would have been able to
Guarantee €1.00 of additional Indebtedness of HoldCo pursuant to clause (15) of this paragraph after
giving effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5)(b) or (ii) the Consolidated
Net Leverage Ratio would not be greater than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition
or other transaction (it being understood that any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (5)(a) of this
paragraph shall cease to be deemed Incurred or outstanding for purposes of clause (5)(a) of this paragraph
but shall be deemed Incurred under clause (5)(b)(x) or 5(b)(y) of this paragraph from and after the first
date on which the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary could have incurred such Indebtedness under
clause (5)(b)(x) or 5(b)(y) of this paragraph without reliance on clause (5)(a) of this paragraph);

(6) Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount that, when aggregated with the principal amount of all
other Indebtedness then outstanding and Incurred (including any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof) pursuant to this clause (6) will not exceed an amount equal to 100% of the Available RP Capacity
Amount; provided that to the extent the Available RP Capacity Amount is used to Incur Indebtedness
pursuant to this clause (6), the Incurrence of such Indebtedness shall reduce the amounts which Altice
International or any Restricted Subsidiary may pay to a Permitted Holder or any other person holding a
direct or indirect interest in Altice International in an amount equal to the Available RP Capacity Amount
so utilized (with the applicable provisions or baskets that are so reduced to be determined by Altice
International in good faith until such time as such Indebtedness is reclassified, repaid, redesignated,
repurchased, redeemed or otherwise retired); it being understood that the capacity to make any Restricted
Payments under the first paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on Restricted Payments”
or any Permitted Payments provision under the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“Limitation on Restricted Payments” may not be reduced below zero under this proviso;

through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, in an
aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (8) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any time
outstanding the greater of €400 million and 2.8% of Total Assets; _provided that any Indebtedness_
incurred under this clause (8) may be refinanced with additional Indebtedness in an amount equal to the


-----

principal of the Indebtedness so refinanced, _plus, any additional amount to pay premiums (including_
tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection
therewith.

(9) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, performance,
indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax or other guarantees

in the ordinary course of business or in respect of any governmental requirement, including in relation
to a governmental requirement to provide a guarantee or bond; (b) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances,

Person acquiring or disposing of such business or assets or such Subsidiary for the purpose of financing
such acquisition or disposition);

(11) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar

Indebtedness (including by way of set-off or exchange); provided that such Indebtedness does not exceed
the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced and the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing, so long
as any such Indebtedness is repaid within three days of the date on which such Indebtedness is Incurred;

(13) [Reserved];

(14) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or a Guarantor or Disqualified Stock of Altice International in an
aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (14) and then outstanding, will not exceed 100% of the Net
Cash Proceeds received by Altice International and the Restricted Subsidiaries from the issuance or sale
(other than to Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Subordinated Shareholder Funding
or Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares or an Excluded
Contribution) or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified
Stock, Designated Preference Shares or an Excluded Contribution) of Altice International, in each case,

or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the first paragraph
and clauses (1) and (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” to the extent Altice International or a Restricted_
Subsidiary Incurs Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received
or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (14) to
the extent Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment under the first
paragraph and clauses (1) and (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” in reliance thereon;_ _provided, that any_
Indebtedness Incurred under this clause (14) may be refinanced with additional Indebtedness in an
amount equal to the principal of the Indebtedness so refinanced, plus, any additional amount to pay
premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees
in connection therewith;

(15) (A) the Guarantee by the Issuer or any Guarantor of Indebtedness of HoldCo if, on the date of the
Incurrence of such Guarantee, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio would have been no greater than 4.0
to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds from the


-----

Incurrence of such Indebtedness), as if such Guarantee had been Incurred at the beginning of the relevant
Six Month Period, provided such Guarantees shall be subordinated to the Notes and the Note Guarantee
of such Guarantor pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to
substantially the same extent, and on substantially the same terms as is customary for debt structures of
this type on the Issue Date; and (B) the Incurrence of Indebtedness by the Issuer under a HoldCo Proceeds
Loan representing all or substantially all of the net proceeds of a substantially concurrent Incurrence of
Indebtedness by HoldCo that is guaranteed by the Issuer and the Guarantors pursuant to sub-clause (A)
of this clause (15) or clauses (5), (14) and (16) of this paragraph, provided that (i) any HoldCo Proceeds
Loan is subordinated to the Notes to the same extent as the Guarantees referred to in clause (A) of this
clause (15), and (ii) any HoldCo Proceeds Loan is granted as Notes Collateral and any payments under
such HoldCo Proceeds Loan are subject to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(16) Indebtedness Incurred in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the
principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (16) and then outstanding,
will not exceed the greater of €1,200 million and 50% of L2QA Pro Forma EBITDA; provided that any
Indebtedness incurred under this clause (16) may be refinanced with additional Indebtedness in an
amount equal to the principal of the Indebtedness so refinanced, _plus, any additional amount to pay_
premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees
in connection therewith; and

(17) Indebtedness of Altice International or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries arising pursuant to any Permitted
Reorganization.

In the event the Issuer Incurs any Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or clauses (8), (14),
(15) (upon receipt from HoldCo of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Incurrence of such Indebtedness by HoldCo)
or (16) of the second paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will substantially concurrently with the Incurrence of
such Indebtedness (or in the case of any Indebtedness the proceeds of which are deposited into an escrow account
or similar arrangement pending the occurrence of one or more events, concurrently with the release of such
proceeds from such escrow account or similar arrangement (other than in the case that such proceeds are returned
to the holders of, or lenders under, such Indebtedness pursuant to the terms of such escrow account or similar
arrangement)), make one or more Issuer Proceeds Loans to one or more Guarantors or (prior to the HOT Direct
Obligation Event) to HOT and any of its Subsidiaries that are HOT Proceeds Note Guarantors (so long as HOT
or such Subsidiary grants a Lien over its material assets and, in the case of such Subsidiary provides a HOT
Proceeds Note Guarantee, in the amount of such additional Issuer Proceeds Loan) with all or substantially all of
the net proceeds of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Issuer.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described
in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and
may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount
and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this
covenant;

(2) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(3) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (8), (14) or (16) of
the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances
or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be
included;

(4) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the
maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or
repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;


-----

(5) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and

(6) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal
to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the
form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be
(a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the
principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”,
the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness,
the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, or at the option
of the Issuer, the date first committed; _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other_
Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable eurodenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness
being refinanced, plus any additional amount to pay premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid
interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection therewith; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal
amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a currency other
than euro is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is
denominated covering principal amount and interest payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such
Indebtedness, will be the Euro Equivalent of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency
Agreement plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by
such Currency Agreement.

For purposes of determining compliance with the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount
of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, or at the option of the Issuer, the date first committed;
_provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other_
than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if
calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated
restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus any amount to pay
premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in
connection therewith; and (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding
on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date.

In addition, for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated
Net Leverage Ratio to test compliance with any covenant in the Indenture, in determining the amount of
Indebtedness outstanding in euro on any date of determination, with respect to any Indebtedness denominated in
a currency other than euro (the “Foreign Currency”):

(1) subject to a currency swap arrangement or contract, the aggregate principal amount of such Foreign
Currency Indebtedness on any such date of determination shall be the euro amount of the aggregate
principal amount to be paid by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary on the maturity date of such currency
swap arrangement or contract pursuant to the terms thereof; or


-----

(2) subject to a currency forward arrangement, forward accretion curve or contract, the aggregate principal
amount of such Foreign Currency Indebtedness shall be converted into euro at the exchange rate specified
under the terms of such currency forward arrangement, forward accretion curve or contract as applicable
to such Foreign Currency Indebtedness on such date of determination.

For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding a Group member entering into any such arrangement or contract
hedging foreign exchange exposure of any Foreign Currency Indebtedness, for the purposes of calculating the
Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the aggregate principal
amount of Indebtedness subject to any such arrangement or contract shall be attributed to the total Indebtedness
of the Person that originally Incurred such Indebtedness.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that Altice
International or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.

Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness (including any Indebtedness permitted to be
Incurred pursuant to the second paragraph of this covenant) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment
to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Note Guarantee on substantially identical terms
(as determined in good faith by the Issuer); _provided,_ _however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be_
contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by
virtue of being unsecured, by virtue of being secured with different collateral, by virtue of not being guaranteed
by one or more of Altice International’s Subsidiaries, by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by
virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment-ordering provisions affecting different tranches of
Indebtedness under Credit Facilities.

connection therewith;

Cash Proceeds received by Altice International from the issuance or sale of such Designated Preference
Shares;

(17) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or would result therefrom), any Restricted
Payment to the extent that, after giving pro forma effect to any such Restricted Payment, the Consolidated

Affiliate of Altice International shall, promptly following the closing thereof, cause (1) all property

-----

acquisition, (iii) such Parent or Affiliate of Altice International receives no consideration or other
payment in connection with such transaction except to the extent Altice International or a Restricted
Subsidiary could have given such consideration or made such payment in compliance with this covenant
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or the covenant “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions” and (iv)

or not successful) of such Parent; and

(22) Restricted Payments made in connection with, or constituting any part of, any Permitted Reorganization

Altice International, on the date of entry into of a commitment, contract or resolution with respect to such
Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment) of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued
by Altice International or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment or
Permitted Investment and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value. The fair market value of any cash
Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash
Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment or any other property, assets or securities required to be valued by
this covenant shall be determined conclusively by an Officer or the Board of Directors of Altice International
acting in good faith.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant and the definition of “Permitted Investments”, as
applicable, in the event that a Restricted Payment or a Permitted Investment meets the criteria of more than one
of the categories described in clauses (1) through (22) above, or, in the definition of “Permitted Investments”, as
applicable, or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, Altice International will be entitled to
classify such Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) or such Permitted Investment (or portion thereof) on the date
of its payment or later reclassify such Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) or such Permitted Investment (or
portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

Altice International will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of their property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or
profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case
of any property or asset that does not constitute Notes Collateral or HOT Proceeds Note Collateral, (i) Permitted
Liens or (ii) Liens on assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture (or a Note Guarantee in
the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens
with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such
Indebtedness is so secured, (b) in the case of any property or assets that constitutes Notes Collateral, Permitted
Collateral Liens; and (c) in the case of any property or assets that constitutes HOT Proceeds Note Collateral,
Permitted HOT Proceeds Note Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the preceding paragraph will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to
which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Notes Security—Release of Notes Collateral”.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (x) a Lien need not be Incurred solely by reference
to one category of Permitted Liens, Permitted HOT Proceeds Note Collateral Liens or Permitted Collateral Liens,
as applicable, but may be Incurred under any combination of such categories (including in part under one such
category and in part under any other such category) and (y) in the event that a Lien (or any portion thereof) meets
the criteria of one or more of such categories of Permitted Liens, Permitted HOT Proceeds Note Collateral Liens


-----

or Permitted Collateral Liens, as applicable, Altice International shall, in its sole discretion, divide, classify or
may subsequently reclassify at any time such Lien (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this
covenant and the definition of “Permitted Liens”, “Permitted HOT Proceeds Note Collateral Liens” or “Permitted
Collateral Liens”, as applicable.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

Altice International will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, create or otherwise cause or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of Altice
International or any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock to Altice
International or any Restricted Subsidiary or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to Altice
International or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to Altice International or any Restricted
Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary, or any requirement
that such loans or advances made to Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary cannot be secured, shall not
be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to any Credit Facility or any other agreement or instrument, in
each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date, and any amendments, restatements, modifications,
renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of such agreements; provided that the
amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or
refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other
payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the Issue Date (as determined in good
faith by the Issuer);

(2) [Reserved];

(3) encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees,
the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees thereof, the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes and the Guarantees thereof, the indentures governing the Existing
Senior Notes, the Senior Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Facilities, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents, the security documents governing the
Existing Senior Notes, the HOT Proceeds Note, the HOT Security Documents, the HOT Credit Facility
and the Issuer Proceeds Loans (other than the HOT Proceeds Note);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which (i) such Person
was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into Altice International or any
Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) such agreement or instrument is assumed by Altice International or any
Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets or (iii) such Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary (in each case, other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to
provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by Altice
International or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into Altice International or any
Restricted Subsidiary) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (4), if
another Person is the Successor Company (as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”) or any
Subsidiary thereof, any agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed
acquired or assumed by Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the
Successor Company;


-----

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refunding,
replacement or refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise extends, renews,
refunds, refinances or replaces, an agreement or instrument referred to in clause (1), (3) or (4) of this
paragraph or this clause (5) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other
modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1), (3) or (4) of this paragraph or this clause (5);
_provided,_ _however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary_
contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders
taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial
Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(6) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any
lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the Indenture or
securing Indebtedness of Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or
assets subject to such mortgages, pledges or other security agreements;

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) pursuant to the terms of any license, authorization, concession or permit;

(7) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the
property so acquired or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes
restrictions on the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;

(8) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of
all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets
that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(9) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation, governmental license or order, or required by any regulatory authority or stock exchange;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements or
Commodity Hedging Agreements;

(13) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained
in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of
the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facilities or
Senior Credit Facility on the Issue Date, together with the security documents associated therewith, if
any, and the Intercreditor Agreement, as in effect on or immediately prior to the Issue Date or (ii) is
customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) and where, in the case
of clause (ii), the Issuer determines at the time of issuance of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances
or restrictions (x) will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal
or interest payments on the Notes as and when they become due or (y) such encumbrances and


-----

restrictions apply only if a default occurs in respect of a payment or financial covenant relating to such
Indebtedness;

(14) any encumbrance or restrictions arising in connection with any Purchase Money Note, other Indebtedness
or a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith determination of an Officer or the Board of
Directors of Altice International, are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified Receivables
Financing; or

(15) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens”.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

Altice International will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) Altice International or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of
contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by an Officer or the Board
of Directors of Altice International, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap); and

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition or
such series of related Asset Dispositions (excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any
other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than
Indebtedness), together with all other Asset Dispositions since the Issue Date (except to the extent any
such Asset Disposition was a Permitted Asset Swap) on a cumulative basis, received by Altice
International or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents
or Temporary Cash Investments.

After the receipt of Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition, Altice International or a Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, may apply such Net Available Cash directly or indirectly (at the option of
Altice International or such Restricted Subsidiary):

(a) (1) within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt
of such Net Available Cash (i) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness incurred
under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”;_ _provided,_ _however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or_
purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a)(i), Altice International or such Restricted
Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) (except
in the case of any revolving Indebtedness) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the
principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchased or redeemed; (ii) unless included in clause (a)(i),
to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor
that is secured in whole or in part by a Lien on the Notes Collateral (including by virtue of the
Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement), which Lien ranks _pari_
_passu with the Liens securing the Notes, at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount_
of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment,
repayment, purchase or redemption; provided that the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable,
shall prepay, redeem, repay or repurchase Pari Passu Indebtedness that is Public Debt pursuant
to this clause (ii) only if the Issuer or such Guarantor purchases through open market purchases
at a price equal to or higher than 100% of the principal amount thereof, or makes an offer to the
holders of the Notes to purchase their Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100%
of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the
date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date) for, in each case, an aggregate principal
amount of Notes at least equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of
Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum of the total aggregate principal amount of Notes
outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness; (iii) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted


-----

Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured on assets which do not
constitute Notes Collateral (in each case, other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or
a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary); (iv) to
purchase the Notes through open market purchases at a price equal to or higher than 100% of
the principal amount thereof, or make an offer to all holders of Notes at a purchase price in cash
equal to at least 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to,
but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) or (v) to redeem the
Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(b) to the extent Altice International or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or purchase
or commit to invest in or purchase Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in
Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by Altice
International or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of
such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that
any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or
a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of Altice International that is executed or
approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment or
commitment to invest is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day;

(c) to make a capital expenditure within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset
Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such
capital expenditure made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved
by the Board of Directors of Altice International that is executed or approved within such time
will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of
such 365th day; or

(d) any combination of the foregoing,

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a),_
(b), (c) or (d) above, Altice International and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce
Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or
invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”. On the 366th day
(or the 546th day, in the case of any Net Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to a definitive binding
agreement or commitment approved by the Board of Directors of Altice International pursuant to clauses (b) or
(c) of the second paragraph of this covenant) after the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the
receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €100 million, the Issuer
will be required within ten (10) Business Days thereof to make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all
holders of Notes and, to the extent the Issuer or a Guarantor elects or the Issuer or a Guarantor is required by the
terms of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders of such other outstanding Pari Passu
Indebtedness to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which
the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect
of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than)
100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each
case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and
(i) in the case of the Dollar Notes, in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof and (ii) in the case of the Euro Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. No such purchase in part shall reduce the principal amount at maturity of
the Notes held by any holder to below $200,000 in the case of the Dollar Notes and to below €100,000 in the case
of the Euro Notes. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from
an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to such Net Available Cash prior to the
time period that may be required by the Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Net Available Cash
(the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”).

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance
Offer, the Advance Portion), Altice International and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use any remaining Excess


-----

Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for general corporate purposes, to the extent
not prohibited by the other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders
or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance
Portion), the Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) shall be allocated among
the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal
amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of
any such Indebtedness not denominated in euros, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such
principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset
Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero, and in the case of an Advance Offer, the amount of Net Available Cash the
Issuer is offering to apply in such Advance Offer shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency
other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of
such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is
actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20
Business Days following its commencement or such shorter period of time required to comply with Section 14(e)
of the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations in connection with the Asset
Disposition Offer (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five (5) Business Days after the termination
of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the
principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it
pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer
Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the
Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a
_pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness_
or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and,
(i) in the case of the Dollar Notes, in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof and (ii) in the case of Euro Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes
or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The
Issuer or the Paying Agents, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five (5) Business
Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Notes
an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder,
and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable
Global Note), and the Trustee, upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will, via an authenticating
agent, authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) such new Note to such Holder,
in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new
Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of $200,000 in the case of the Dollar Notes,
and €100,000, in the case of the Euro Notes of a series. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or
delivered (or transferred by book-entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee (or other extinguishment in connection with the transactions relating to
such Asset Dispositions) of Indebtedness and any other liabilities (as recorded on the balance sheet of
Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary or in the footnotes thereto, or if incurred or accrued
subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on Altice
International’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or in the footnotes thereof if such incurrence
or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith Altice
International) of Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness
of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of Altice International or such Restricted Subsidiary from
all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;


-----

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary from
the transferee that are converted by Altice International or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition to the extent of the cash
received;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that Altice International and each other Restricted Subsidiary (as
applicable) are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such
Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not Altice International or any
Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary
in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding,
not to exceed the greater of €400 million and 25% of L2QA Pro Forma EBITDA (with the fair market
value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received or, at the
option of Altice International, at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition, and without
giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

Altice International will not and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter
into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of
any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of Altice International (any such transaction or
series of related transactions being “Affiliate Transactions”) involving aggregate value in excess of €50 million
unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to Altice
International or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for
such transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate or, if there are no
comparable transactions involving non-Affiliates to apply for comparative purposes, the transaction is
otherwise on terms that, taken as a whole, Altice International has conclusively determined in good faith
to be fair to Altice International or such Restricted Subsidiary; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of €100 million, the terms
of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the majority
of the members of the Board of Directors of Altice International resolving that such transaction complies
with clause (1) above; _provided that an Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the_
requirements set forth in this clause (2) of this paragraph if either (x) such Affiliate Transaction is
approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors or (y) Altice International or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor
stating that such transaction is fair to Altice International or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial
point of view or stating that the terms are not materially less favorable to Altice International or its
relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by
Altice International or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on arm’s length basis.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation

case, other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Exchange for so
long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such
listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Exchange, and thereafter use its best efforts to
maintain, a listing of such Notes on another recognized stock exchange.

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, Altice International will provide to the Trustee the following reports:

applicable, unaudited pro forma income statement information and balance sheet information of Altice
International (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement

-----

acquisition or disposition by Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary that, individually or in the
aggregate when considered with all other acquisitions or dispositions that have occurred during the most
recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates, represent greater than 20% of the
consolidated revenues, Consolidated EBITDA, or assets of Altice International on a _pro forma_
consolidated basis or (ii) recapitalizations by Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case,
that have occurred during the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates
(unless such _pro forma information has been provided in a prior report pursuant to clause (2) or_
(3) below); _provided that such_ _pro_ _forma financial information will be provided only to the extent_
available without unreasonable expense and in the case pro _forma financial information is not provided,_
Altice International will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, financial statements of the acquired
company for the most recent fiscal year, and in the case of a material disposition, financial statements of
the business or assets comprising the disposition perimeter for the most recent fiscal year which, in each
case, may be unaudited; (c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements,
including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources
of Altice International, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical

reported pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below).

information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter yearto-date period ending on the date of the unaudited condensed balance sheet, and the comparable prior

information and balance sheet information (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the
provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together
with explanatory footnotes, for any acquisition or disposition by Altice International or a Restricted
Subsidiary that, individually or in the aggregate when considered with all other acquisitions or
dispositions that have occurred during the relevant quarter, represent greater than 20% of the consolidated
revenues, Consolidated EBITDA, or assets of Altice International on a _pro forma consolidated basis_
(unless such pro forma information has been provided in a prior report pursuant to clause (3) below);
_provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without_
unreasonable expense and in the case pro forma financial information is not provided, Altice
International will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, financial statements of the acquired
company for the most recent fiscal year, and in the case of a material disposition, financial statements of
the business or assets comprising the disposition perimeter for the most recent fiscal year which, in each
case, may be unaudited; (c) a summary operating and financial review of the unaudited financial

independent public accountants of Altice International, (b) any material acquisition, disposal, merger or
similar transaction or (c) any development determined by an Officer of Altice International to be material
to the business of Altice International and its Restricted Subsidiaries (taken as a whole).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Altice International may satisfy its obligations under clauses (1) and (2) of the
first paragraph by delivering the corresponding annual and quarterly reports of a Parent; provided that to the extent
that Altice International is not the reporting entity and material differences exist between the management,
business, assets, shareholding or results of operations or financial condition of Altice International or such Parent
as applicable, the annual and quarterly reports shall give a reasonably detailed description of such differences and
include either (x) an unaudited reconciliation of Altice International’s consolidated financial statements to such
Parent’s consolidated financial statements, as applicable or (y) the consolidated balance sheet, income statement
and cash flow statement of Altice International and its Subsidiaries.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such
report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the
periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may in the event


-----

of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. Except as provided for below,
no report need include separate financial statements for Altice International or Subsidiaries of Altice International
or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a
type included in this Offering Memorandum and in no event shall U.S. GAAP information or reconciliation to
U.S. GAAP be required.

At any time if any Subsidiary of Altice International is an Unrestricted Subsidiary and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this covenant
will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes
thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of Altice International and its Restricted Subsidiaries
separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of Altice
International.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in (1), (2) and (3) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, Altice International shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post
copies of such reports on such website as may be then maintained by the Issuer, Altice International and its
Subsidiaries or any Parent or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable public availability of such reports
(as determined by Altice International in good faith) or (b) to the extent Altice International determines in good
faith that such reports cannot be made available in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to
applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports to the Holders and,
upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Notes. Altice International will also make available copies of all
reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and so long as the Notes are
listed on the Exchange and the rules and regulations of the Exchange so require, at the Issuer’s registered office
or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and regulations.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Issuer is not subject
to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Issuer shall
furnish to the Holders and holders of beneficial interests in the Notes and, upon their request, prospective
purchasers of the Notes or prospective and purchasers of beneficial interests in the Notes, the information required
to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Delivery of the above reports to the Trustee is for information purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such
reports will not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from
information contained therein, including Altice International’s or any other parties’ compliance with any of its
covenants in the Indenture (as to which the Trustee will be entitled to rely exclusively on Officer’s Certificates
that are delivered).

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not the
Issuer is the surviving corporation), or (2) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer taken as a whole in one or more related transactions, to
another Person.

_Altice International_

Altice International will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series
of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) (if not Altice International) will
be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union as of the
Issue Date or the date on which such Person becomes the Successor Company, United Kingdom,
Switzerland, Canada, the State of Israel or the United States of America, any State of the United States
or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not Altice International) will expressly
assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of Altice International under the Notes and the Indenture


-----

and (b) all obligations of Altice International under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents (or subject to the covenant under “—Impairment of Security Interests” provide a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets), as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction and any related financing transactions, as
if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Six Month Period, either (a) the Issuer
and the Guarantors would have been able to Guarantee €1.00 of additional Indebtedness of HoldCo
pursuant to clause (15) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”; or (b) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio would not be greater than it was immediately_
prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to
the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply
with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has
been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable
against the Successor Company (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as
to any matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of Altice International, which properties
and assets, if held by Altice International instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of
the properties and assets of Altice International on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all
or substantially all of the properties and assets of Altice International.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, Altice
International under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor
company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence)
and clause (4) of the second paragraph of this covenant (which does not apply to transactions referred to in this
sentence in which Altice International is the Successor Company), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate
or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to Altice International (so
long as Altice International is a Guarantor); (b) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may consolidate
or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted
Subsidiary or Altice International; and (c) Altice International and the Restricted Subsidiaries may effect any
Permitted Reorganization. Notwithstanding the preceding clause (3) (which does not apply to the transactions
referred to in this sentence) of the second paragraph of this covenant, Altice International may consolidate or
otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal
domicile of Altice International, reincorporating Altice International in another jurisdiction or changing the legal
form of Altice International.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the second paragraph of this “Merger and
_Consolidation” covenant) shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary._

_The Subsidiary Guarantors_

None of the Subsidiary Guarantors (other than a Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be released in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person);


-----

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety
or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it;

unless:

(A) the other Person is Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes
a Guarantor as a result of such transaction; or

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the surviving Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its
Note Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and
delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and all obligations of the
Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement and Security Documents, as applicable;
and

(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and is continuing;

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or

Guarantor (in each case other than to Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise
permitted by the Indenture and the proceeds therefrom are applied as required by the Indenture;
or

(D) the transaction constitutes a Permitted Reorganization.

Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence),
(a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties and assets to a Guarantor and (b) any Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge
into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Guarantor. Notwithstanding the preceding
clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a Guarantor may consolidate
or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the
legal domicile of the Guarantor reincorporating the Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form
of the Guarantor.

_The HOT Proceeds Note Obligors_

Prior to the HOT Direct Obligation Event, none of the HOT Proceeds Note Obligors (other than a HOT Proceeds

Indenture and the HOT Proceeds Note) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such HOT Proceeds Note Obligor is
the surviving Person);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety
or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(A) the other Person is HOT, Altice International, a Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor as a result of such transaction or a Restricted Subsidiary that is a HOT Proceeds Note
Guarantor or becomes a HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor as a result of such transaction; or

(B) (1) either (x) a HOT Proceeds Note Obligor is the surviving Person or (y) the resulting, surviving
or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the HOT Proceeds Note Obligor


-----

under its HOT Proceeds Note Guarantee and the HOT Proceeds Note and all obligations of the
HOT Proceeds Note Obligor under the HOT Security Documents, as applicable; and

(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and is continuing and default or event of default under the HOT Proceeds Note or the
Indenture shall have occurred and is continuing;

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a
HOT Proceeds Note Obligor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a HOT
Proceeds Note Obligor (in each case other than to Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary)
otherwise permitted by the Indenture and the proceeds therefrom are applied as required by the Indenture;
or

(D) the transaction constitutes a Permitted Reorganization.

Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence),
(a) any Subsidiary of HOT that is a Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into
or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a HOT Proceeds Note Obligor, (b) any HOT Proceeds Note
Obligor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets
to any other HOT Proceeds Note Obligor, and (c) HOT may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into

preceding clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a HOT Proceeds
Note Obligor may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for
the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the HOT Proceeds Note Obligor, reincorporating the HOT Proceeds
Note Obligor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the HOT Proceeds Note Obligor.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

Public Debt or any Indebtedness under syndicated Credit Facilities of the Issuer or any Guarantor (other than

Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form
attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Note Guarantee, which

_provided, this covenant will not be applicable to any Guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the_

Indebtedness. HOT will not Guarantee any Public Debt or syndicated Credit Facilities of any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (other than a HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor) (other than Indebtedness Incurred under clause (8) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on _Indebtedness”) unless such Guarantee is_
pari passu or junior to the obligations of HOT under the HOT Proceeds Note.

Note Guarantees and HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees existing on or granted after the Issue Date pursuant to this
covenant shall be released as set forth under “—Releases of the Note Guarantees” and “—Releases of the HOT
_Proceeds Note Guarantees”. Note Guarantees and HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees (as applicable) existing on or_
granted after the Issue Date pursuant to the first or second paragraphs of this covenant may be released at the
option of the Issuer or HOT, as the case may be, if, at the date of such release, (i) the Indebtedness which required
such Note Guarantee or HOT Proceeds Note Guarantee, as the case may be, has been released or discharged in
full, (ii) no Event of Default would arise as a result of such release, and (iii) there is no other Indebtedness of such
Guarantor or HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor, as the case may be, outstanding that was Incurred after the Issue
Date and that could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as of the date Incurred if such
Guarantor or HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor were not a Guarantor or a HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor, as the case
may be, as at that date. Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, the Issuer may elect, in its sole
discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor and
such Notes Guarantee may be released at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion. The Trustee and the Security
Agent (to the extent action is required by it) shall each take all necessary actions requested by the Issuer, including
the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee or HOT Proceeds Note Guarantee in accordance with these
provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

Each additional Note Guarantee and HOT Proceeds Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize
certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Altice International and HOT shall not be obligated to cause (x) an Excluded
Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee or a HOT Proceeds Note Guarantee (for so long as such entity is an
Excluded Subsidiary) or (y) a Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee or a HOT Proceeds Note
Guarantee to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee could reasonably be expected to give
rise to or result in: (1) any violation of applicable law or regulation; (2) any liability for the officers, directors or
(except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or,
in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such
partnership); (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any
governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to clause (1) of this paragraph
undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee, which in any case under any of clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this
paragraph cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to Altice International, HOT or such
Restricted Subsidiary; or (4) such Restricted Subsidiary is prohibited from Incurring such Guarantee by the terms
of any Indebtedness of such Restricted Subsidiary that is not prepayable without a prepayment premium (in each
case, other than Indebtedness Incurred to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate the
transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary);
provided that this clause (4) applies only for so long as such prepayment premium applies to such Indebtedness.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, any series of Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, the Issuer shall notify the Trustee
of these events and beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the applicable series of
Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized
under the following captions will not apply to such Notes: “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments”, “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”, “—_
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”, “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions” and “—Impairment_
_of Security Interests”, the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—_
_Merger and Consolidation—Altice International”, and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture_


-----

will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to Altice International and the Restricted Subsidiaries. Such
covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which
a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions
of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture except that no_
Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was
suspended. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will
be classified, at the Issuer’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such
covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date
and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion
Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be Incurred under the first two paragraphs of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”.

On and after each Reversion Date, Altice International and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to perform under, or
consummate the transactions contemplated by, any contract entered into during the period of time between the
Suspension Event and the Reversion Date (the “Suspension Period”), so long as such contract and such
consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

The Issuer shall give the Trustee written notice of any Covenant Suspension Event and in any event no later than
five (5) Business Days after such Covenant Suspension Event has occurred. The Issuer shall give the Trustee
written notice of any occurrence of a Reversion Date not later than five (5) Business Days after such Reversion
Date.

**_Impairment of Security Interests_**

Altice International shall not and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that
would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Notes Collateral (it being
understood that subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under
no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Notes Collateral) for the
benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and Altice International shall not and shall not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent (or its delegate), for the benefit of the Trustee
and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any Lien over any of the Notes Collateral; provided, that, subject to the
next succeeding paragraph, (x) Altice International and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral
Liens, (y) the Notes Collateral may be discharged, amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released,
modified or replaced in accordance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the applicable Security Documents and (z) Altice International and the Restricted Subsidiaries may
consummate any other transaction permitted under “—Merger and Consolidation”.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of any Lien over the
Notes Collateral in accordance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the applicable Security Documents. Subject to the foregoing, the Security Documents may be
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by an
immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) to (i) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) make any change
reasonably necessary or desirable in the good faith determination of the Issuer in order to implement transactions
permitted under “—Merger and Consolidation;” (iv) add to the Notes Collateral; (v) provide for the release of
any Lien on any properties or assets constituting Notes Collateral from the Lien of the Security Documents,
provided that such release is followed by the substantially concurrent re-taking of a Lien of at least equivalent
priority over the same properties and assets securing the Notes or any Note Guarantee; (vi) make any other change
thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect (it being understood that such restatement,
amendment or other modification to provide for subordinated security interests will be deemed not to adversely
affect the Holders) or (vii) subject to compliance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, increase the amounts and types of Indebtedness covered by such Security
Document; provided, however, that, contemporaneously with any such action in clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi),
the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee, from an independent financial advisor or appraiser or investment bank of international standing which


-----

confirms the solvency of Altice International and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement,
(2) a certificate from the chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms
the solvency of the Person granting the Security Interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of
Counsel (subject to any qualifications customary for this type of opinion of counsel), in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created
under the Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are
valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that
such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement.

Altice International shall not and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that
would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the HOT Proceeds Note
Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Permitted HOT Proceeds Note Collateral Liens, subject to
the next succeeding paragraph, shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest
with respect to the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral) for the benefit of the lenders under the HOT Proceeds Note
and Altice International shall not and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than
the Security Agent (or its delegate) any Lien over any of the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral; provided, that, subject
to the next succeeding paragraph, (w) Altice International and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted
HOT Proceeds Note Collateral Liens, (x) the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral may be discharged, amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced in accordance with the HOT Proceeds
Note or the applicable HOT Security Documents, (y) Altice International and their Restricted Subsidiaries may
consummate any other transaction permitted under “—Merger and Consolidation” and (z) Altice International
and its Restricted Subsidiaries may consummate the HOT Direct Obligation Event.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of any HOT Proceeds
Note Security Interest in accordance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the HOT Security Documents may be amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien
of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) to (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency
therein; (ii) provide for HOT Proceeds Note Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) make any change reasonably
necessary in the good faith determination of the Issuer in order to implement transactions permitted under “—
_Merger and Consolidation;” (iv) add to the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral; (v) provide for the release of any HOT_
Proceeds Note Security Interest on any properties or assets constituting HOT Proceeds Note Collateral from the
Lien of the HOT Security Documents; provided that such release is followed by the substantially concurrent retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent priority over the same properties and assets securing the HOT Proceeds
Note or any HOT Proceeds Note Guarantee; (vi) consummate a HOT Direct Obligation Event or (vii) make any
other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders or the Issuer in any material respect; provided,
_however, that, contemporaneously with any such action in clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), and (vii) the Issuer_
delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
from an independent financial advisor or appraiser or investment bank of international standing which confirms
the solvency of HOT and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the
chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the Person
granting HOT Proceeds Note Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel (subject
to any qualifications customary for this type of Opinion of Counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the HOT Security
Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens not
otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or
Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement.

In the event that Altice International and the Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such
amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.


-----

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, and without the consent of the Holders, in connection
with the Incurrence by Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary of any Indebtedness that is permitted to
share the Notes Collateral pursuant to the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens, Altice International or a
Restricted Subsidiary, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness
(or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”)
or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the
same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including
containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Note Guarantees and priority and release of the
Liens over the Notes Collateral (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders it being understood that such
restatement, amendment or other modification to provide for subordinated security interests will be deemed not
to be materially less favorable to the Holders); provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security
Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent
under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the foregoing and the
succeeding paragraph, any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement may provide for pari passu or subordinated
security interests in respect of any such Indebtedness (to the extent such Indebtedness is permitted to share the
Notes Collateral pursuant to the definition of Permitted Collateral Lien).

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency
of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may
be Incurred by the Issuer or a Guarantor that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new
Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor
Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes),
(5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Notes Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement
any Permitted Collateral Lien, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
in accordance with the terms thereof, (8) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement such that the maximum aggregate principal amount of Super Priority Indebtedness permitted to be
Incurred or designated thereunder shall not exceed the maximum amount of Indebtedness that can be Incurred
under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”,
(9) make any change reasonably necessary or desirable in the good faith determination of the Issuer in order to
implement any transaction that is subject to the covenants described under the caption “—Merger and
_Consolidation”, or (10) implement any transaction in connection with the renewal extension, refinancing,_
replacement or increase of Indebtedness that is not prohibited by the Indenture or make any other change to any
such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; provided that no such changes
pursuant to sub-clause (10) above shall be permitted to the extent they affect the ranking of any Note or Note
Guarantee, enforcement of Liens over the Notes Collateral, the application of proceeds from the enforcement of
Notes Collateral or the release of any Note Guarantees or Lien over the Notes Collateral in a manner than would
adversely affect the rights of the Holders in any material respect except as otherwise permitted by the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement immediately prior to such change. The
Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor
Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “Amendments and Waivers”, and the Issuer may only
direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security
Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, at the request of the Issuer, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of
the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption
of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement


-----

(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Limited Condition Acquisition and Irrevocable Repayment_**

In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable
Repayment, for purposes of determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture which requires that no
Default or Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result from any such action, as
applicable, such condition shall, at the option of Altice International, be deemed satisfied, so long as no Default
or Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date the definitive agreements or irrevocable notice for such
Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment are entered into or has been delivered, as applicable.
For the avoidance of doubt, if Altice International has exercised its option under the first sentence of this paragraph,
and any Default or Event of Default occurs following the date the definitive agreements or irrevocable notice for
the applicable Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment were entered into or has been delivered,
as applicable, and prior to the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment,
any such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to not have occurred or be continuing for purposes of
determining whether any action being taken in connection with such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable
Repayment is permitted hereunder.

In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable
Repayment for purposes of:

(1) determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture which requires the calculation of the
Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio; or

(2) testing baskets set forth in the Indenture (including baskets measured as a percentage of L2QA Pro Forma
EBITDA or Total Assets);

in each case, at the option of Altice International (Altice International’s election to exercise such option in
connection with any Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment, an “LCA Election”), the date of
determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder, shall be deemed to be the date the definitive
agreements or irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment are entered
into or has been delivered, as applicable (the “LCA Test Date”). If, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited
Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment and the other transactions to be entered into in connection
therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at
the beginning of the most recent Six Month Period ending prior to the LCA Test Date for which internal
consolidated financial statements of Altice International are available, Altice International could have taken such
action on the relevant LCA Test Date in compliance with such ratio or basket, such ratio or basket shall be deemed
to have been complied with.

If Altice International has made an LCA Election and any of the ratios or baskets for which compliance was
determined or tested as of the LCA Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio or basket,
including due to fluctuations in L2QA Pro Forma EBITDA or Total Assets of Altice International or the Person
subject to such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment, at or prior to the consummation of the
relevant transaction or action, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such
fluctuations. If Altice International has made an LCA Election for any Limited Condition Acquisition or
Irrevocable Repayment, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio or basket availability with
respect to the Incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens, or the making of Asset Dispositions, mergers, the conveyance,
lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Altice International or the designation of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary or the making of Investments or Restricted Payments on or following the relevant LCA
Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable
Repayment is consummated or the definitive agreement or irrevocable notice, as applicable, for such Limited
Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment is terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited
Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment, any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis
assuming such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment and other transactions in connection
therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated.


-----

**Reserved Indebtedness**

For purposes of determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture which requires the calculation of the
Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or testing
baskets set forth in the Indenture (including baskets measured as a percentage of L2QA Pro Forma EBITDA or
Total Assets) in connection with (x) the Incurrence of any Indebtedness or (y) the Incurrence of any Lien, the
Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to treat all or any portion of the committed amount of any Indebtedness
(and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) which is to be Incurred (or
any commitment in respect thereof) or secured by such Lien, as the case may be (any such amount elected until
revoked as described below, an “Elected Amount”) as being Incurred as of such election date and (i) any
subsequent borrowing or re-borrowing of Indebtedness under such commitment (so long as the total amount under
such Indebtedness does not exceed the Elected Amount) shall not be deemed, for purposes of this calculation, to
be an Incurrence of additional Indebtedness or an additional Lien at such subsequent time, (ii) the Issuer may
revoke an election of an Elected Amount at any time after the election date, (iii) for purposes of all subsequent
calculations of Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, the Elected Amount (if any) shall be deemed to be outstanding (unless revoked in accordance with
clause (ii)), whether or not such amount is actually outstanding, so long as the applicable commitment remains
outstanding and (iv) for the purpose of clauses (1), 5(a), (8) and (16) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and clause (30) of the definition of Permitted Liens, solely to the
extent that the Elected Amount has been Incurred in reliance thereof (and has not be reclassified), the Elected
Amount (if any) shall be deemed to be outstanding under such provisions (unless revoked in accordance with
clause (ii)), whether or not such amount is actually outstanding, so long as the applicable commitment remains
outstanding.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note issued under the Indenture
when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 days after notice by the
Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its other
agreements under the Indenture; _provided_ that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture
provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports”, such period of continuance of such default
or breach shall be 90 days after notice described in this clause (3) is given;

(4) [Reserved];

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by Altice International or any
Restricted Subsidiary (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by Altice International or any Restricted
Subsidiary) other than Indebtedness owed to Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by the failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness at the Stated Maturity thereof
(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods provided in such Indebtedness) (“payment
_default”); or_

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross -acceleration
_provision”),_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has
been so accelerated, aggregates in excess of the greater of €250 million and 15% of L2QA Pro Forma
EBITDA;


-----

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer, Altice International or a
Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by the Issuer, Altice International or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries
that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of the greater of €250 million and 15% of L2QA Pro Forma EBITDA, exclusive of any amounts
that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for, which judgments are not paid,
discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default
_provision”);_

(8) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to Notes Collateral having a fair
market value in excess of the greater of €250 million and 15% of L2QA Pro Forma EBITDA for any
reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such
security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest created
thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable and the Issuer shall assert in writing that any such
security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days (the “security
_default provisions”); and_

(9) any Note Guarantee by Altice International or a Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary or
any group of Subsidiary Guarantors that taken together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary ceases
to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Note Guarantee or the
Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or
disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Note Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days
after the notice specified in the Indenture (the “guarantee provisions”).

However, a default under clauses (3), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
until the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify
the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (5), (7), (8) or (9) the Issuer does not cure such default
within the time specified in clauses (3), (5), (7), (8) or (9), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such
notice.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. If any other Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
may and, if directed by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, the
Trustee shall, declare all such Notes to be due and payable immediately. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have
notice of any Default or Event of Default (other than a payment default) unless a written notice of any event which
is in fact such a default is received by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the
Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under
“Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be
automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to
clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness, or the relevant
Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the
declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (i) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not
conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) all existing Events of Default,
except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that
became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not
enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.


-----

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or
existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or
Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture
at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee
has received, indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no
Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders representing at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested
the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, security and/or indemnity (including
by way of pre-funding) reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the
offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee
(on behalf of the Holders) or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee (on behalf of the Holders).

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee is aware, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the
degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse
to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial
to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action
under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such
action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a Responsible Officer of the
Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders
within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust
officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer
is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate
indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is
required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of
which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or
proposes to take in respect thereof.

With respect to any Default or Event of Default, the words “exists,” “is continuing” or similar expressions with
respect thereto shall mean that the Default or Event of Default has occurred and has not yet been cured or waived.
If any Default or Event of Default occurs due to (a) the failure by any person to take any action by a specified
time, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have been cured at the time, if any, that the applicable
person takes such action or (b) the taking of any action by any person that is not then permitted by the terms of
the Indenture or any other Notes Document, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to be cured on the
earlier to occur of (i) the date on which such action would be permitted at such time to be taken under the Indenture
and the other Notes Documents and (ii) the date on which such action is unwound or otherwise modified to the
extent necessary for such revised action to be permitted at such time by the Indenture and the other Notes
Documents. If any Default or Event of Default occurs that is subsequently cured (a “Cured Default”), any other
subsequent Default or Event of Default resulting from the taking or omitting to take any action by any person,


-----

which subsequent Default or Event of Default would not have arisen had the Cured Default not occurred, shall be
deemed to be cured automatically upon, and simultaneously with, the cure of the Cured Default. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this paragraph, a Default or Event of Default (the “Initial Default”) may not be cured
pursuant to this paragraph:

(a) in the case of an Initial Default described in clause (b) of the second sentence of this paragraph, if an
Officer of the Issuer had Knowledge at the time of taking any such action that such Initial Default had
occurred and was continuing; or

(b) if the Trustee shall have declared all the Notes to be due and payable immediately pursuant to the
provisions described under “Events of Default” prior to the date such Initial Default would have been
deemed to be cured under this paragraph.

For purposes of the paragraph above, “Knowledge” shall mean, with respect to an Officer of the Issuer, (i) the
actual knowledge of such individual or (ii) the knowledge that such individual would have obtained if such
individual had acted in good faith to discharge his or her duties with the same level of diligence and care as would
reasonably be expected from an officer in a substantially similar position.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with an Initial Default then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default
for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods
prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any
other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by
such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period
specified in the Indenture.

The Notes will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only
if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) to its satisfaction. It may not be
possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the
Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders
of such Notes to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with
the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain
exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with
a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes); provided, however that, if any amendment, waiver or
other modification will only affect the Notes of a series only the consent of the holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series (and not the consent of at least a majority of all
Notes then outstanding), as the case may be, shall be required. However, without the consent of Holders holding
not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of Notes (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), (provided, however that, if any amendment,
waiver or other modification will only affect the Notes of a series only the consent of the holders of at least 90%
of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series, as the case may be, shall be required
(and not the consent of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of all Notes then outstanding)), an
amendment, supplement or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver, supplement
or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, any payment pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or pursuant to the provisions of
the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock”);_

(3) reduce the principal of, or extend the Stated Maturity of, any Note;


-----

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may
be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption” (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, any payment pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or pursuant to the provisions of
the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock”);_

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note (except to the extent the currency
stated in the Notes has been succeeded or replaced pursuant to applicable law);

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to
such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes
in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an
exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the payor
agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by
the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration); or

(9) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in this sentence.

In addition, without the consent of at least 75% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding (provided,
_however, that, if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect the Notes of a series, only the_
consent of the holders of at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such
series, as the case may be (and not the consent of at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of all Notes then
outstanding) will be required), no amendment, supplement or waiver may, with respect to any Notes held by a
non-consenting Holder: (1) release any Guarantor or HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor, respectively, from any of its
obligations under its Note Guarantee, HOT Proceeds Note Guarantee, the Indenture or the HOT Proceeds Note,
as applicable, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, and the Intercreditor Agreement; or (2) release
any of the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Notes Collateral or the HOT Proceeds
Note Collateral, as applicable (to the extent any Notes Collateral or HOT Proceeds Note Collateral, as applicable,
so released in any transactions or series of transactions has a fair market value in excess of €25 million) other than
in accordance with the terms of, as applicable, the Security Documents, the HOT Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture, as applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and
the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under
any Notes Document;

(3) provide for the assumption of a successor Person of the obligations of any HOT Proceeds Note Obligor
under any HOT Proceeds Note Document;

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon Altice International or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) add to the covenants or provide for a HOT Proceeds Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Issuer or
surrender any right or power conferred upon HOT, a HOT Proceeds Note Guarantor or any Subsidiary
of HOT that is a Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or does
not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect
under the Notes Documents;


-----

(7) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Issuer or does not adversely
affect the rights or benefits to the Issuer in any material respect, in each case, under the HOT Proceeds
Note Documents or any other Issuer Proceeds Loan;

(8) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) for the issuance of
Additional Notes Incurred in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(9) provide for Altice International or a Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance
with the Indenture, to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes (including any provisions relating to the
release or limitations of such Additional Guarantees), to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes,
or to effectuate or confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note
Guarantee or Lien (including the Notes Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in
respect thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking
or amendment is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(10) to add Guarantees with respect to the HOT Proceeds Note, to add security to or for the benefit of the
HOT Proceeds Note, or to effectuate or confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or
retaking of any HOT Proceeds Note Guarantee or Lien (including the HOT Proceeds Note Collateral and
the HOT Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the HOT
Proceeds Note when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under
the Indenture or the HOT Security Documents, as applicable or any intercreditor agreement relating to
the HOT Proceeds Note;

(11) conform the text of the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Notes, the HOT
Proceeds Note Guarantees, the HOT Proceeds Note Documents or the HOT Proceeds Note to any
provision of this “Description of Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of Notes”
was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, a Note Guarantee, the Security
Documents, the Notes, the HOT Proceeds Note Guarantees, the HOT Proceeds Note Documents or the
HOT Proceeds Note;

(12) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant
to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Notes
Document;

(13) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interests”; or_

(14) after a HOT Direct Obligation Event, amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement or otherwise modify or
release the HOT Proceeds Note and the HOT Security Documents, as the case may be, to give effect to
a repayment or reduction in the aggregate principal amount of the HOT Proceeds Note.

For purposes of determining whether the holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes have taken any action
under the Indenture (other than with respect to a determination that only effects the Dollar Notes), the principal
amount of Dollar Notes shall be deemed to be the Euro Equivalent of such principal amount of such Dollar Notes
as of, as determined by the Issuer, (a) if a record date has been set with respect to the taking of such action, such
date, (b) any date that is within 30 days of such action being taken or (c) the Issue Date.

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and an Opinion of Counsel as set forth in the
Indenture.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any
amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such
Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of articles 470-1 to 470-19of the Luxembourg act dated 10 August
1915 on commercial companies, as amended, shall not apply in respect of the Notes.


-----

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will
publish notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver as required by such rules.

**Acts by Holders**

Except as otherwise provided under “Optional Redemption”, in determining whether the Holders of the required
principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by Altice
International or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect
common control with Altice International will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture (“legal
_defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including_
those respecting the right to receive payment, defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of
an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders
of the Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time
will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations under certain covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants” and “Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under_
“Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross-acceleration
provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer, Altice International and Significant Subsidiaries,
the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “Events
_of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”)._

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option with respect to the Notes,
payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the
Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to the first paragraph
and clauses (1) and (2) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation”), (5), (6) (with respect only to Altice International and Significant Subsidiaries), (7), (8) or_
(9) under “Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee (or an entity designated or appointed as agent by it for this purpose) cash in U.S. dollars or U.S.
dollar-denominated U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof (in the case of the Dollar Notes) and
cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof (in the case of the
Euro Notes) for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity,
as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to customary exceptions and exclusions) from United States counsel to
the effect that Holders or beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the
case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such
Opinion of Counsel from United States counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal defeasance
or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with; and


-----

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is
qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except
as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture)
as to all outstanding Notes (or all outstanding Euro Notes or Dollar Notes, as applicable) when (1) either (a) all
the Notes (or all outstanding Euro Notes and Dollar Notes, as applicable) previously authenticated and delivered
(other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment was
previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the relevant
Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes (or all outstanding Euro Notes or Dollar Notes, as applicable) not
previously delivered to the relevant Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will
become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within
one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the
Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with
the Trustee (or an entity designated or appointed as agent by it for this purpose), cash in U.S. dollars or U.S.
dollar-denominated U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof (in the case of the Dollar Notes) and
cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof (in the case of the
Euro Notes), in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not previously
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the
case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may
be; _provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount_
deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee
equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the
date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the
Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption and any deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered
to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such deficit that confirms that such deficit shall be applied toward
such redemption; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the
Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to apply the deposited money toward payment of the Notes (or all
outstanding Euro Notes or Dollar Notes, as applicable) at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be;
and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that all conditions precedent
under the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture have been complied with.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, Altice International or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws, and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Listing and General Information**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list
the Notes on the Exchange will be approved, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this
listing.

So long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules and regulations of the Exchange shall so require,
copies, current and future, of all of Altice International’s annual audited consolidated financial statements, Altice
International’s unaudited consolidated interim quarterly financial statements and this Offering Memorandum may
be obtained, free of charge, during normal business hours at the registered office of the Issuer.


-----

**Available Information**

Anyone who receives this Offering Memorandum prior to the Issue Date, any Holder of the Notes or holder of a
beneficial interest in the Notes, following the Issue Date, may obtain a copy of the Indenture, the form of Notes,
the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement without charge by writing to the Issuer, 5, rue Eugène
Ruppert, L-2453 Luxembourg, Attention: Chief Financial Officer.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as
are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which the Trustee has
been notified in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and
powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in
conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action
enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Issuer shall deliver written notice to the Trustee within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the occurrence
of a Default or Event of Default. The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should
it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property
received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee, the Paying Agents and the Registrars
will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification and/or security of the Trustee by the Issuer and the
Guarantors for any loss, liability, taxes or expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad
faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders will be validly given if mailed or delivered to them at their respective addresses in the
register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrars. In addition, for so long as any of the Notes are listed
on the Exchange and the rules and regulations of the Exchange so require, notices with respect to such Notes will
be published as required by such rules.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect
to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether
or not the addressee receives it.

For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream for
communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will be
prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor
for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment of
interest.


-----

**Currency Indemnity**

The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors under or in
connection with the Dollar Notes and Note Guarantees thereof is U.S. dollars and the Euro Notes and Note
Guarantees thereof is euro, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than U.S.
dollars or euro, as applicable, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the
Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a
discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the U.S. dollar amount or euro amount,
as the case may be, which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other
currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on
the first date on which it is practicable to do so). If that U.S. dollar amount or euro amount is less than the U.S.
dollar amount or euro amount, as applicable, expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Note,
the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a
result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several
basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will
be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making
any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective
of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein)
and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount
in respect of any sum due under any Note, any Note Guarantee or to the Trustee.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer, Altice International and the other Guarantors are located outside
the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any
redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, may not be collectable
within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

Each series of the Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by
one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes”).
The Regulation S Global Notes representing the Dollar Notes (the “Dollar Regulation S Global Notes”) will be
deposited upon issuance with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as custodian for DTC and registered in
the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. The Regulation S Global Notes representing the Euro Notes (the
“Euro Regulation S Global Notes”) will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depository and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each series of the Notes sold within the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” pursuant to Rule 144A
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“144A Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The 144A Global
Notes representing the Dollar Notes (the “Dollar 144A Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as
nominee of DTC. The 144A Global Notes representing the Euro Notes (the “Euro 144A Global Notes”) will be
deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Dollar 144A Global Notes and the Dollar Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to herein as the
“Dollar Global Notes”. The Euro 144A Global Notes and the Euro Regulation S Global Notes are collectively
referred to herein as the “Euro Global Notes”.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of interests
in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the 144A BookEntry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear
and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be
shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Euro Global Notes will be issued
only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and the Book-Entry
Interests in the Dollar Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with
the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the
United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in
definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.
In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interest in the Global Notes will not have the Notes
registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be
considered the registered owners or “holders” of the Notes, under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositaries for DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or
their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes
under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of
holders under the Indenture.

Neither we, the Registrars, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as custodian for DTC, the common
depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream nor the Trustee under the Indenture nor any of our or
their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the BookEntry Interests.

In accordance with Article 100-14 paragraph 2 of the Luxembourg Law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial
companies, as amended, the application of the provisions set out in Articles 470-1 to 470-19 is expressly excluded.


-----

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered form
(the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

- if DTC (with respect to the Dollar Global Notes), or Euroclear and Clearstream (with respect to the Euro
Global Notes) notify the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a successor
depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days,

- if DTC (with respect to the Dollar Global Notes), or Euroclear or Clearstream (with respect to the Euro Global
Notes) so requests following an event of default under the Indenture, or

- if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through DTC, Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture.

In such an event, the Registrars will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued
in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable,
or the Issuer (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes
will bear the restrictive legend referred to in “Notice to Investors”, unless that legend is not required by the
Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents and the Registrars
shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will
be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the applicable Global Notes will be evidenced
through registration from time to time in the register maintained by the Registrars, and such registration is a means
of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes, however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests
may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in DTC, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of
the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such
Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will
be equal to the amount received by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the
redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that under existing practices of DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to
prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate, provided, however, that no Book-Entry
Interest of less than €100,000, in the case of the Euro Global Notes, or $200,000, in the case of the Dollar Global
Notes, principal amount at maturity, or less, may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest, additional
interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Euro Paying Agent (in respect of the Euro Notes)
and/or the U.S. Paying Agent (in respect of the Dollar Notes). The Euro Paying Agent will, in turn, make such
payments to Euroclear and Clearstream (in the case of the Euro Global Notes) and the U.S. Paying Agent will, in
turn, make such payments to DTC or its nominee (in the case of the Dollar Global Notes), which will distribute
such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee the Registrars, the Transfer Agents and the Paying Agents
will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (for example, DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream (or their
respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrars the Transfer Agents nor the Paying Agents or any of
their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:


-----

- any aspects of the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by DTC, Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records
of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating o, or payments made on
account of, a Book-Entry Interest, or

- payments made by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, or

- DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary or the custodian.

Payments made by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street
name”.

**Currency and Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Euro Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes (each a “Euroclear/Clearstream Holder” and together,
the “Euroclear/Clearstream Holders”) through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in euro. The
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Dollar Global Notes
will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes (each a “DTC Holder” and together, the “DTC Holders”) through
DTC in U.S. dollars.

Notwithstanding the payment provisions described above, Euroclear/Clearstream Holders may elect to receive
payments in respect of the Euro Global Notes in U.S. dollars and DTC Holders may elect to receive payments in
respect of the Dollar Global Notes in euro.

If so elected, a Euroclear/Clearstream Holder may receive payments of amounts payable in respect of its interest
in the Euro Global Notes in U.S. dollars in accordance with Euroclear or Clearstream’s customary procedures,
which include, among other things, giving to Euroclear or Clearstream, as appropriate, a notice of such holder’s
election. All costs of conversion resulting from any such election will be borne by such Euroclear/Clearstream
Holder.

If so elected, a DTC Holder may receive payment of amounts payable in respect of its interest in the Dollar Global
Notes in euro in accordance with DTC’s customary procedures, which include, among other things, giving to DTC
a notice of such holder’s election to receive payments in euro. All costs of conversion resulting from any such
election will be borne by such DTC Holder.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of the Notes (including the presentation of the Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction
of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only
in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which such participant or
participants has or have given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in
the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if
there is an event of default under the Indenture, each of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to
exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive
Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC will be done in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in
immediately available funds and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in
accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. If a holder requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical


-----

delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes
in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors”. Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors”.

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes and the
closing of the offering (the “40-day Period”), beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated
in the same currency only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the
Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a
person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A
in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions
described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the
United States and other jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the 40-day Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to
a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated in the
same currency without compliance with these certification requirements.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt by the
Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such
transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A (if available).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors”, Book-Entry Interests may be transferred and
exchanged as described under “Description of Notes—Transfer and Exchange”. Any Book-Entry Interest in one
of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the
other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the firstmentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as
described under “Description of Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first
delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer
will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors”.

This paragraph refers to transfers and exchanges with respect to Dollar Global Notes only. Transfers involving an
exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for 144A Book-Entry Interest in a Dollar Global Note will be
effected by DTC by means of an instruction originating from the Trustee through the DTC Deposit/Withdrawal
Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to
reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase
in the principal amount of the corresponding 144A Global Note. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit
transfers of unrestricted Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the 40 days
after the date of initial issuance of the Notes. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred
to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer,
cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such
other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other
procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a BookEntry Interest.

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience
of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system
and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Registrars and the Transfer
Agents nor the Initial Purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised the Issuer
that it is:


-----

- a limited purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law,

- a “banking organization” within the meaning of New York Banking Law,

- a member of the Federal Reserve System,

- a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and

- a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provision of Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act.

DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal
debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates
the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities,
through electronic book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC,
National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered
clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also
available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and
clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly
or indirectly.

Like DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic bookentry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among
other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and/or Clearstream is also available
to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian
relationship with a Euroclear and/or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions
in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global
Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be admitted to the Official List of the Exchange and
to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in
such Notes will therefore be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. The Issuer expects that
secondary trading in any certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. Subject to
compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Global Notes, cross market transfers between
participants in DTC, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be done
through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of each of Euroclear or Clearstream by its common
depositary, however, such cross market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or
Clearstream by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and regulations and within the
established deadlines of such system (Brussels time). Euroclear or Clearstream will, if the transaction meets its
settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the common depositary to take action to effect final settlement on
its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the Global Notes by DTC, and making and receiving payment in
accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement application to DTC. Euroclear participants and
Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the common depositary.

Because of the time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing
an interest in a Global Note from a participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to
the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be


-----

a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received
in Euroclear and Clearstream as a result of a sale of an interest in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or
Clearstream participant to a participant in DTC, will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC, but
will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear
or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers
of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they
are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrars, the Transfer Agents nor the Paying Agents will have any
responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro and U.S. dollars. Book-Entry Interests owned through DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement
date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List
of the Exchange. We expect that secondary trading in the Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds.

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.


-----

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”)) subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle
B of Title I of ERISA, a plan to which Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), applies, or any entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R.
Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) by reason of such an employee benefit plan’s and/or
plan’s investment in such entity (each, a “Benefit Plan Investor”), or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Certain Luxembourg Tax Considerations**

The following is a summary of certain Luxembourg material tax consequences of purchasing, owning and
disposing of the Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all tax considerations that may be
relevant to a decision to purchase or sell the Notes. It should be read in conjunction with “Risk Factors”. It is
based on the laws, regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations presently in force in Luxembourg,
although it is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice or to cover any and all types
of investors. Potential investors in the Notes should therefore consult their own professional advisors as to the
effects of state, local or foreign laws, including Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be subject.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for Luxembourg
income tax and net wealth tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax, duty, levy,
impost or other charge or withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only.
Also, please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax generally encompasses corporate income tax (impôt
_sur le revenu des collectivités), municipal business tax (impôt commercial communal) and a solidarity surcharge_
(contribution au fonds pour l’emploi) as well as personal income tax (impôt sur le revenu). Investors may further
be subject to net wealth tax (impôt sur la fortune) as well as other duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income tax
and municipal business tax as well as the solidarity surcharge invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers resident
of Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal income tax and the
solidarity surcharge. Under certain circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the
management of a professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.

**_Withholding Tax_**

(i) Nonresident Noteholders

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force, there is no withholding tax on payments of principal,
premium or non-participating interests made to Luxembourg non-resident holders of the Notes, nor on accrued
but unpaid non-participating interests in respect of the Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable
upon redemption or repurchase of Notes held by Luxembourg non-resident holders.

(ii) Resident Noteholders

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force and subject to the law of December 23, 2005, as amended
(the “December Law”), mentioned below, there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or
interest made to Luxembourg resident holder of Notes, nor on accrued but unpaid interest in respect of the Notes
nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of Notes held by Luxembourg
resident Noteholders.

Under the December Law, payments of interest or similar income made by a paying agent (within the meaning of
the December Law) established in Luxembourg to or for the benefit of an individual beneficial owner who is a
Luxembourg resident Investor may be subject to a final tax of 20%. Such withholding tax will be in full discharge
of income tax if the individual beneficial owner is an individual acting in the course of the management of his/her
private wealth. Responsibility for the withholding and payment of the tax will be assumed by the Luxembourg
paying agent. Payment of interest under the Notes coming within the scope of the December Law will be subject
to a withholding tax at a rate of 20%.

An individual beneficial owner of interest or similar income (within the meaning of the December Law) who is a
resident of Luxembourg may opt in accordance with the December Law to self declare and pay a final tax of 20%
when he/she receives such interest or similar income from a paying agent established in another EU Member State
or in a member state of the EEA which is not an EU Member State. In such case, the 20% levy is calculated on
the same amounts as for the payments made by Luxembourg resident paying agent. The option for the 20% final
levy must cover all payments of interest or similar income made by the paying agent to the Luxembourg resident
beneficial owner during the entire civil year. The individual resident who is the beneficial owner of interest is
responsible for the declaration and the payment of the 20% final tax.


-----

**_Income Taxation_**

(i) Nonresident Noteholders

Nonresident Noteholders, not having a permanent establishment, a permanent representative or a fixed place of
business in Luxembourg to which the Notes or income thereon are attributable, are not subject to Luxembourg
income taxes on interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes nor on
capital gains realized on the disposal or redemption of the Notes. Non-residents corporate holders or an individual
holder of Notes acting in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking, who have a
permanent establishment, a permanent representative or a fixed place of business in Luxembourg to which or to
whom the Notes or income therefrom are attributable are subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest accrued
or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes and on any gains realized upon the sale or
disposal of the Notes.

(ii) Resident Noteholders

Noteholders who are residents of Luxembourg will not be liable for any Luxembourg income tax on repayment
of principal, if they subscribed or acquired the Notes at par.

_Individuals_

A resident Noteholder, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, is subject to Luxembourg
income tax in respect of interest or similar income received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the
Notes, except if (i) withholding tax has been levied on such payments in accordance with the December Law, or
(ii) the individual holder of the Notes has opted for the application of a 20% tax in full discharge of income tax in
accordance with the December Law, which applies if a payment of interest has been made by a paying agent
established in another EU Member State or in a member state of the EEA which is not an EU Member State.

A gain realized by an individual Noteholder, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth,
upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of Notes is not subject to Luxembourg income tax, provided
this sale or disposal took place more than six months after the Notes were acquired. However, any portion of such
gain corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest income is subject to Luxembourg income tax, except if tax has
been levied on such interest in accordance with the December Law.

Gains realized upon a disposal of the Notes by an individual Noteholder acting in the course of the management
of a professional or business undertaking and who is resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes are subject to
Luxembourg income taxes.

_Corporations_

A corporate resident Noteholder must include any interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue
discount, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes, in its taxable
income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes.

Luxembourg corporate resident Noteholders who benefit from a special tax regime, such as, for example, (i) an
undertaking for collective investment subject to the amended law of December 17, 2010, (ii) a specialized
investment fund governed by the amended law of February 13, 2007, (iii) a family wealth management company
governed by the amended law of May 11, 2007 or (iv) a reserved alternative investment fund governed by the law
of July 23, 2016 not having elected for the regime of investment company in risk capital, are exempt from income
taxes in Luxembourg and thus income derived from the Notes, as well as gains realized thereon, are not subject
to Luxembourg income taxes.

**_Net Wealth Taxation_**

_Individuals_

An individual Noteholder, whether he/she is resident in Luxembourg or not, is not subject to Luxembourg net
wealth tax on such Notes.


-----

_Corporations_

Luxembourg resident corporate Noteholders and non-resident Noteholders who have a permanent establishment
or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which the Notes are attributable, are subject to Luxembourg net
wealth tax on such Notes, except if the Noteholder is (i) an undertaking for collective investment subject to the
amended law of December 17, 2010, (ii) a securitization company governed by the amended law of March 22,
2004 on securitization (save for the minimum net wealth tax), (iii) a company governed by the amended law of
June 15, 2004 on venture capital vehicles (save for the minimum net wealth tax), (iv) a specialized investment
fund governed by the amended law of February 13, 2007, (v) a family wealth management company governed by
the amended law of May 11, 2007 or (vi) a reserved alternative investment fund governed by the law of July 23,
2016 on reserved alternative investment funds (save for the minimum net wealth tax applicable to reserved
alternative investment funds having elected for the regime of investment company in risk capital governed by the
law of June 15, 2004 on venture capital vehicles).

**_Other Taxes_**

There is no Luxembourg registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in Luxembourg by
the Noteholders as a consequence of the issuance of the Notes, nor will any of these taxes be payable as a
consequence of a subsequent transfer, redemption or repurchase of the Notes. However, a registration duty may
apply if the Notes are registered. A registration is required if the Notes (i) are appended to a deed which is
mandatorily subject to registration or (ii) are lodged with the notary for his records (déposés au rang des minutes
_d’un notaire). Finally, registration of the Notes may be made on a voluntary basis._

Where a Noteholder is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes at the time of his/her death, the Notes are
included in his/her taxable estate for inheritance tax assessment purposes.

Gift tax may be due on a gift or donation of Notes if embodied in a Luxembourg deed or recorded in Luxembourg.

**European Information Exchange Regimes**

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has developed a new global standard for the
automatic exchange of financial information between tax authorities (the “CRS”). Luxembourg is a signatory
jurisdiction to the CRS and has conducted its first exchange of information with tax authorities of other signatory
jurisdictions in September 2017, as regards reportable financial information gathered in relation to fiscal year
2016. The CRS has been implemented in Luxembourg via the law dated December 18, 2015 concerning the
automatic exchange of information on financial accounts and tax matters and implementing the EU Directive
2014/107/EU.

The CRS regulations may impose obligations on the Issuer and the Noteholders, if the Issuer is considered as a
Reporting Financial Institution (e.g., an Investment Entity) under the CRS, so that the latter could be required to
conduct due diligence and obtain (among other things) confirmation of the tax residency, tax identification number
and CRS classification of Noteholders in order to fulfil its own legal obligations.

**FATCA**

Luxembourg has entered into a Model I Intergovernmental Agreement implemented by the Luxembourg law of
July 24, 2015 (as amended) which requires Financial Institutions located in Luxembourg to report, when required,
information on Financial Accounts held by Specified US Persons, if any, to the Luxembourg tax authorities.

The FATCA regulations may impose obligations on the Issuer and the Noteholders, if the Issuer is considered as
a Reporting Financial Institution (e.g. an Investment Entity) under FATCA, so that the latter could be required to
conduct due diligence and obtain (among other things) confirmation of the tax residency, tax identification number
and FATCA classification of Noteholders in order to fulfil its own legal obligations.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a description of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations of the acquisition, ownership, and
disposition of the Notes by a U.S. Holder thereof as defined below, except for the discussion under “—FATCA”
and “—U.S. Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting”. This description only applies to Notes held as


-----

capital assets (generally, property held for investment) and does not address, except as set forth below, aspects of
U.S. federal income taxation that may be applicable to holders that are subject to special tax rules, such as:

- banks or other financial institutions;

- insurance companies;

- real estate investment trusts;

- individual retirement accounts or other tax deferred accounts;

- regulated investment companies;

- grantor trusts;

- tax-exempt organizations;

- persons that will own the Notes through partnerships or other pass-through entities;

- dealers or traders in securities or currencies;

- U.S. Holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;

- certain former citizens and long-term residents of the United States;

- U.S. Holders that use a mark-to-market method of accounting;

- persons that use the accrual method of accounting that are required to include certain amounts in income no
later than such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements; or

- U.S. Holders that will hold a Note as part of a position in a straddle or as part of a hedging, conversion or
integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Moreover, this description does not address the 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income, the U.S. federal
estate and gift tax or the alternative minimum tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of
the Notes and does not address the U.S. federal income tax treatment of holders that do not acquire the Notes as
part of the initial offering at their initial issue price (generally, in each case, the first price to the public at which a
substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money). Each prospective purchaser should consult its own tax advisor
with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of
the Notes.

This description is based on the Code, U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative
pronouncements and judicial decisions, each as available and in effect on the date hereof. All of the foregoing is
subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect, which could affect the tax
considerations described herein. No opinion of counsel to the Issuer or the holders or ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) has been or will be given with respect to any of the considerations discussed herein. No
assurances can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position different from
any of the tax considerations discussed below.

For purposes of this description, a U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of the Notes who for U.S. federal income tax
purposes is:

- a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

- a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) organized in
or under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, including the District of Columbia;

- an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or


-----

- a trust (1) that has validly elected to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (2)(a)
the administration over which a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision and (b) all of the substantial
decisions of which one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax
treatment of the partnership and a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner
and the activities of the partnership. Such partner or partnership should consult its own tax advisor as to its
consequences.

**Redemptions and Additional Amounts**

In certain circumstances, the Issuer may be obligated to or may elect to make payments in excess of stated interest
or principal of the Notes and/or redeem the Notes in advance of their stated maturity. The Issuer believes, and
intends to take the position, if required, that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments
because of, among other things, the possibility of such payments or redemption. This position is based in part on
assumptions, as of the date of issuance of the Notes, (1) regarding the likelihood that such payments will have to
be paid or that the Issuer will elect to pay such amounts and/or (2) relating to the expected yield to maturity of the
Notes. Assuming such position is respected, any such amounts paid to a U.S. Holder pursuant to any repurchase
or redemption would be taxable as described below in “—Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable
_Disposition” and any payments of additional amounts in respect of withholding taxes would be taxable as_
additional ordinary income when received or accrued, in accordance with such holder’s method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. Holder unless such holder discloses
its contrary position in the manner required by applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations. The IRS, however, may take
a position contrary to the Issuer’s position, which could affect the amount, timing and character of a U.S. Holder’s
income with respect to the Notes. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential
application to the Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof. This
discussion assumes that the Notes are not treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**Stated Interest**

Stated interest paid on the Notes generally will be treated as “qualified stated interest”. Payments of qualified
stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without
reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary
interest income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, as detailed below. The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated
interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the Issuer), or that is
treated as constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate.

Stated interest on the Euro Notes will be included in a U.S. Holder’s gross income in an amount equal to the U.S.
dollar value of the euros, including the amount of any withholding tax thereon, regardless of whether the euros
are converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting will
determine such U.S. dollar value using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt. A cash method U.S. Holder
generally will not realize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of the interest payment but may have foreign
currency gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros received. Generally, a U.S. Holder that uses
the accrual method of tax accounting will determine the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest income using the
average rate of exchange for the accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years,
at the average rate for the partial period within each taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may
make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be
changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the
last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year in the
case of a partial accrual period) or the spot rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of
the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will
recognize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of an interest payment if the exchange rate in effect on the
date the payment is received differs from the rate used in translating the accrual of that interest. The amount of
foreign currency gain or loss to be recognized by such U.S. Holder will be an amount equal to the difference
between the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (determined on the basis of the spot rate on the date
the interest income is received) in respect of the accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income
that has accrued during the accrual period (as determined above) regardless of whether the payment is converted
to U.S. dollars. This foreign currency gain or loss will be ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated
as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Foreign currency gain or loss generally will be U.S. source


-----

provided that the residence of a taxpayer is considered to be the United States for purposes of the rules regarding
foreign currency gain or loss.

Interest (including OID, if any, as described below) included in a U.S. Holder’s gross income with respect to the
Notes will be treated as foreign source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The limitation on non-U.S.
taxes eligible for the U.S. foreign tax credit is calculated separately with respect to specific “baskets” of income.
For this purpose, interest generally should constitute “passive category income”. Any non-U.S. withholding tax
paid by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to the U.S. Holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction
in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. U.S. Holders should
consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.

**Original Issue Discount**

One or more series of the Notes may be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A Note
will be treated as having been issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes if its “stated redemption price
at maturity” exceeds its issue price by at least the “OID de minimis amount”. The OID de minimis amount equals
1/4 of 1% of the debt instrument’s stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years
from its issue date to maturity. The “stated redemption price at maturity” of a Note is the sum of all payments
required to be made on the Note other than qualified stated interest payments.

If a Note is issued with OID, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income before the receipt
of the associated cash payment, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s accounting method for tax purposes. The amount
of OID with respect to a Note that a U.S. Holder must include in income is the sum of the “daily portions” of the
OID for the Note for each day during the taxable year (or portion of the taxable year) in which the U.S. Holder
held the Note. The daily portion is determined by allocating a pro rata portion of the OID for each day of the
accrual period. An accrual period may be of any length and the accrual periods may vary in length over the term
of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal
or interest occurs either on the first day of an accrual period or on the final day of an accrual period. The amount
of OID allocable to an accrual period is equal to the excess of (1) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the
Note at the beginning of the accrual period and its yield to maturity (computed on a constant yield method and
compounded at the end of each accrual period, taking into account the length of the particular accrual period) over
(2) the amount of any stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Note at the
beginning of any accrual period is generally the sum of the issue price of the Note plus the amount of OID allocable
to all prior accrual periods reduced by any payments on the Note that were not stated interest. The yield to maturity
of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments
to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note.

Under these rules, a U.S. Holder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in
successive accrual periods. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable
at maturity (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) and the “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of
the period. Under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, a U.S. Holder of a Note with OID may elect to include
in gross income all interest (including stated interest) that accrues on the Note using the constant yield method
described above. Once made with respect to the Note, the election cannot be revoked without the consent of the
IRS. A U.S. Holder considering an election under these rules should consult its own tax advisor.

U.S. Holders may obtain information regarding the amount of OID, if any, the issue price, the issue date and yield
to maturity by contacting the Issuer, 5, Rue Eugène Ruppert, L-2453 Luxembourg, Attn: Chief Financial Officer.

Any OID on a Euro Note generally will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated into U.S.
dollars in the same manner as stated interest accrued by an accrual basis U.S. Holder. Upon receipt of an amount
attributable to OID (whether in connection with a sale or disposition of such a Note or otherwise), a U.S. Holder
generally will recognize foreign currency gain or loss in an amount determined in the same manner as stated
interest received by an accrual basis U.S. Holder, as described above. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own
tax advisors regarding the interplay between the application of the OID and foreign currency exchange gain or
loss rules. For these purposes, all receipts on a Euro Note will be viewed first, as payments of stated interest
payable on the Note; second, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments
considered made for the earlier accrual periods first; and, third, as receipts of principal.

The rules regarding OID are complex. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the
application of these rules to their particular situations.


-----

**Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition**

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Note equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement
or other taxable disposition of the Note (less any amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will
be subject to tax in the manner described above under “—Stated Interest” to the extent not previously so taxed),
and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be its U.S. dollar cost increased by the amount of any
OID previously included in income and decreased by payments other than stated interest made with respect to the
Note. If a U.S. Holder purchases a Note with euros, the U.S. dollar cost of the Note generally will be the U.S.
dollar value of the purchase price on the date of purchase calculated at the spot rate of exchange on that date. The
amount realized upon the disposition of a Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the amount received on
the date of the disposition calculated at the spot rate of exchange on that date. However, if the Note is traded on
an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder (and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder) should
determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of or amount received on the Note, as applicable, by translating the
amount paid or received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or disposition, as
applicable. The election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in respect of the purchase and disposition of Notes
traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year
and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement,
or other taxable disposition of a Note will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the
U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than one year as of the date of disposition. Long-term capital gain of a
non-corporate U.S. Holder generally is taxed at preferential rates. The ability of a U.S. Holder to offset capital
losses against ordinary income is limited. Any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a Note generally will be treated as income from sources within the United States or loss
allocable to income from sources within the United States.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
Euro Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is attributable to
changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period in which the U.S. Holder held such Note. Such
foreign currency gain or loss will equal the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro
purchase price for the Euro Note calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of the sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for
the Euro Note calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase of the Note. The realization of any
foreign currency gain or loss, including foreign currency gain or loss with respect to amounts attributable to
accrued and unpaid stated interest and any OID, will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on
the disposition of the Notes.

**Possible Effect of Certain Transactions Including Reorganizations, Mergers and Consolidations**

The Issuer may engage in certain transactions, including without limitation reorganizations, mergers and
consolidations as described above under “Description of Notes—Merger and Consolidation”. Depending on the
circumstances, a change in the obligor of the Notes as a result of the transaction could result in a deemed taxable
exchange to a U.S. Holder and the modified Note could be treated as newly issued at that time, potentially resulting
in the recognition of taxable gain or loss.

The Issuer may be required to report certain information regarding such transaction that may be relevant to U.S.
Holders including (1) by filing Form 8937 with the IRS and providing copies to certain of its Holders or (2) by
posting the form on its website.

**Reportable Transaction Reporting**

Under certain U.S. Treasury Regulations, U.S. Holders that participate in “reportable transactions” (as defined in
the regulations) must attach to their U.S. federal income tax returns a disclosure statement on IRS Form 8886.
Under the relevant rules, a U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from the Notes
as a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the regulations. U.S. Holders should consult
their own tax advisors as to the possible obligation to file IRS Form 8886 with respect to the ownership or
disposition of the Notes, or any related transaction, including without limitation, the disposition of any non-U.S.


-----

currency received as interest or as proceeds from the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the
Notes.

**U.S. Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting**

Backup withholding and information reporting requirements may apply to certain payments of principal of, and
interest (including accruals of OID, if any) on, Notes and to proceeds from the sale, exchange, retirement or
disposition of Notes that are held by U.S. Holders. The payor will be required to withhold backup withholding tax
on payments made within the United States, or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman (and certain subsidiaries
thereof), on a Note to, or from gross proceeds on the sale or disposition of a Note paid to, a U.S. Holder, other
than an exempt recipient, if the holder fails to furnish its correct taxpayer identification number or otherwise fails
to comply with, or establish an exemption from, the backup withholding requirements. Payments within the United
States, or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman (and certain subsidiaries thereof), of principal and interest (including
OID, if any) and proceeds of a sale, exchange, retirement or disposition to a holder of a Note that is not a U.S.
person generally are subject to information reporting, but will not be subject to backup withholding tax if an
appropriate certification is timely provided by the holder to the payor and the payor does not have actual
knowledge or a reason to know that the certificate is incorrect.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a
holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. A holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under
the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS and furnishing any required
information in a timely manner.

Certain U.S. Holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes, subject to certain
exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in custodial accounts maintained by certain financial
institutions). U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this
requirement on their ownership and disposition of the Notes and the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**FATCA**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury and IRS guidance issued thereunder (collectively,
“FATCA”) generally imposes withholding at a rate of 30% on payments of interest made to any foreign entity on
debt obligations generating U.S. source interest or certain other debt obligations generating non-U.S. source
interest issued by a foreign financial institution, unless that foreign entity complies with certain reporting rules
under FATCA or otherwise qualifies for an exemption. Even if payments on the Notes are treated as paid from a
foreign financial institution and any portion of such payments is treated as a “foreign passthru payment”, the Notes
will be grandfathered because no final regulations defining a “foreign passthru payment” have been issued and
therefore are not subject to the FATCA withholding rules. If, however, the Notes are significantly modified at a
time when the grandfathering rules are no longer available, withholding may apply and holders and beneficial
owners of the Notes will not be entitled to receive any additional amounts to compensate them for any such
withholding. Grandfathering will not apply to the Notes to the extent the Notes are significantly modified more
than six months after the date final regulations defining a “foreign passthru payment” are published, although
FATCA withholding would not apply until two years from such date of publication. In addition, if additional
Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period and have the same ISIN or CUSIP as the Notes
issued hereby, then withholding agents may treat all notes, including the Notes issued hereby, as subject to
withholding under FATCA. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of a refund in that
circumstance. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and a foreign country where the Issuer,
a holder or intermediary is located may modify the requirements in this paragraph. Prospective holders should
consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in the
Notes.

**The above description is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences relating to**
**the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult**
**their own tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of their particular situations.**

**Israeli Taxes**

If interest is paid by an entity that is not considered a Luxembourg entity, other withholding taxes could apply. A
company considered an Israeli resident for tax purposes, or an Israeli permanent establishment of a non-Israeli
company, that pays interest on a note denominated in a foreign currency to an individual who is a non-Israeli


-----

resident is required to withhold tax at the rate of 25%. If the interest is paid to “material shareholders”, it will be
subject to tax according to their marginal tax rate (currently up to 47%). “Material shareholders” for this purpose
are shareholders who hold, directly or indirectly, including with others, at least 10% of any means of control in
the company. The aforementioned rates could be increased by 3% if the individual’s total income in Israel in the
relevant tax year exceeds approximately $185,000.

Payments of interest on a similar note to a corporate entity is subject to a withholding tax in accordance with the
applicable corporate tax rate for the year in which the interest is paid. The current corporate tax rate in Israel is
23%.

Taxes to be withheld from interest paid to non-Israeli residents (individuals or corporations) by an Israeli company
or an Israeli permanent establishment of a non-Israeli company, may be reduced under an applicable tax treaty.


-----

**CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN CONSIDERATIONS**

The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), imposes certain fiduciary
standards and certain other requirements on employee benefit plans subject to ERISA, including entities such as
collective investment funds, certain insurance company separate accounts, certain insurance company general
accounts, and entities whose underlying assets are treated as being subject to ERISA (collectively, “ERISA
**Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are**
subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of investment prudence and
diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents
governing the ERISA Plan. The prudence of a particular investment should be determined by the responsible
fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts
and circumstances of the investment, including, but not limited to, the matters discussed above under “Risk
_Factors” and the fact that in the future there may be no market in which such fiduciary will be able to sell or_
otherwise dispose of the Notes or any interest therein.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as those plans that are not subject to
ERISA but that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans
(together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”), and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” under ERISA or
“disqualified persons” under the Code) having certain relationships to Plans, unless a statutory or administrative
exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited
transaction may be subject to excise taxes or other liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and the transaction may
have to be rescinded.

Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of
ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may
nevertheless be subject to U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are substantially
similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar
**Laws”).**

In addition, if the Notes are acquired by a Plan with respect to which we, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee or any
of their respective affiliates is a party in interest or a disqualified person, such transaction could be deemed to be
a direct or indirect prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code. In addition, if a party in interest or disqualified person with respect to a Plan owns or acquires a 50% or
more beneficial interest in the Issuer, the acquisition or holding of the Notes by or on behalf of such Plan could
be considered to constitute a prohibited transaction. Moreover, the acquisition or holding of the Notes or other
indebtedness issued by the Issuer by or on behalf of a party in interest or disqualified person with respect to a Plan
that owns or acquires an equity interest in the Issuer also could give rise to a prohibited transaction. Certain
exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code could be applicable,
however, to a Plan’s acquisition of a Note depending in part upon the type of fiduciary making the decision to
acquire a Note and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are
Prohibited Transaction Exemption (“PTE”) 84–14, regarding transactions effected by a “qualified professional
asset manager”; PTE 90–1, regarding investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts; PTE 91–38,
regarding investments by bank collective investment funds; PTE 95–60, regarding investments by insurance
company general accounts and PTE 96–23, regarding investments by certain “in house asset managers”. In
addition to the class exemptions listed above, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code
provide a statutory prohibited transaction exemption for transactions between a Plan and a person or entity that is
a party in interest to such Plan solely by reason of being (or being affiliated with) a provider of services to the
Plan (other than a party in interest that is a fiduciary, or its affiliate, that has or exercises discretionary authority
or control or renders investment advice with respect to the assets of the Plan involved in the transaction), provided
that the Plan receives no less, and pays no more than “adequate consideration” (within the meaning of
Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(f)(10) of the Code) in connection with the transaction. Even if the
conditions specified in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of the relief provided by these
exemptions might not cover all acts which might be construed as prohibited transactions.

Each of us, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee and certain other parties, or their respective affiliates, may be the
sponsor of, or fiduciary to, one or more Plans. Because such parties may receive certain benefits in connection
with the sale of the Notes to such Plans, the purchase of such Notes using the assets of a Plan over which any of


-----

such parties is the sponsor or a fiduciary might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available.

Under ERISA and a regulation issued by the U.S. Department of Labor at 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as
modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the “Plan Asset Regulation”), the assets of an entity that is neither a
publicly-offered security nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the U.S. Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) will be deemed to constitute “plan assets”
for the purposes of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code if a “Benefit Plan Investor” (within the meaning of
Section 3(42) of ERISA) acquires an “equity interest” in the entity and none of the exceptions contained in the
Plan Asset Regulation is applicable. An equity interest is defined under the Plan Asset Regulation as an interest
other than an instrument which is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and which has no substantial
equity features. Under the exceptions in the Plan Asset Regulation, an entity will not be deemed to hold plan assets
if (i) participation in the entity by Benefit Plan Investors is not “significant” (e.g., Benefit Plan Investors hold less
than 25% of the total value of each class of equity interest in the entity), or (ii) the entity is an operating company,
including a “venture capital operating company” or “real estate operating company”.

Although there is little guidance on the subject, it is intended that, at the time of their issuance, the Notes should
not be treated as equity interests of the Issuer for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation.

EACH ACQUIRER AND EACH TRANSFEREE OF A NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN WILL BE
DEEMED TO REPRESENT, WARRANT AND AGREE AT THE TIME OF ITS ACQUISITION AND
THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THAT IT HOLDS SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN, THAT
(1) EITHER (A) IT IS NOT, AND IS NOT ACTING ON BEHALF OF (AND FOR SO LONG AS IT HOLDS
SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN IT WILL NOT BE, AND WILL NOT BE ACTING ON BEHALF
OF), A BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR OR A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN WHICH IS
SUBJECT TO ANY SIMILAR LAWS AND NO PART OF THE ASSETS USED BY IT TO ACQUIRE OR
HOLD SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN CONSTITUTES THE ASSETS OF ANY BENEFIT
PLAN INVESTOR OR SUCH A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN, OR (B) ITS
ACQUISITION, HOLDING AND DISPOSITION OF SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN DOES
NOT AND WILL NOT CONSTITUTE OR RESULT IN A NON-EXEMPT PROHIBITED TRANSACTION
UNDER SECTION 406 OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE (OR, IN THE CASE OF A
GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN, A VIOLATION OF ANY SIMILAR LAWS); AND
(2) NEITHER THE ISSUER NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES IS UNDERTAKING TO ACT AS A
“FIDUCIARY” (WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 3(21) OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE
OR, WITH RESPECT TO A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN, ANY DEFINITION OF
“FIDUCIARY” UNDER SIMILAR LAWS) WITH RESPECT TO THE PURCHASER OR HOLDER IN
CONNECTION WITH ANY PURCHASE OR HOLDING OF THE NOTES, OR AS A RESULT OF ANY
EXERCISE BY THE ISSUER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OF ANY RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH
THE NOTES, AND NO ADVICE PROVIDED BY THE ISSUER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS
FORMED A PRIMARY BASIS FOR ANY INVESTMENT DECISION BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE
PURCHASER OR HOLDER IN CONNECTION WITH THE NOTES.

WE, THE INITIAL PURCHASERS AND THE TRUSTEE, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, SHALL
BE ENTITLED TO CONCLUSIVELY RELY UPON THE TRUTH AND ACCURACY OF THE FOREGOING
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS BY ACQUIRERS AND TRANSFEREES OF
ANY NOTES (OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN) WITHOUT FURTHER INQUIRY.

It should be noted that an insurance company’s general account may be deemed to include assets of Plans under
certain circumstances, e.g., where a Plan purchases an annuity contract issued by such an insurance company,
based on the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust
and Savings Bank, 510 U.S. 86 (1993). An insurance company considering the purchase of Notes with assets of
its general account should consider such purchase and the insurance company’s ability to make the representations
described above in light of John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, Section 401(c)
of ERISA and the U.S. Department of Labor regulation at 29 C.F.R. Section 2550.401c-1.

A fiduciary of an ERISA Plan or other employee benefit plan that is subject to Similar Laws, prior to investing in
the Notes or any interest therein, should take into account, among other considerations, whether the fiduciary has
the authority to make the investment; the composition of the plan’s portfolio with respect to diversification by
type of asset; the plan’s funding objectives; the tax effects of the investment; and whether, under the general
fiduciary standards of ERISA or other applicable laws, including investment prudence and diversification, an


-----

investment in the Notes or any interest therein is appropriate for the plan, taking into account the plan’s particular
circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment, including such matters as the overall
investment policy of the plan and the composition of the plan’s investment portfolio.

The sale of any Note or any interest therein to a Plan or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan that is subject
to any Similar Laws is in no respect a representation by us, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee, or any of their
respective affiliates, that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by
such plans generally or any particular plan; that the prohibited transaction exemptions described above, or any
other prohibited transaction exemption, would apply to such an investment by such plan in general or any
particular plan; or that such an investment is appropriate for such plans generally or any particular plan.

The discussion of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code contained in this Offering Memorandum, is, of necessity,
general, and does not purport to be complete. Moreover, the provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code
are subject to extensive and continuing administrative and judicial interpretation and review. Therefore, the
matters discussed above may be affected by future regulations, rulings and court decisions, some of which may
have retroactive application and effect.

Any Plan or employee benefit plan not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and any fiduciary thereof,
proposing to invest in the Notes or any interest therein should consult with its legal advisors regarding the
applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the
Code and any Similar Laws, to such investment, and to confirm that such investment will not constitute or result
in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of any applicable requirement of ERISA,
Section 4975 of the Code or Similar Laws.

**LIMITATION ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE**
**SECURITY INTERESTS**

Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the Senior Secured
Collateral in each of the jurisdictions in which the Issuer and the Guarantors are organized.

**European Union**

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings recast, as modified (the
“Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the EU (other than Denmark), the courts of the EU Member
State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the Insolvency
Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The
determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the
different EU Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation that a debtor has its
center of main interests in the EU Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the
contrary, Preamble 30 of the Insolvency Regulation states that the center of main interests of a “debtor should
correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis, which is
therefore ascertainable by third parties”. The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in
determining the center of main interests of a debtor, including in particular where board meetings are held, the
location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the
majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s center of main interests is not a static concept and
may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent
jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

If the center of main interests of a debtor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office,
the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the Insolvency Regulation would be commenced
in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of
insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced
in one EU Member State under the Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States
(other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another EU Member State.

If the center of main interests of a debtor is in an EU Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of
the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to
commence secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an
“establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency Regulation) in the territory
of such other EU Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean a place of operations where the debtor
carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods.

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the EU Member State in which the debtor has its center of
main interests, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another EU Member State in which the debtor has
an establishment (secondary proceedings) are limited to “winding up proceedings” listed in Annex A of the
Insolvency Regulation. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated
in the territory of such other EU Member State. Where main proceedings in the EU Member State in which the
debtor has its center of main interests have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only
be commenced in another EU Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency
proceedings cannot be commenced in the EU Member State in which the debtor’s center of main interests is
situated under that EU Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the
request of a creditor which is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the other EU Member
State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment. Irrespective of whether the insolvency
proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions,
be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over
the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all EU Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing
main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other EU Member States so long as no secondary
proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in an EU Member
State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s center of main interests is there)
may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that EU Member State in another EU Member State (such


-----

as to remove assets of the debtor from that other EU Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no
insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other EU Member State or no preservation measures have
been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other EU Member
State where the debtor has assets.

Following the entry into force of the Insolvency Regulation, there is an increased scrutiny in situations where
there has been a recent COMI shift. Where a company’s COMI has shifted in the preceding three months the
rebuttable presumption that its COMI is at the place of its registered office will no longer apply. Also, the opening
of secondary proceedings in another EU Member State - which will no longer be limited only to “winding-up
proceedings”—will be possible not only if the debtor has an establishment in such EU Member State at the time
of the opening of main insolvency proceedings, but also if the debtor had an establishment in such EU Member
State in the three-month period prior to the request of opening of main insolvency proceedings.

**Israel**

**_General Corporate Power_**

The Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999 requires a company to indicate its purpose in its articles of association.
Thus, the general corporate capacity of an Israeli company to provide a guarantee or security may be limited by
its organizational documents (i.e. its articles of association).

Subject to any specific provision in a company’s organizational documents, a grant of security or a guarantee by
an Israeli company would generally require the approval of its board of directors, absent the existence of any
interested party transactions. Refinancing Transactions involving interested parties may also require approvals of
the shareholders, audit committee and/or independent directors.

**_Limitation on Distributions and Fiduciary Duties_**

Under Israeli law, in certain circumstances, a company’s undertaking to guarantee or provide security for the
benefit of its parent company with respect to an amount in excess of the amounts actually received by such
company (i.e., with respect to excess amounts received by other entities), will result in the excess being a
“distribution” under Israeli law, which term also includes a company purchasing its own shares or assisting with
the purchase thereof. Under Israeli law, a company may only make distributions up to the amount of the greater
of: (i) its retained earnings and (ii) its cumulative net income over the preceding eight quarters (and provided that
it meets the Solvency Test as defined under Israeli law) (“Distributable Profits”). Distributable Profits will be
reduced by the amount of prior distributions to the extent not already reflected in the calculation of Distributable
Profits. Any distribution which is not out of Distributable Profits will require court approval.

The fiduciary duty of directors requires that they act in the best interests of the company. Thus, the board of
directors must determine in each case whether granting a guarantee or security interest is in the best interest of the
company.

**_Security Interests_**

Under Israeli law, there are generally two types of charges, a fixed charge and a floating charge. A fixed charge
is the charge of a certain asset as a security until the debt secured by the charge is settled. A floating charge is a
charge over all or an unspecified part of the assets of a company, including its future assets. Unless otherwise
specifically stated, a floating charge would include all of a pledging company’s assets that by their nature may
change from time to time in accordance with the company’s business and the nature of its operations. Generally
and unless otherwise restricted pursuant to the debenture under which it is created, a floating charge does not
restrict the company’s conduct in its ordinary course, the sale of the charged assets in the ordinary course of
business, or the imposition of additional charges and liens on the company’s assets. When the floating charge
crystallizes (for example, upon a default), it becomes, in effect, a fixed charge over all the company’s assets at the
time of crystallization.

A security interest is generally created by an agreement between the company and the creditor (certain security
interests by operation of law excluded). The security is perfected against third parties if registered with the
Companies Registrar within 21 days of its creation (or, if created by a non-Israeli company, upon registration with
the Registrar of Pledges); however, certain charges may be perfected by the possession of the asset by the creditor
or its agent. A charge over real-estate of a company (a “mortgage”) must also be registered with the Land Registry


-----

Bureau. Charges over vessels, patents, trademarks and other assets subject to separate government registrars may
be also registered with such registrars.

**_Enforcement of Guarantee and Securities_**

_General_

A guarantee is governed by the Guarantee Law, 5727-1967 and is generally enforced as a contract under Israeli
law.

Under Israeli law, the realization of a pledge generally requires a court order or, with respect to certain assets, an
order from the Office of Execution of Judgments and as a practical matter generally results in the appointment of
a receiver to manage the assets under supervision of the court. Certain limited exemptions allowing for selfrealization apply with respect to certain pledges in favor of certain institutional entities (namely a “Banking
Institution” under Israeli law, the Bank of Israel, Israeli insurance companies, Israeli Provident Funds
Management Companies, and members of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange) and certain securities pledges in favor
of certain institutional entities. Certain terms and conditions apply to any such “self help” realization procedures
including, without limitation, the obligation to provide notice and the obligation to sell the pledged assets in the
manner common in the applicable market of the asset (and in the absence of such market, in a reasonable
commercial manner).

Israeli courts would apply Israeli law for the creation, perfection, and enforcement of a security created by an
Israeli company over its assets located in Israel. In addition, Israeli courts would generally apply Israeli law for
the creation, perfection and enforcement of a security created by a non-Israeli company over shares physically
located in Israel.

_Insolvency_

On September 15, 2019, the new Insolvency and Rehabilitation law, 2018 came into effect (the “IRL”). Under
the IRL, if a company is determined by the court to be insolvent, based on an application made by the company
or by a creditor thereof, through an order issued by the court, it shall be placed either into rehabilitation
proceedings or into liquidation proceedings (the “Initiation Order”). Upon the issuance of an Initiation Order
with respect to an Israeli company (or a company having business or assets in Israel), an automatic stay of
proceedings shall apply and the court will appoint a trustee who shall act for the liquidation or rehabilitation of
the company (the “Trustee”). The court may also impose a stay of proceeding prior to the granting of the Initiation
Order.

As long as the stay of proceedings is in effect, the continuance or commencement of any proceeding against the
company is prohibited other than with the permission of the court, and in the rehabilitation path secured creditors
are restricted from enforcing their collateral during the stay period, unless the court is convinced that either (i) no
adequate protection exists to safeguard the secured creditor's rights or (ii) enforcement of the secured creditor’s
rights will not jeopardize the ability of the company to rehabilitate. However, in the liquidation path, a creditor
holding a fixed charge must only notify the Trustee of his intention to enforce his security and the following would
apply: if the charged asset(s) worth more than the debt to such creditor, the Trustee will monitor the sale of such
asset, and if the debt is higher than the value of the secured asset, the secured creditor may carry out the sale
without the supervision of the Trustee (but through an application to the court). Any balance from the realization
exceeding the secured debt will form part of the estate to be distributed by the Trustee to the unsecured creditors.
If the value of the security is less than the value of the debt, then the secured creditor may recover the balance of
the sum owed to it (exceeding such value) pari passu with the unsecured creditors.

A creditor having a floating charge (as opposed to a fixed charge), would only be entitled to 75% of the sale
proceeds, and the rest of the proceeds will be distributed to unsecured creditors. The rest of the debt owed to such
creditor would be deemed as unsecured debt. However, this rule does not apply to a company on the assets of
which any floating charge was registered prior to September 15, 2019, provided that: (a) the charge was granted
in connection with debt incurred prior to September 15, 2019, and no change was made to the term or to the
interest rate of such debt; or (b) the insolvency proceedings were initiated not later than 18 months after September
15, 2019 (i.e. September 15, 2023).

The insolvency court may annul any transaction entered into by the company with a creditor within three months
(one year, with respect to an affiliated creditor) prior to filing of the application for Initiation Order, if at the time


-----

of such transaction the debtor was insolvent (with a presumption that the debtor was insolvent, unless proved
otherwise) and due to such transaction such creditor will receive a larger portion of the debt compared to the part
that it would have received under the insolvency proceedings according to its priority. In addition, the insolvency
court may annul any transaction entered into by the company with any third party within two years (four years,
with respect to an affiliated third party) prior to filing of an application for Initiation Order, if at the time of such
transaction the debtor was insolvent (with a presumption that the debtor was insolvent, unless proved otherwise)
or the transaction caused the debtor to be insolvency and such transaction took an asset out of the company’s
possession with no appropriate consideration paid to the company. Any such transaction that was made with an
intent of deceiving creditors may be annulled if entered into by the company within seven years prior to the filing
of petition for initiation order.

_Special Regulatory Approvals_

The approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications is required prior to the realization of the security interest
granted (whether directly or indirectly) over the shares of Cool Holding. There is no set time period for review by
the Israeli Ministry of Communications and such approval may be withheld or delayed by the Israeli Ministry of
Communications in its sole discretion.

_Protected Negotiations_

Israeli Law permits certain companies to limit the rights of creditors, for a period of up to six months, in order to
enable the conduct of negotiations for an arrangement with creditors without any court filing. This measure may
be taken only by a publicly traded company and only if the board of directors of the company confirms that the
company is not in a default under any debt that was due and there is no real concern that the company will not be
able to pay its debts which are due during the successive nine months.

During the protected negotiations period, the company will enjoy the following advantages with respect to each
creditor to which a notice of protected negotiations was given: Such creditor will not be permitted to apply for a
commencement of insolvency proceedings; he will not be permitted to apply to court for approval of an
arrangement of debts proposed by him; and he will not be permitted to accelerate his debt (although this period
may be shortened to 45 days).

_Priority of Claims_

Generally, the priority of claims on an insolvent company’s assets will be determined in the following order:

1. Secured Creditors (excluding, however, any interest in arrears or other late payment fines accrued from
the date of the Initiation Order and until the actual repayment of the secured debt. Any such penalty
interest accrued after such date will be paid only after unsecured creditors were paid in full);

2. Insolvency proceedings expenses;

3. Preferential creditors, in the following order: employee wages (up to certain caps), income tax and social
security payments withheld by the company, VAT debt (exclusive of any interest) accrued in the 12
months period prior to the issuance of the Initiation Order, and some other limited tax debts;

4. Pledgees under floating charges, subject to the limitations described above;

5. Unsecured creditors (exclusive of interest in arrears);

6. Payments to secured creditors of interest in arrears accrued after the date of the Initiation Order and
payments to unsecured creditors of any interest accrued until the date of the Initiation Order;

7. Punitive payments imposed on the debtor; and

8. Payments to Shareholders.

**Luxembourg**

**_Security Interests_**

The conditions to be satisfied by the granting of security interests relate to (i) corporate power, (ii) corporate
authority and (iii) corporate benefit. These rules are derived from general principles and must be applied to
specific circumstances, which have to be analyzed on a case by case basis.

_Corporate power_

Limits on corporate power can be imposed either by (i) law or (ii) the articles of association of the Issuer.

1. Limitations imposed by law.

Pursuant to the Luxembourg Civil Code, a company is incorporated with a view to participate in the profits (and
the losses) which may arise therefrom. The goal to share the profits is an essential element of every company and
therefore, a purely free (or gratuitous) act, without consideration, may be outside the scope of the activities of a
company as contemplated by law. A company may however carry out gratuitous acts whenever these acts are
accomplished with a view to the realization, directly or indirectly, of the Issuer’s corporate objective. It is normally
understood that except in exceptional circumstances, an intragroup security is a type of act which may serve the
purpose of realizing a profit.

Thus, it is only in exceptional circumstances where there is no reasonable indirect potential benefit of, or a
motivated interest for, a proposed guarantee/security to be given by a company, that the validity of such a
guarantee/security interest could be challenged for lack of any interest by the guarantor in providing the
guarantee/security interest.

Further to this general legal restriction, additional limitations are imposed by specific laws, such as the prohibition
to exercise a financial activity without a specific authorization (which in the case of a Luxembourg company, does
not apply to financial activities within a group of companies) or the limitation on financial assistance to
shareholders in the case of subscription or purchase of shares of the guarantor.

2. Limitations imposed by the articles of association.

The provision of security interests by a company must be within the limits of the object clause of its articles of
association.

Should the provision of security by a Luxembourg company be considered to exceed the corporate objective as
expressed in the articles of association, the Issuer is still bound by such action, unless there is evidence that the
beneficiary of such acts knew that the acts exceeded the corporate objective or that the beneficiary could not, in
light of the circumstances, have been unaware of that fact.

_Corporate authority_

When a Luxembourg company grants security interests, applicable corporate procedures typically entail that the
decision be approved by a board resolution or by decision of delegates that have been appointed for such purpose.

_Corporate benefit_

The third condition for a security interest to be granted by a Luxembourg company is that the proposed action by
the Issuer must be “in the corporate interest of the Issuer”, which is a translation of the French intérêt _social, an_
equivalent term to the English legal concept of corporate benefit. The concept of “corporate interest” is not defined
by law, but has been developed by doctrine and court precedents and may be described as being “the limit of
acceptable corporate behavior”. Whereas the previous discussions regarding the limits of corporate power are
based on objective criteria (provisions of law and of the articles of association), the concept of corporate benefit
requires subjective judgment. In that context, the concept of a group of companies may be relevant, and while it
should first be analyzed whether a transaction is in the best interest of the Issuer on a standalone basis, it should
also be examined whether the transaction is justified in the light of the interest at the level of the group, which
may result in a benefit for the guarantor.


-----

In general terms, group interest may justify the issue of granting of security in favor of a parent company (upstream
guarantee) or a sister company (cross stream guarantee), under the following circumstances:

- the proposed action must be justified on the basis of a common economic, social, or financial policy applicable
throughout the whole group;

- the existence of a group should be evidenced through capital links; or

- the proposed action must (i) not be without any consideration, or alternatively (ii) not break up the balance
between the undertakings of the various group companies.

To the extent that all companies of the group are asked to bear the burden of security given for the benefit of the
other group company or companies in an equal way, the obligation undertaken by a group company for the benefit
of other group companies may be justified. Similarly, if a group company cannot exist outside of the group and is
dependent on the group, assistance to other group companies should ultimately result in a benefit for such
company. The limit of reasonable corporate behavior is reached when the transaction is exclusively in the interest
of the parent company or the other companies of the group, without any benefit, direct or indirect, for the
Luxembourg company granting the security.

However, the failure to comply with the corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability for the
directors or managers of the guarantor concerned. There is a limited risk that the directors or managers of the
Luxembourg company be held liable if, inter alia:

- the security interest provided would materially exceed the (direct or indirect) benefit derived from the secured
obligations for the Luxembourg company;

- the Luxembourg company derives no personal benefit or obtains no direct or indirect consideration for the
security interest granted; or

- the commitment of the Luxembourg company exceeds its financial means.

In addition to any criminal and civil liability incurred by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company,
the security interest could itself be held unenforceable, if it is held that it is contrary to public policy (ordre public).

The above analysis is slightly different within a group of companies where a group interest (intérêt du groupe)
exists. The existence of a group interest would prevent the security interest from falling foul of the above
constraints. In order for a group interest to be recognized, the following cumulative criteria must be met and
proven:

- the “assisting” company must receive some benefit, or there must be a balance between the respective
commitments of all the affiliates;

- the guarantee must not exceed the assisting company’s financial means;

- the companies involved must form part of a genuine group operating under a common strategy aimed at a
common objective; and

- the assistance must be granted for purposes of promoting a common economic, social and financial interest
determined in accordance with policies applicable to the entire group.

The criteria mentioned above is applied on a case-by-case basis and a subjective fact-based judgment is required
to be made by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg guarantor. As a result, the guarantees (upstream and
cross stream) granted by a Luxembourg company are subject to certain limitations, which usually take the form
of general limitation language, which is inserted in the relevant transaction document(s) and which covers the
aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg assisting company under the transaction
documents.

The Indenture contains the following limitation language:


-----

The guarantee granted by any guarantor which is incorporated and/or having its registered office and its place of
central administration in Luxembourg (a “Luxembourg Guarantor”) for the obligations of the Issuer which is
not a direct or indirect subsidiary of such Luxembourg Guarantor shall be limited at any time to an aggregate
amount not exceeding:

(i) the aggregate amount of the outstanding intercompany loans made to the Luxembourg Guarantor or
subsidiaries of that Luxembourg Guarantor (which are subsidiaries of that Luxembourg Guarantor on the
issue date or which will be subsidiaries of that Luxembourg Guarantor hereafter) by the Issuer, which
have been funded directly or indirectly with proceeds deriving from the sale of the Notes, increased by

(ii) the greater of:

(a) 90% of the sum of the Luxembourg Guarantor’s own funds (capitaux propres) and subordinated
debt (dettes subordonnées, including for the avoidance of doubt intragroup liabilities), both as
referred to in Annex I of the Luxembourg Grand-Ducal Regulation of December 18, 2015 in
relation to, _inter alia, Article 34 of the Luxembourg law of December 19, 2002 on the_
commercial register and annual accounts, as amended (the “2002 Law”) or, as applicable, as
referred to in the Grand-Ducal Regulation of September 12, 2019 (Règlement Grand-Ducal du
_12 septembre 2019 déterminant le contenu du plan comptable normalisé visé à l’article 12 du_
_Code de commerce), as of the issue date (whether as original party or by way of accession);_

(b) 90% of the sum of the Luxembourg Guarantor’s own funds (capitaux propres) and subordinated
debt (dettes subordonnées, including for the avoidance of doubt intragroup liabilities), both as
referred to in Annex I of the Luxembourg Grand-Ducal Regulation of December 18, 2015 in
relation to, inter alia, Article 34 of the 2002 Law, or, as applicable, as referred to in the GrandDucal Regulation of September 12, 2019 (Règlement Grand-Ducal du 12 septembre 2019
_déterminant le contenu du plan comptable normalisé visé à l’article 12 du Code de commerce),_
as at the date on which a demand is made under the Notes;

(c) 90% of the net assets of the Luxembourg Guarantor calculated on the basis of the fair market
value of the assets minus liabilities of the Luxembourg Guarantor (as determined by the agent
or if the agent so decides by a Luxembourg statutory approved auditor (réviseur d’entreprise
_agréé) (an “Independent Auditor”) as of the issue date (whether as original party or by way_
of accession); or

(d) 90% of the net assets of the Luxembourg Guarantor calculated on the basis of the fair market
value of the assets minus liabilities of the Luxembourg Guarantor (as determined by the Trustee
or if the Trustee so decides by an Independent Auditor as of the date on which a demand is made
under the Notes).

**_Security Interests Considerations_**

According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply lex rei sitae or lex
_situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is situated) in relation_
to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg
law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or
deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held
with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in
Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in
Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc. If there are assets located or deemed to be
located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be
created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law.

The Collateral Act 2005 governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares, bank
accounts and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Under the Collateral Act 2005, the
perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A share
pledge agreement over present and future shares must be registered in the shareholders’ register of such company.
A receivables pledge becomes enforceable against the debtor and against third parties by the mere entering into
the pledge agreement by the pledgor and the pledgee. However, the debtor is validly discharged from its payment
obligations by payment to the pledgor as long as it has not gained knowledge of the pledge.


-----

Article 11 of the Collateral Act 2005 sets out the following enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence
of an enforcement event:

- appropriate or cause a third party to appropriate this collateral at a price determined, before or after
appropriation, by the valuation method agreed by the parties;

- assign or cause to be assigned the pledged collateral by private sale in a commercially reasonable manner, by
sale over a stock exchange or by public auction;

- court adjudication of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a
valuation made by a court appointed expert; or

- set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Collateral Act 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen,
(ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses and (iv) the possible need to involve third
parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be
substantially delayed.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any third party
creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created
under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Except as provided in Article 20(4)
of the Collateral Act 2005, a third party creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledger, which are
subject to such security through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries under the relevant pledge or security
documents will remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale.

Under Luxembourg law, security interests qualifying as financial collateral arrangements under the Collateral Act
2005 may be granted in favor of a person acting on behalf of the beneficiaries of such security interests, a fiduciary
or a trustee as a security for the claims of third party beneficiaries, present or future, to the extent that such third
party beneficiaries are or may be determined.

**_Registration in Luxembourg_**

Under the Luxembourg law, it is not necessary that any of the transaction documents be filed, recorded or enrolled
with any court or other authority or that any stamp, registration, notarial or similar taxes or fees be paid on or in
relation to, or the transactions contemplated by, any of the transaction documents except:

- for any fees payable in respect of registrations required in respect of any transaction documents (where
applicable); and

- in cases where the transaction documents are either (a) attached as an annex to an act (annexés à un acte) that
itself is subject to mandatory registration or (b) deposited in the minutes of a notary (déposés au rang des
_minutes d’un notaire). In such cases, as well as in case of a voluntary registration, the transaction documents_
will be subject to registration duties payable by the party registering, or being ordered to register, the
transaction documents.

Depending on the nature of the transaction documents, such registration duties would be ad valorem or fixed.

**_Insolvency_**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, and as such any insolvency
proceedings applicable to such companies is in principle governed by Luxembourg law. The insolvency laws of
Luxembourg may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other
jurisdictions with which you may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Luxembourg. In the event that a
Luxembourg company experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which
jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings.


-----

Pursuant to Luxembourg insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment under the Notes may be more limited
than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings
(collectively referred to as “insolvency proceedings”) may be opened against a company incorporated in
Luxembourg having its center of main interests in Luxembourg or an establishment within the meaning of the
Insolvency Regulation (in relation to secondary proceedings):

- bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the Issuer or by any of its
creditors. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the
Issuer: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial
creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may open
bankruptcy proceedings on its own motion. The main effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all
measures of enforcement against the Issuer, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by
secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of
the assets;

- controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested by the
Issuer and not by its creditors and under which a court may order a provisional suspension of payments,
including a stay of enforcement of claims by secured creditors; or

- composition proceedings (concordat préventif de faillite), the opening of which may only be requested by the
Issuer (subject to obtaining the consent of the majority of its creditors) and not by its creditors themselves.
The court’s decision to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on
enforcement of claims by creditors.

In addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of a
court to grant a reprieve from payments (sursis de paiement) or to put a Luxembourg company into judicial
liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public
prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity that violates criminal laws or that are in serious breach or
violation of the commercial code or of the Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as
amended. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow rules similar to those applicable
to bankruptcy proceedings. Liability of a Luxembourg company in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a
liquidation of the Issuer following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of
liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those debts of the relevant entity
that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among
others:

- certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

- VAT and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise;

- social security contributions; and

- remuneration owed to employees.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to
unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized).

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. The ability
of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited, in particular in the event of
controlled management proceedings providing expressly that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final
decision has been taken by the court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter
by a reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50%
of the creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant Luxembourg company’s liabilities in order to take
effect. Furthermore, declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence
of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings.

Luxembourg insolvency law may affect transactions entered into or payments made by a Luxembourg company
during the period before the opening of the insolvency proceedings. If the liquidator or administrator (including,
without limitation, in relation to a Luxembourg company, any _commissaire,_ _juge-commissaire, liquidateur or_
_curateur or similar official) can show that the Luxembourg company has given “preference” to any person by_


-----

defrauding the rights of creditors generally, regardless of when this fraud occurred, a Luxembourg court has the
power to void the “abnormal” transaction. If the liquidator or administrator can show that: (i) a payment in relation
to a due debt was made during the hardening period (période suspecte, which is a maximum of six months and
ten days preceding the judgment declaring the opening of the insolvency proceedings) that is disadvantageous to
the general body of creditors; and/or (ii) the party receiving such payment is shown to have known that the
bankrupt party had ceased to make payments when such payment occurred, a Luxembourg court has the power,
among other things, to void the preferential transaction.

In particular:

- pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (code de commerce), specified transactions
(such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent payment of debts which have not
fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means;
the payment of debts that have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by a bill of exchange; the sale
of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect
period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the
insolvency receiver;

- pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as
other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to cancellation by the
court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of
the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments;

- pursuant to Article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and Article 1167 of the Civil Code (action
_paulienne) the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent_
payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the
bankruptcy, without any time limit; and

- pursuant to Article 21(2) of the Collateral Act 2005, a financial collateral arrangement entered into after the
opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force
of such measures is valid and binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers or liquidators
notwithstanding the suspect period referred to in Articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce,
if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that
such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of
contracts except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the Issuer or its solvency
were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the insolvency receiver may
choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the Issuer. As of the date
of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. The
bankruptcy order provides for a period of time during which creditors must file their claims with the clerk’s office
of the Luxembourg district court sitting in commercial matters. After having converted all available assets of the
Issuer into cash and after having determined all the Issuer’s liabilities, the insolvency receiver will distribute the
proceeds of the sale, on a pro rata basis, to the creditors after deduction of the receiver fees and the bankruptcy
administration costs. Insolvency proceedings may therefore have a material adverse effect on a Luxembourg
company’s business and assets and the Luxembourg company’s respective obligations under the notes.

The bankruptcy receiver decides whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts
existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor,
provided the bankruptcy receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any
prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply:

- the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early
termination or acceleration event; and

- _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential_
element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since
the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the Issuer. Parties can agree to continue to perform
under such contracts.


-----

The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party that are still to be
performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the
bankruptcy. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim
will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant
contract dissolved. The counterparty may not require specific performance of the contract.

International aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or voluntary arrangement with creditors’
proceedings may be subject to the Insolvency Regulation.

Pursuant to the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in
relation to a company is the court of the EU Member State (other than Denmark) where the Issuer concerned has
its “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation). The determination
of where any such company has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different
EU Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Although there is a
rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation that any such company has its center of
main interests in the EU Member State in which it has its registered office, Preamble 30 of the Insolvency
Regulation states that the “center of main interests” of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor
conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third parties”. In
that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where a company conducts the majority
of its business and the location where the majority of a company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in
the determination of the place where a company has its center of main interests. The time when a company’s
center of main interests is determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened.

If the center of main interests of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered
office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the Issuer under the Insolvency Regulation would be opened
in such jurisdiction, and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to open the types of insolvency
proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one EU
Member State under the Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than
Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another EU Member State. If the center of main
interests of a debtor is in one EU Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another EU Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary
proceedings” only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” (in the meaning of the Insolvency
Regulation) in the territory of such other EU Member State. The effects of those secondary proceedings are
restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other EU Member State. If a company does
not have an establishment in any other EU Member State, no court of any other EU Member State has jurisdiction
to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the Insolvency Regulation.

To the extent that our center of main interests is deemed to be outside Luxembourg, courts of such other
jurisdictions may have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of such company.

**Portugal**

The conditions to be satisfied by the granting of guarantees/security interests relate to (i) capacity and (ii) corporate
authority. These rules are derived from general principles and must be applied to specific circumstances, which
have to be analyzed on a case by case basis.

**_Capacity_**

Limits on capacity can either be imposed (i) by law or (ii) by the articles of association of the company.

1. Limitations imposed by law.

Pursuant to the Portuguese Companies Code (Código das Sociedades Comerciais) (the “Companies Code”), a
company incorporated in Portugal (a “Portuguese Company”) has the capacity to enter into any agreements,
including financing and security agreements as long as they are necessary or convenient to pursue its purposes.
Therefore, a purely free (or gratuitous) act, without consideration, may be outside the scope of the activities of a
company as contemplated by law. A company may however carry out gratuitous acts whenever these acts are
deemed usual in accordance with the circumstances of time and the own means of the company.


-----

The Companies Code sets outs some restrictions on capacity of Portuguese Companies, in particular in what
concerns the granting of security interest and guarantees to secure and guarantee the obligations of third parties.
Pursuant to article 6(3) of the Companies Code, companies may guarantee third parties’ obligations provided that:

        - The third party is in a controlling or a group relationship (relação de domínio ou de grupo) as
defined in the Companies Code; or

        - The company has a justified own interest (justificado interesse próprio) in guaranteeing the
obligations of such company.

Under the Companies Code the definition of “controlling relationship” includes relationships between Portuguese
companies where one holds, directly or indirectly the majority of the share capital or the voting rights in, or the
right to appoint the majority of the members of the board of directors or supervisory board of another company
on, the other company. A “group relationship” includes relationships between Portuguese companies where one
is 100% owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the other or between companies that are bound by a group
agreement or a subordination agreement whereby one company is subject to the instructions or management of
the other.

In the absence of a controlling or a group relationship, the validity of a guarantee/security interest could be
challenged if there is no justified own interest (justificado interesse próprio).

Further to this general legal restriction, additional limitations are imposed by specific laws, such as the prohibition
to exercise a financial activity without a specific authorization or the limitation on financial assistance to
shareholders or third parties, under the article 322 of the Companies Code, whereby the guarantee or security
interest provided by a Portuguese company cannot be extended to cover any indebtedness used to fund, directly
or indirectly, the acquisition or subscription of the share capital of such Portuguese company or its parent company
(or, if applicable, in any other company which may indirectly control the Portuguese company).

2. Limitations imposed by the articles of association.

The provision of guarantees or security interest by a company must be within the limits of the corporate purpose
clause of its articles of association.

Should the provision of a guarantee or security by a Portuguese company be considered to exceed the corporate
purpose as expressed in the articles of association, the company is still bound by such action, unless there is
evidence that the beneficiary of such acts knew that the acts exceeded the corporate purpose or that the beneficiary
could not, in light of the circumstances, have been unaware of that fact.

**_Corporate Authority_**

When a Portuguese Company grants guarantees/security interests, applicable corporate procedures normally entail
that the decision be approved by a board resolution and/or by a shareholders meeting resolution and, where
applicable, that the own interest (interesse próprio) of the Portuguese Company be justified in such resolution(s).

**_Public Policy_**

The guarantee/security interest or any of its provisions could be held unenforceable, if it is deemed to be contrary
to public policy (ordem pública).

**_Limitation Language_**

The granting of guarantee/security interest in breach of capacity and financial assistance rules could entail criminal
and civil liability incurred by the directors or managers of the Portuguese Company.

As a result, the guarantees and collateral (in particular, upstream and cross-stream) granted by a Portuguese
Company are subject to certain limitations, which usually take the form of a general limitation language, which is
inserted in the relevant transaction document(s) (which will be included in the indentures executed by the
Portuguese Companies), and which covers the maximum aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant
Portuguese Company under the transaction documents and excludes any obligations that may be deemed to


-----

constitute financial assistance pursuant to article 322 of the Portuguese Companies Code and/or a breach of the
restrictions on capacity set out in article 6(3) of the Companies Code.

**_Security Interest Considerations_**

_Governing law_

According to Portuguese conflict of law rules, the courts in Portugal will generally apply the lex rei sitae or lex
_situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is situated) in relation_
to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Portuguese
law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or
deemed to be located in Portugal, such as registered shares in Portuguese companies, bank accounts held with a
bank or branch (sucursal) in Portugal, receivables/claims governed by Portuguese law and/or having debtors
located in Portugal, movable assets located in Portugal, securities which are held through a securities account
located in Portugal, bearer securities physically located in Portugal, etc.

If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Portugal, the security interests over such assets will be
governed by Portuguese law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Portuguese law.

_Perfection_

Under Portuguese law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification and/or
acceptance requirements. As examples: (a) the pledge of nominative shares represented by share certificates must
be (i) endorsed in the shares certificates and (ii) registered in the shareholders’ register of such company; (b) the
receivables pledge becomes enforceable against the debtor after it has been notified to, or acknowledged by, the
debtor; (c) the bank account pledge becomes effective against the banks after having been notified to, or
acknowledged by, the banks; and (d) the mortgages over real estate must be registered with the Real Estate
Registry Office.

_Enforcement methods_

In the case of a share pledge, bank account pledge and receivable pledge or assignment as security, the
enforcement methods which are generally considered more suitable are (i) private sale (venda extraprocessual),
(ii) foreclosure (apropriação) in case of financial pledges and/or (iii) disposal of collateral assigned as security
(venda executiva). The private sale and foreclosure are only allowed if the security agreement so provides. The
foreclosure is permitted for financial pledges over securities and cash deposits and for commercial pledges
governed by Decree Law 75/2017 of June 26, 2017, provided that the parties agree the valuation method. In case
of non-financial pledges (other than pledges governed by Decree Law 75/2017 of June 26, 2017), the foreclosure
must be carried out at the price determined by a court of law. Court enforcement is also possible but is usually
considered to be lengthier and could prejudice the recovery of the claims.

_Rights of third parties_

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any third party
creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created
under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. A third party creditor may seek
the forced sale of the assets of the pledgor which are subject to such security through court proceedings, although
the beneficiaries under the relevant pledge or security documents will remain entitled to priority over the proceeds
of such sale. In this case, the beneficiaries under the relevant pledge or security documents have to timely claim
their credits (“reclamação de créditos”) within the scope of the court proceedings initiated by the third parties
creditors.

_Language_

Portuguese law documents may be executed in English. However, in case of enforcement the Portuguese courts
or any other official Portuguese authority may require that the transaction documents and any judgment obtained
in a foreign court be translated into Portuguese.


-----

**_Insolvency_**

The ability of the Noteholders to enforce, secure and realize their rights under guarantees or security interests
granted by a Portuguese Company may be delayed, restricted, subordinated, completely terminated or otherwise
adversely affected in any insolvency proceedings conducted under Portuguese jurisdiction or subject to
Portuguese law. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect rights of secured creditors generally
and in insolvency proceedings particularly:

        - _Voidability of prejudicial transactions. Under Decree Law 53/2004 of March 18, 2004, as last_
amended by Decree-Law 84/2019 of June 28, 2019 (the “Portuguese Insolvency Code”), any
transfer of assets, granting of guarantees or creation of security interests by a Portuguese
Company may be terminated by the insolvency administrator irrespective of any other
conditions in an insolvency proceeding of the Portuguese Company (the “Presumed
**Prejudicial Transactions”) if, inter alia, (i) the guarantee is granted in the six months prior to**
the initiation of the insolvency proceeding and is related with transactions which are not in the
best interest of the Portuguese Company, (ii) the security interest is given in respect of existing
obligations or new obligations replacing such existing obligations within six months prior to the
initiation of the insolvency proceedings, (iii) the security interest is granted simultaneously with
the creation of the secured obligations if they are undertaken in the 60 days prior to the initiation
of the insolvency proceedings or (iv) the agreements are executed against consideration during
the year before the insolvency petition is filed and the obligations of the Portuguese Company
are deemed excessive when compared with those of the counterparty.

        - _Voidability of other transactions. In addition to the Presumed Prejudicial Transactions described_
above, the insolvency administrator may also terminate any transactions entered upon by the
Portuguese Company during the two years prior to the initiation of the insolvency proceedings,
and are entered into in bad faith by the counterparty. Bad faith will be deemed to exist if the
beneficiaries knew, at the time the security or guarantee was given, that (i) the Portuguese
Company was insolvent, (ii) the granting of the security would be prejudicial and that the
insolvency was imminent and (iii) the insolvency proceedings had already been initiated. Bad
faith is presumed to exist in relation to any transaction entered upon with or benefiting a related
entity in the two years before the initiation of the insolvency proceedings irrespective of whether
such relation existed or not on the date the transaction was entered upon.

        - The issuance of an insolvency order by a court of competent authority in respect of a company
results in a stay of proceedings. The insolvency order creates a stay on all enforcement actions
pending against the debtor. After the issuance of the insolvency order, the administration and
disposal of assets will be decided by a court appointed administrator.

        - Claims and rights of creditors of a company in insolvency proceedings may abate in whole or
in part due to insufficient funds and assets of the company in insolvency. Under the Portuguese
Insolvency Code higher ranking creditors of a certain class will be permitted to satisfy their
interests prior to creditors of lower rankings, and creditors of the same class will have a pro rata
right to secure and satisfy their interest with other creditors of the same class. Creditors holding
a pledge or charge in relation to the insolvent’s assets rank higher in priority to shareholders
and other unsecured creditors of a company. Such creditors are entitled to receive the proceeds
from the disposal of the pledged asset to satisfy their claim but will be treated as unsecured
creditors with respect to any portion thereof not entirely satisfied by the proceeds received from
the disposal of the pledge if such proceeds are insufficient to repay their entire claim. Creditors
holding a pledge or charge may, however, be only be paid after (i) the debts of the insolvent
company incurred during the insolvency proceedings, the court fees and other costs concerning
the proceeding, subject to certain requirements and limits, (ii) the debts of creditors statutorily
preferred under Portuguese law (e.g. tax authorities holding a lien in respect of taxes owed and
not paid on real estate property of the company) and (iii) the debts of certain creditors holding
statutory liens (e.g. employees).


-----

**Dominican Republic**

Conditions to be satisfied for the granting of guarantees in the Dominican Republic are derived from general
principles of law and must be applied to each specific case. Generally, these conditions relate to (i) capacity and
(ii) corporate authority.

**_Capacity_**

A company incorporated in the Dominican Republic (a “Dominican Company”) has the capacity to enter into
agreements necessary or convenient according to the corporate purpose established under its bylaws, including
financing and guarantee agreements.

The goal to create value and therefore profits for its shareholders is an essential element of every company and
therefore, an act without receiving consideration may fall outside the scope of the purpose of a Dominican
Company and could be challenged for lack of interest/cause. However, a Dominican Company may grant a
guarantee in favor of a parent/controlling entity or in favor of subsidiaries or other related entities belonging to
the same corporate group.

The granting of a guarantee by a Dominican Company must be for its corporate benefit (interés social). There is
no statutory definition of corporate benefit under Dominican law; understanding that the existence or absence of
corporate benefit is assessed by the courts on a case by case basis.

A guarantee could be held unenforceable if it is contrary to public policy.

**_Corporate Authority_**

When a Dominican Company grants guarantees, applicable corporate procedures normally entail that the decision
be approved by a board resolution or by decision of shareholders in a general shareholders meeting, in each case
according to applicable rules of quorum and majority set forth by the bylaws/law.

According to Article 217 of General Corporations Law No. 479-08 (as amended), issuance of corporate guarantee
by a Dominican Company shall be approved by the Board of Directors, unless the bylaws require approval by the
general shareholders meeting. On the other hand, pursuant to Article 327 of the said law, a Dominican Company
shall not grant as security obligations issued by such company.

Under General Corporations Law No. 479-08 (amended) the following transactions require authorization by the
Board of Directors: (i) transactions with one or more of the members of the Board of Managers of a Dominican
Company; (ii) transactions with third parties where one or more of the members of the Board of Managers of a
Dominican Company have an interest in any manner; (iii) transactions with other entities where one or more of
the members of the Board of Managers owns shares or is also member of the board of managers of such other
entity. In addition, under General Corporations Law No. 479-08 (as amended), approval by the shareholders
meeting shall be required in addition to board approval when any of the previously mentioned transactions involve
an amount equal to or greater than 15% of the equity of a Dominican Company, individually or in the aggregate
(on a 12-months basis).

**_Grace Period_**

Under Article 1244 of the Dominican Civil Code, a Dominican court may under certain conditions grant a grace
period in favor of debtor. When a debt is secured by a mortgage over real estate assets, grace period shall not
exceed six months. During the grace period collection actions are suspended including any pending enforcement
measures that may have been initiated by creditors. A debtor cannot waive in advance its right to ask the court for
a grace period.

**_Security Interest Considerations_**

_Governing law_

The courts in the Dominican Republic will generally apply the law of the place where the assets or subject matter
of the pledge or security interest is located in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security


-----

interests over such asset. As a consequence, Dominican law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and
enforcement of security interests over assets located in the Dominican Republic.

_Perfection/Lien_

Under Dominican law, the perfection of security interests and creation of liens depend on certain registration,
notification and/or acceptance requirements applicable according to the type of security being perfected. On
February 18, 2020, Law No. 45-20 on Movable Collateral (“Law 45-20”) was enacted with the purpose of
establishing a legal framework that encourages the use of movable collateral. This new law, among other things,
creates a public electronic registration system, the Electronic System of Movable Collateral (“SEGM”, for its
acronym in Spanish), and a unitary regime applicable to the incorporation, effectiveness, publicity, registration,
priority, execution and other matters related to security interests over movable assets in the Dominican Republic.

In the legal system of the Dominican Republic, movable collateral refers to all preferential rights that constitute
movable assets, such as a pledge, universal pledge, assignment of rights by way of security, chattel pledge with
or without dispossession or any other asset included under the unitary concept of movable collateral.

The SEGM is an electronic file with remote access where movable collateral are published in accordance with
Law 45-20, and its implementation is governed by regulations issued by the Executive Branch at the request of
the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and MiPymes (micro, small and medium enterprises), along with
complementary regulations of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and other internal provisions issued for its
operation.

The regulation on implementation of the SEGM has yet to be enacted and the system yet to be implemented. As
Law 45-20 entered into force on December 2020, all its dispositions, including those related to the repeal of all
existing legal dispositions on the perfection and creation of pledges over shares, chattel pledges, assignment of
rights by way of security, among others, have entered into force. Currently, there is lack of clarity with respect to
the manner in which security interest in movable collateral should be perfected as without the creation and
implementation of the SEGM, the perfection of movable collateral cannot be completed.

As of the date hereof, there is a bill in the Dominican Congress (already approved by the House of Representatives),
which seeks to postpone the entry into force of Law 45-20 until the year 2023. If the entry into force of Law 4520 is postponed until 2023, movable collateral may be registered/perfected in the manner established by
Dominican regulation existing prior to the entry into force of Law 45-20.

_Enforcement methods_

In general, foreclosure requires judicial foreclosure procedures to be carried out before Dominican courts.
Procedures vary depending on the type of asset/security being foreclosed on. There are certain requirements
providing for notification to debtor, publicity and court hearings. Procedures normally end with a sale of the
underlying asset at a public auction. However, in some cases (such as foreclosure on a pledge) creditor can either
ask the court to sell the pledged assets at a public auction or request the court that the said assets be transferred to
the creditor in payment of the secured debt. Contractual provisions allowing a creditor obtain ownership of the
underlying asset without following judicial foreclosure procedures are generally considered null.

_Rights of third parties_

The existence of security interests created pursuant to pledge/security agreements does not prevent third party
creditors from seeking attachment or execution of assets already subject to a security interest created in favor of
another creditor. A third party creditor may seek the forced sale of the said assets through court proceedings,
although the secured creditor can oppose and should be entitled to priority over the proceeds of the sale.

_Language_

Documents creating security may be executed in English or another language. However, for registration and
enforcement purposes or any other official use, a translation into Spanish prepared by an Official Translator duly
authorized in the Dominican Republic is required.


-----

**_Insolvency—Statutory Priorities_**

The ability of creditors to enforce security and collect under guarantees granted by a Dominican Company may
be delayed, terminated or otherwise adversely affected by (i) insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings under
Dominican law or (ii) statutory priorities adversely affecting rights of secured creditors generally.

**_Insolvency—Bankruptcy_**

In the Dominican Republic, insolvency proceedings of commercial entities are governed by Law No. 141-15 of
Restructuring and Liquidation of Businesses and Physical Persons on the Dominican Republic (the “Law 141**15”) which was enacted on August 7, 2015 by the Executive Branch and entered into force on February 7, 2017.**

Until the promulgation and entry into force of Law 141-15, the Dominican legal system did not contemplate the
restructuring of companies and individuals traders, but used such figures as bankruptcy and liquidation.

Law 141-15 has introduced new figures of its own in order to enable the effective application of its provisions
and orders the establishment of specialized courts to hear judicial proceedings.

Law 141-15 regulates the process applicable to: (i) the natural persons traders, be they national or foreign; and (ii)
national companies and those that have established domicile or have a permanent presence in the country.

Its purpose is mainly to: (i) protect creditors against the insolvency of their debtors; and (ii) help debtors overcome
their insolvency situation, ensuring their operational continuity.

One of the pillars of Law 141-15 is the creation of the restructuring and liquidation jurisdiction, composed of the
Restructuring and Liquidation Courts of First Instance and the Appeals Courts of Restructuring and Liquidation.

The decisions of the latter may be appealed in cassation before the Civil and Commercial Chamber of the Supreme
Court of Justice. Law 141-15 also creates two special courts located in Santiago and in the National District, which
will be territorially competent to cover the other jurisdictions of the country.

The restructuring can be requested from the competent Court of Restructuring and Liquidation (the “Court”),
both by the debtor and/or by one of the creditors to whom Law 141-15 grants quality for this. Once the request
for restructuring has been made, the Court should order the appointment of a verifier to confirm the debtor’s
financial situation and to inform the Court of the results of its investigations. Once a restructuring application is
submitted by the debtor, or when it is notified to the latter if it emanates from the creditor, the debtor is subject to
an obligation to inform the court and the verifier of any act of administration or provision aimed at changing the
bylaws, implementation of mergers, constitution of guarantees, payments, transactions, conciliations, execution
of agreements with creditors, or disposal of assets or rights.

The rule allows the parties to submit a Preliminary Agreement of Restructuring Plan, which if accepted by the
Court, will have the same effect as the restructuring ordered by said Court.

If the Court welcomes the restructuring process, it orders the notification and initiates the Conciliation and
Negotiation process, which will be guided by a Personal Conciliator appointed by the same Court. During this
process all judicial, administrative or arbitral actions against the estate are suspended, as well as any executive,
eviction or seizure of movable and immovable property of the debtor, the calculation of interests, enforcement
procedures of tax credits and other payments, so that the debtor can continue with the operation of the business.

Precisely for the purposes of business continuity during the conciliation process, it is envisaged that, at the request
of the conciliator and without an objection from the majority of creditors, the Court may authorize new financing
at the expense of the debtor to ensure continuity of ordinary operations.

At the request of the creditors duly substantiated, the Personal Conciliator may bring an action for annulment
against acts performed by the Debtor within two years prior to the date of the request for restructuring, when those
acts have constituted an unjustified distraction of the property of the estate.


-----

**_Statutory priorities_**

Certain types of credits are granted priority in collection by Dominican law and are therefore considered privileged
credits (créditos privilegiados). Privileged credits shall have preference in collecting from debtors assets even in
the presence of secured creditors possessing liens on debtor’s assets. Creditors with statutory priority include,
among others; (i) employees (for collection of salaries, wages and labor compensation), (ii) Dominican tax
authorities (for collection of tax obligations), (iii) lawyers (for collection of legal fees) and (iv) landlords (for
collection of rent).


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) by and among,
_inter alios the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer has agreed to sell to each Initial Purchaser, and each_
Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, together with all other Initial
Purchasers, the Dollar Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1,925 million and the Euro Notes in an
aggregate principal amount of €700 million.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the respective issue price indicated on the
cover page hereof. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and any other
selling terms without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates.
Sales in the United States will be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers which are registered with the
SEC as U.S. registered broker dealers.

In the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed that:

        - subject to certain exceptions, neither the Issuer, Altice International nor any of the other
Guarantors will offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any of their debt securities,
or guarantee such debt securities (other than the Notes, the Guarantees and any intercompany
debt), without the prior written consent of the Representatives (as defined therein), for a period
of 30 days after the date of the final Offering Memorandum; and

        - the Issuer will indemnify the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the
Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

Each purchaser of Notes offered by this Offering Memorandum, in making its purchase, will be deemed to have
made the acknowledgements, representations and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors”.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act and may not
be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except to qualified
institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and to certain persons in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of this offering and (ii) the issue date of the
Notes, an offer or sale within the United States of Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S by a dealer
(whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements for the U.S. Securities Act
if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A. Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. is not a U.S.
registered broker-dealer,and will not effect any offers or sales of any notes in the United States unless it is through
one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers as permitted by the regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, Inc. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. For a description
of certain further restrictions on resale or transfer of the Notes, see “Notice to Investors”.

The Notes may not be offered to the public within any jurisdiction. By accepting delivery of this Offering
Memorandum, you agree not to offer, sell, resell, transfer or deliver, directly or indirectly, any Note to the public.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser represents warrants and agrees that it:

        - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to
be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any
Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to such Initial
Purchaser or the Guarantors; and

        - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the U.K.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the U.K., by us or the Initial
Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this


-----

Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this
purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this
Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be
distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules
and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to
sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful.
Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to
observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and
resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors”.

The Initial Purchasers and the Guarantors have also agreed that we will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale,
pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act
or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

(a) at any time, to national and regional governments, central banks, international and supranational
institutions (such as the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, the European
Investment Bank) and other similar international organizations to the extent that they are considered as
qualified investors in accordance with the Luxembourg Prospectus Act implementing the EU Prospectus
Regulation;

(b) at any time, to legal entities which are authorized or regulated to operate in the financial markets
(including credit institutions, investment firms, other authorized or regulated financial institutions,

and their management companies, insurance undertakings and commodity dealers) as well as entities not

the EU Prospectus Regulation; and

(c) at any time, to certain natural persons or small and medium-sized enterprises considered as qualified
investors in accordance with the Luxembourg Prospectus Act implementing the EU Prospectus
Regulation.

**Israel**

Sales of the Notes in Israel will be made through the Initial Purchasers and/or through an Israeli broker(s) engaged
by them. The Notes will not be offered to an Israeli person unless such offeree is a “qualified investor” (as defined
in the First Appendix to the Israeli Securities Law) who is not an individual (a “Qualified Israeli Investor”) and
who (x) completed and signed a questionnaire regarding its qualifications as a Qualified Israel Investor and (y)
certified that it has an exemption from Israeli withholding taxes on interest and delivered a copy of such
certification to the relevant Initial Purchaser.

**General**

The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently is no established trading market. In addition, the
Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Notice to Investors” and “Notice
_to Certain European Investors”. The Issuer will apply for the Notes to be admitted to listing on the Exchange,_


-----

however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure—The Notes may not become, or remain, listed
_on the Exchange”._

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable
law, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Notes
at any time in their sole discretion without notice. In addition, such market-making activities will be subject to the
limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid
trading market will develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the
prices that you receive when you sell which will be favorable.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other
charges in connection with purchases of securities.

In connection with the offering, each Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, each Stabilizing
Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price
of the Notes. Each Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over allot the offering of the
Notes, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the
syndicate short position. In addition, each Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and
purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty
bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that
may otherwise prevail. Each Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these
activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the
Notes.

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty
bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of
the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit
bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.
Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed
to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker
or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering
transaction to cover short positions.

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher
than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be
discontinued at any time.

The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may enter
into in the future investment banking, financial advisory and/or lending and commercial banking transactions with,
and/or may perform other services for, to us and/or our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they
have received or may receive customary fees, commissions and reimbursement of expenses (including acting as
initial purchasers, arrangers and/or lenders in connection with previous issuances of debt securities and debt
facilities of the Issuer or its affiliates). In connection with our strategy to review and evaluate selective acquisitions
and other business combinations, we and our shareholders regularly engage mergers and acquisition advisors and
other financial advisors to assist us. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may be currently advising
us or other interested parties, and the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may advise us or other interested parties
from time to time on other transactions in the future. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates
are party to certain of our hedging arrangements and other financing and/or debt arrangements and may hold other
proprietary positions in us, our current or future subsidiaries and their affiliates and/or financial intermediaries
and the financial instruments issued by any of them.

Depending on market conditions, the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of the
Notes for their own account.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date on the cover
page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be seven business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule
15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle being referred
to as “T+7”). Trades in the secondary market generally settle in two business days unless the parties to any such


-----

trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering
Memorandum or the next five succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle
at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades
should consult their own advisors.

Altice International, its parent companies or their controlling shareholder or any of their respective affiliates may
purchase Notes in the offering at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of
this Offering Memorandum. The purchase agreement between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers will not restrict
the ability of Altice International, its parent companies or their controlling shareholder or any of their respective
affiliates to buy or sell Notes in the future and, as a result, Altice International, its parent or their controlling
shareholder or any of their respective affiliates may buy or sell the Notes in open market transactions at any time
following the consummation of the offering of the Notes.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (and/or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts
of their customers, and such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the
Issuer or its affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or
instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in
such securities and instruments. Affiliates of certain Initial Purchasers are agents and/or lenders under the Altice
Financing Term Loans and the Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facilities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or
their respective affiliates may also beneficially own the Altice Financing 2026 Notes and may therefore receive a
portion of the proceeds of the Notes pursuant to the Refinancing Transactions.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a public limited liability company (société anonyme), incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg
and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Israel, Luxembourg, Portugal and the Dominican Republic.

Many of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States
and a substantial portion of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a consequence,
you may not be able to effect service of process on these non-U.S. resident directors and officers in the United
States or to enforce judgments against them outside of the United States, including judgments of the U.S. courts
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws.

**Israel**

The Issuer has been advised by its Israeli counsel that, subject to specified time limitations and legal procedures,
Israeli courts may enforce a foreign judgment in a civil matter which is non-appealable, provided that among other
things:

        - the judgment is obtained after due process before a court of competent jurisdiction, according
to the laws of the foreign state in which the judgment is given and the rules of private
international law currently prevailing in Israel;

        - the prevailing law of the foreign state in which the judgment is rendered allows for the
enforcement of judgments of Israeli courts;

        - adequate service of process has been effected and the defendant has had a reasonable
opportunity to be heard and to present his or her evidence;

        - the judgment is not contrary to public policy of Israel, and the enforcement of the civil liabilities
set forth in the judgment is not likely to impair the security or sovereignty of Israel;

        - the judgment was not obtained by fraud and does not conflict with any other valid judgment in
the same matter between the same parties;

        - an action between the same parties in the same matter was not pending in any Israeli court at
the time at which the lawsuit was instituted in the foreign court; and

        - the judgment is enforceable according to the laws of Israel and according to the law of the
foreign state in which the relief was granted.

If a foreign judgment is enforced by an Israeli court, it generally will be payable in Israeli currency, which can
then be converted into non-Israeli currency and transferred out of Israel. The usual practice in an action before an
Israeli court to recover an amount in a non-Israeli currency is for the Israeli court to issue a judgment for the
equivalent amount in Israeli currency at the rate of exchange in force on the date of the judgment, but the judgment
debtor may make payment in foreign currency. Pending collection, the amount of the judgment of an Israeli court
stated in Israeli currency ordinarily will be linked to the Israeli consumer price index plus a per annum statutory
rate of interest set on a quarterly basis by Israeli regulations. Judgment creditors must bear the risk of unfavorable
exchange rates. In recent years, Israeli courts have increasingly been willing to enforce a foreign judgment in the
foreign currency specified in the judgment, in which case there are also applicable rules regarding the payment of
interest.

**Luxembourg**

As there is no treaty in force on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial
matters between the United States and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, courts in Luxembourg will not
automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. A valid judgment against the Issuer
or a Guarantor incorporated in Luxembourg with respect to the Notes obtained from a court of competent
jurisdiction in the United States, which judgment remains in full force and effect after all appeals as may be taken
in the relevant state or federal jurisdiction with respect thereto have been taken, may be entered and enforced
through a court of competent jurisdiction of Luxembourg, subject to compliance with the enforcement procedures


-----

(exequatur) set forth in Article 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau Code de
_Procédure Civile), being:_

- the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by the Luxembourg conflict of laws rules;

- the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

- the U.S. court order or judgment must not result from an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi);

- the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the particular matter under its applicable
laws, and such jurisdiction is recognized by Luxembourg private international and local law;

- the judgment is enforceable in the jurisdiction where the decision has been rendered;

- the judgment was obtained in compliance with the rights of the defendant, i.e., following proceedings at which
the defendant had the opportunity to appear, was granted the necessary time to prepare its case and, if it
appeared, could present a defense; and

- the considerations of the foreign order as well as the judgment do not contravene international public policy
as understood under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg or have been given in proceedings of a
criminal or tax nature.

We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in Luxembourg,
Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law if the choice of such foreign law was not made bona
fide or if (i) the foreign law was not pleaded and proved or (ii) if pleaded and proved, such foreign law was
contrary to mandatory Luxembourg laws or incompatible with Luxembourg public policy rules. In an action
brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the
requisite power to grant the remedies sought.

**Portugal**

The Issuer has been advised by its Portuguese counsel, that a valid, final and conclusive judgment against a
guarantor of Portuguese nationality with respect to its Guarantee obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction
in the United States, which judgment remains in full force and effect after all appeals as may be taken in the
relevant state or federal jurisdiction with respect thereto have been taken, may be entered and enforced through a
court of competent jurisdiction of Portugal subject to compliance with the judgments enforcement requirements
including, without limitation, those set out in Article 980 et seq. of the Portuguese Civil Procedure Code (Código
_do Processo Civil) being:_

        - there are no doubts regarding the authenticity of the document containing the judgement nor
regarding the reasoning of the judgment;

        - the judgment is final and enforceable (“res judicata”) in the jurisdiction where the decision is
rendered;

        - the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court was not obtained by legal fraud (“fraus legis”) and does not
relate to a matter on which Portuguese courts have exclusive jurisdiction;

        - the judgment of the U.S. Court does not refer to a matter that has been decided by a Portuguese
court or that is being subject to a proceeding before a Portuguese Court, except if the judgment
of the U.S. Court prevents this jurisdiction;

        - the defendant was duly served process by the U.S. Court in accordance with its own procedural
laws and the defendant had the opportunity to defend himself (princípio do contraditório) with
equal defense rights (princípio da igualdade das partes);

        - the enforcement of the judgment will not lead to an outcome which is manifestly contrary to
Portuguese international public policy rules; and


-----

        - the request of recognition of a judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the
United States may be challenged if the party against whom the judgment was rendered is a
Portuguese citizen or a Portuguese company and the result of the judgment would be more
favorable to said party if the United States’ court had applied Portuguese law (assuming that the
Portuguese law would be applicable according to the Portuguese rules of conflict of laws).

**The Dominican Republic**

The Dominican Republic is not a party to any treaties providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments rendered in foreign courts in legal proceedings with respect to civil and commercial matters. Therefore,
the Issuer has been advised by Castillo y Castillo, its Dominican counsel, that under current applicable Dominican
law, a valid final and conclusive judgment issued by a competent court located outside of the Dominican Republic
would be enforced in the Dominican Republic subject to obtaining an exequatur issued by a competent court of
the Dominican Republic. Based on current applicable Dominican law, the courts of the Dominican Republic
should issue an exequatur in respect of a judgment obtained in a foreign court if:

(i) such judgment complies with all formalities required for the enforceability thereof under the applicable
laws of the foreign jurisdiction where it was issued;

(ii) such judgment has been translated into Spanish, together with related documents and satisfies the
authentication requirements of Dominican law;

(iii) the document containing the judgment being submitted for exequatur has been issued following legal
requirements existing in the foreign jurisdiction where it was issued, for such document to be used as
valid evidence in a court of law;

(iv) the document containing the judgment being submitted for exequatur has been legalized or certified by
apostille, and meets all other requirements necessary for its authenticity in the Dominican Republic;

(v) the document containing the judgment being submitted for exequatur was issued by a competent court;

(vi) the decision being submitted for exequatur meets all requirements set forth by Dominican law for the
judgment to be considered valid;

(vii) valid service of process was made upon defendant, personally or at defendant´s domicile, in cases where
the judgment was issued in absentia of defendant;

(viii) is not irreconcilable with a prior judgment issued in another country among the same parties, in a
litigation process having the same objective and the same cause, when such prior decision is susceptible
of being ratified by Dominican courts;

(ix) provisions set forth in Chapter II of International Private Law No. 544-14 have not been violated;

(x) was issued after an opportunity was given to the defendant to present its defense;

(xi) is not subject to further appeal; and,

(xii) recognition is not against Dominican public policy.

###### REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE ON THE REVIEW OF CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 Introduction

 We have reviewed the accompanying condensed interim consolidated financial statements of Altice International S.à r.l. (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (the "Group"), which comprise the interim consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2021, the interim consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the three-month period then ended and the notes to the condensed interim consolidated financial statements ("the Condensed interim consolidated financial statements"). 

 The Board of Managers is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” as adopted by the European Union. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated interim financial statements based on our review.

 Scope of Review

 We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” as adopted, for Luxembourg, by the Institut des Réviseurs d’Entreprises. A review of condensed interim consolidated financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

###### Conclusion

 Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Condensed interim consolidated financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as adopted by the European Union.

 3.    Significant events

 The following changes occurred during the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, which impacted the scope of consolidation compared to that presented in the annual consolidated financial statements.

 3.1.    Acquisitions and disposals in the current period

 IBC Acquisition Israel 

 On September 15, 2020, HOT Telecommunications Systems Ltd (HOT) announced that it has taken a minority stake in IBC Israel Broadband (IBC). Post-closing, HOT became an equal partner in the IBC Partnership (that holds 70% of IBC's share capital), together with Cellcom and Israel Infrastructure Fund (IIF) and HOT holds indirectly 23.3% of IBC's share capital, through an investment in the company of €44.6 million, substantially equal to the investment made by each of Cellcom and IIF. There is an agreement between IBC and HOT, under which HOT undertakes to purchase an indefeasible right, or IRU, to use IBC's fibre-optic network. There is also a service agreement between IBC and HOT, under which IBC undertakes to purchase certain services from HOT. The transaction was closed on February 11, 2021 following the regulatory and third-party approvals. Following the closing of the transaction, HOT exercises a significant influence over IBC, that is accounted for under the equity method based on the provisions of IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.

 3.2.     Acquisitions and disposals in the prior period

 3.2.1.   Sale of a 25% equity stake in OMTEL 

 On January 2, 2020, Altice Europe announced the sale of the 25% equity interest held by PT Portugal in Belmont Infra Holding S.A. (“Belmont”), that owns 100% in a tower company OMTEL, to Cellnex Telecom S.A.. Total cash proceeds amounted to €201.0 million. The total capital gain recorded for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020 amounted to €97.7 million (please refer to note 4.3.2.2).

 The sale by PT Portugal of its 25% equity interest in OMTEL is part of a larger transaction pursuant to which Cellnex Telecom S.A. acquired 100% of the share capital of OMTEL. In September 2018, at the time of its sale

###### Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements

 of OMTEL to a consortium including Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and Horizon Equity Partners, PT Portugal had reinvested €108.8 million for a 25% equity interest in OMTEL.

 3.2.2. Closing of the partnership with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and the sale of 49.99% interest in FastFiber (formerly known as Altice Portugal FTTH)

 On December 12, 2019, PT Portugal entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners regarding the sale of a 49.99% interest in the Portuguese fibre business to be carved-out into a dedicated wholesale vehicle, FastFiber (formerly known as Altice Portugal FTTH), comprising of the fibre passive infrastructure assets and rights, related contracts and underlying agreements, thereby creating a nationwide fibre wholesaler in Portugal. On April 17, 2020, the transaction was closed and the Group received €1,576.0 million of proceeds from this transaction, for the sale of 49.99% of the share capital of FastFiber (€773.3 million) and for the sale of 49.99% of the existing intercompany loan (€799.8 million), which was simultaneously converted into mandatory convertible notes (refer to note 8.7.5). The proceeds from the transaction were partly used to further deleverage the Group’s debt. Furthermore, the Group recorded a receivable representing the net present value of an earnout of €375 million due December 2021. A second earnout is due in December 2026 subject to some performance conditions and the Company did not take into consideration this second earnout in the valuation of the purchase price and thus the capital gain recognised at closing of the transaction. Following the closing of the transaction, PT Portugal continues to control and fully consolidate FastFiber. The transaction resulted in the recognition of a non- controlling interest of €4.0 million and a gain of €1,111.5 million in equity.

 FastFiber will sell wholesale services to all operators at the same financial terms. MEO will sell technical services to FastFiber for the construction, the subscriber connection and the maintenance of its fibre network.

 3.3.     Other significant events

 Portugal pre-retirement program 

 In connection with an ongoing transformation process of the Group in Portugal, in a severe context resulting not only from the COVID-19 pandemic but also from a hostile and troubled regulatory environment, some of the Group companies in Portugal have launched a voluntary employee reduction program in March 2021. This program is aimed at employees of 50 years old or more and those that decide to enroll in the program, subject to the companies’ acceptance, have their employment agreements terminated and will be entitled to receive a monthly fixed compensation up to retirement age corresponding to a percentage of their previous remuneration. The deadline for employees to enroll in the program has finished in the second quarter, but the selection process of the employees that will be allowed to terminate their employment agreements under this pre-retirement scheme is still ongoing. As of March 31, 2021, management considered that the conditions for recording a liability were met under IAS 19 Employee benefits and thus a liability was recognised in the caption "provisions" in the statement of financial position and in the caption “other (expense) and income” of the income statement for an amount of €241.1 million, relating to approximately 750 employees and corresponding primarily to the present value of salaries payable up to retirement age to the employees that agreed to terminate their employment agreements under pre-retirement schemes. Based on information up to date, the Company expects to record an additional liability in the second quarter of 2021 relating to approximately 200 employees.

    Segment reporting

 4.1.    Definition of segments

 Given the geographical spread of the entities within the Group, analysis by geographical area is fundamental in determining the Group’s strategy and managing its different businesses. The Group’s chief operating decision maker is the Board of Managers. The Board of Managers analyses the Group’s results across geographies, and certain key areas by activity. The presentation of the segments here is consistent with the reporting used internally by the Board of Managers to track the Group’s operational and financial performance. The businesses that the Group owns and operates do not show significant seasonality, except for the mobile residential and business services, which can show significant changes in sales at year end and at the end of the summer season (the “back to school” period). The business services are also impacted by the timing of preparation of the annual budgets of public and private sector companies. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies.

 The segments that are presented are detailed below:
  Portugal: The Group owns Portugal Telecom (“PT Portugal”), the largest telecom operator in Portugal. PT Portugal caters to fixed residential, mobile residential and business services clients using the MEO brand. This segment also includes the Altice Technical Services entities in Portugal. 
  Israel: Fixed and mobile services are provided using the HOT telecom, HOT mobile and HOT net brands to residential and business services clients. HOT also produces award winning exclusive content that it distributes using its fixed network, as well as content application called Next and OTT services through Next Plus. This segment also includes the Altice Technical Services entity in Israel. 
  Dominican Republic: The Group provides fixed residential, mobile residential and business services using the Altice brand. This segment also includes the Altice Technical Services entity in the Dominican Republic.
  Teads: Provides digital advertising solutions. 
  Others: Corporate entities are reported under “Others”.

 4.2.    Financial Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”)

 The Board of Managers has defined certain financial KPIs that are tracked and reported by each operating segment every month to the senior executives of the Company. The Board of Managers believes that these indicators offer them the best view of the operational and financial efficiency of each segment, and this follows best practices in the rest of the industry, thus providing investors and other analysts a suitable base to perform their analysis of the Group’s results.

 The financial KPIs tracked by the Board of Managers are:
  Revenues: by segment and in terms of activity,
  Adjusted EBITDA: by segment,
  Capital expenditure (“Capex”): by segment, and
  Operating free cash flow (“OpFCF”): by segment.

 4.2.1.  Revenues

 Additional information on the revenue split is presented as follows:
  Residential revenue o Fixed: revenues from fixed services to B2C customers; o Mobile: revenues from mobile services to B2C subscribers; o Equipment business to B2C subscribers;
  Business services: revenues from B2B customers, wholesale and other revenues; and
  Media: media and advertisement revenues in Teads. 


-----

###### Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements

 Intersegment revenues mainly relate to services rendered by certain centralized Group functions (relating to centralized research) to the operational segments of the Group. 

 4.2.2.  Non-GAAP measures

 Adjusted EBITDA, Capex and OpFCF are non-GAAP measures. These measures are useful to readers of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements as they provide a measure of operating results excluding certain items that the Group’s management believe are either outside of its recurring operating activities, or items that are non-cash. Excluding such items enables trends in the Group’s operating results and cash flow generation to be more easily observable. The non-GAAP measures are used by the Group internally to manage and assess the results of its operations, make decisions with respect to investments and allocation of resources, and assess the performance of management personnel. Such performance measures are also the de facto metrics used by investors and other members of the financial community to value other companies operating in the same industry as the Group and thus are a basis for comparability between the Group and its peers. Moreover, the debt covenants of the Group are based on the Adjusted EBITDA and other associated metrics. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA used in the covenants has not changed with the adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases by the Group. 

 4.2.2.1.  Adjusted EBITDA

 Following the application of IFRS 16 Leases, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, other expenses and income (capital gains, non-recurring litigation, restructuring costs) and share-based expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IAS 17 Leases for operating leases). This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating income as the effects of depreciation, amortization and impairment, excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, do ultimately affect the operating results. Operating results presented in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements are in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.

 4.2.2.2.  Capex

 Capex is an important indicator to follow, as the profile varies greatly between activities:
  The fixed business has fixed Capex requirements that are mainly discretionary (network, platforms, general), and variable capex requirements related to the connection of new customers and the purchase of Customer Premises Equipment (TV decoder, modem, etc.).
  Mobile Capex is mainly driven by investment in new mobile sites, upgrade to new mobile technology and licenses to operate; once engaged and operational, there are limited further Capex requirements.
  Other Capex is mainly related to costs incurred in acquiring content rights.

 4.2.2.3.  Operating free cash flow 

 OpFCF is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capex. This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating cash flow as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with IAS 7 Statement of Cashflows.

 4.3.    Segment results

 4.3.1. Operating profit by segment

###### 5.    Goodwill

 Goodwill is tested at the level of each GCGU (“Group Cash-Generating Unit”) or CGU annually for impairment and whenever changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill was tested at the CGU/GCGU level for impairment as of December 31, 2020. The CGU/GCGU is at the country level where the subsidiaries operate. The recoverable amounts of the GCGUs are determined based on their value in use. The Group determined value in use for purposes of its impairment testing and, accordingly, did not determine the fair value less cost of disposal of the GCGUs. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are primarily the pre-tax discount rates, the terminal growth rate, revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures. Following the application of IFRS 16 Leases, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, other expenses and incomes (capital gains, non-recurring litigation, restructuring costs) and share-based expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IAS 17 Leases for operating lease).

 The Board of Managers and the Group’s senior executives have determined that there have not been any changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. In addition, there were no significant changes in assets or liabilities in any CGU/GCGU. Therefore, no updated impairment testing was performed, nor any impairment recorded, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021.

-----

###### Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements

 €1,857.1 million as at March 31, 2021, an increase of €18.0 million compared to December 31, 2020. Details of the main items within the caption, and the movements from the prior period, are detailed below.

 8.7.1.  Lease liabilities

 Leases relate to the current and non-current lease liabilities recorded in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases. 

 8.7.2.  Reverse factoring

 Through the use of reverse factoring structures, the Group extends its payment terms up to 360 days, reducing its requirements for working capital. The contractual arrangements in place permit the supplier to obtain the amounts invoiced at agreed payment terms with the amounts paid by the banks that participate in the reverse factoring structure. The Group will repay the banks the full invoice amount, with interest, on the scheduled payment date as required by the reverse factoring agreement. Based on the scheduled payment dates, the amounts payable under this arrangement are accounted for as current liabilities. As the amounts are payable to the participating banks, the amounts have been presented under Other financial liabilities. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, the cash flows related to reverse factoring are presented under Changes in working capital or Payments to acquire tangible and intangible assets depending on the nature of the expenditure, and in addition in the financing flows are presented under Payments made to suppliers through factoring arrangements and Payments made to factoring companies. The increase in reverse factoring as at March 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 is due to the combination of timing of reverse factoring capacity with the banks. 

 8.7.3.  Accrued interest

 Accrued interest is the amount of interest due at the reporting date regarding the Company’s outstanding debentures and loans from financial institutions. The decrease in accrued interest is the consequence of the refinancing transactions in 2020 which have led to permanent interest cost savings and consequently a decrease in accrued interest. 

 8.7.4.  Put options with non-controlling interests

 The Group executes agreements with the non-controlling interests in certain acquisitions whereby the non- controlling interests have the option to sell their non-controlling interests to the Group. These instruments are measured at their fair value at the reporting date. 

 8.7.5.  Mandatory Convertible Notes Portugal 

 On April 17, 2020, PT Portugal and Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners entered into a subscription agreement regarding the issuance and subscription of €1,600.0 million mandatory convertible notes in which the parties subscribed considering the percentage of interest in equity of FastFiber. The €848.8 million relates to the financial liability of the Group towards Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners, consisting of the notional amount of €799.8 million and an additional subscription of €49.0 million. The notes bear interest on their aggregate principal amount at the fixed rate of 6.00% per annum. Interest is due in May and November of each year. At any time on or after the date that is twenty years after the date of issue, all or part of the notes issued can be converted into shares with mutual consent. The principle of the convertible notes do not have a stated maturity and will never become payable in cash.

 8.7.6.  Mandatory Convertible Notes Altice Luxembourg

 The Mandatory Convertible Notes (“MCN”) were issued for an aggregate amount of €2,055 million, which were entirely subscribed by the Company’s sole shareholder, Altice Luxembourg. These instruments are compound financial instruments that contain both a liability and an equity component. As a result of the full reimbursement  of Altice Luxembourg senior debt in the first quarter of 2020, the Company obtained the right to convert all or part of the MCN issued into shares with no limitation in time up until the maturity date. The Company had no obligation to pay the MCN interest beyond the conversion date. As a result, the net present value of future interest payments for the period after March 31, 2020 was released from Other financial liabilities to Net result on extinguishment of a financial liability for an amount of €661.3 million in the condensed consolidated statement of income. 
 On December 30, 2020, the existing agreement was amended with a revised maturity date of December 31, 2023 and an interest rate which is based on the annual interest rate accrued on the Company’s Senior Debt. Following


-----

###### Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements

 the amended agreement, the existing liability was derecognised and a new liability was recorded, resulting in the recognition of an interest expense of €17.9 million and an extinguishment of debt of €478.3 million. The non- current portion of the MCN liability recorded at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 are €181.7 million and €180.0 million respectively. The current portion of the MCN liability recorded at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 are €175.0 million and €173.9 million respectively.

###### During the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, there were no transfers of financial assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy. There are no non-recurring fair value measurements. The table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy. It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value. 

 9.1.1.   New put and call options

 During the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, the Group did not enter into any new call-put option contracts. 

 9.1.2.   Fair value hierarchy

 The following table provides information about the fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities and which level in the fair value hierarchy they are classified.

###### 9.1.3.   Information on valuation techniques

 9.1.3.1. Investments in listed entities 

 Quoted prices directly available from an active market are used to source the fair value, i.e. the quoted share price of the listed investments in Partner Co. These valuations are directly observable in an open market and therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

 9.1.3.2.  Derivative financial instruments

 Future cash flows are estimated using market observable data at the end of the reporting period (namely, forward exchange rates and interest rates) and the contracted rates of the derivative discounted at a rate that reflects the counterparty credit risk. Since model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgement, the Company has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

 9.1.3.3.  Put options

 Each contract has specific terms and conditions, and the valuation is performed using the contracted terms and assessment against market comparable information where appropriate. For example, the exercise price in the option may be determined based on an EBITDA multiple minus the net financial debt. In all instances, the probabilities of the option being exercised is determined using management’s best estimate and judgement. The resulting fair value is discounted using appropriate discount rates of the related funding pool. These models use a variety of inputs that use judgements not able to be verified externally, therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

 9.1.3.4.  Call options

 The valuation is derived by calculating the intrinsic value, being the difference in the value of the underlying asset and the options exercise price, and time value of the option, which accounts for the passage of time until the option expires. Various inputs are used, including the price of the underlying asset and its volatility, the strike price and maturity in the contract, and the risk-free rate and dividend yield. The model calculates the possible prices of the underlying asset and their respective probability of occurrence, given these inputs. These models use a variety of inputs that use judgements not able to be verified externally, therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

 9.1.4.  Assumptions with management judgement used in fair value measurement

 The instruments in Level 3 are the put and call options with the non-controlling interests in acquired entities. The valuation methods used to determine the fair value of these instruments include certain inputs that do not use publicly available information and therefore require management’s judgement. Those with significant impact on the fair value of the instruments concerned are deemed to be categorized as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Further details on these valuation methods and the associated inputs using judgements and which can have a significant impact on the fair value are presented below.

**Effective tax rate** **13%** **(2)%**

###### The Group is required to use an estimated annual effective tax rate to measure the income tax benefit or expense recognised in an interim period.
 The Group recorded an income tax benefit of €23.9 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, reflecting an effective tax rate of 13% compared to an income tax benefit of €16.6 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, reflecting an effective tax rate of 2%. The non-deductible financial expenses and other permanent differences had the effect of lowering the Group’s effective tax rate for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021. Without the effect of the capital gain in Portugal related to the disposal of a 25% equity stake in OMTEL on January 2, 2020 (please refer to note 3.2.1) and the gain resulting from the derecognition of the net present value of future interest payments for the MCN (please refer to note 8.7.6), the effective tax rate for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020 would have been 24%.

 Income tax litigation

 There was no significant development in existing tax litigations since the publication of the annual consolidated financial statements that have had, or that may have, a significant effect on the financial position of the Group, except the following:


-----

###### Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements

  In the context of the VAT audit conducted by the Israeli VAT Authority for the tax years 2013-2019, Cool Holdings Ltd and Hadaros 2012 Ltd received on April 29, 2021, a VAT reassessment notice for a total amount of €151.4 million. The VAT assessment is related to accrued interest on intercompany bonds issued by Cool Holdings Ltd and Hadaros 2012 Ltd. Based on advice received, the Company’s management believes it has good arguments to counter the reassessment. As of March 31, 2021, no provision has been recorded in the condensed interim financial statements.

  MEO has received a preliminary tax inspection report for the year 2018 where tax authorities are proposing a stamp tax correction of approximately €29 million relating to the demerger of the mobile tower business unit in that year, following which PT Portugal disposed of a 75% stake in that business. MEO expects to submit its preliminary defense until May 24, 2021, after which tax authorities will decide to include or not this matter in the final inspection report. MEO believes it has good arguments to counter the possible correction. As of March 31, 2021, no provision has been recorded in the condensed interim financial statements.

###### The net finance costs for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 was €32.9 million compared to net income of €493.6 million for the same period in 2020. The change was mainly attributed to:
  lower interest relative to gross financial debt due to refinancing activities in 2020, reflecting lower interest on long term debt;
  lower realized and unrealized gains on derivative instruments of €90.0 million compared to gains of €192.9 million for the same period in 2020 due to lower positive variation in the mark to market of the swaps of Altice Financing;
  lower net foreign exchange losses of €76.9 million compared to losses of €144.7 million for the same period in 2020 as a result on the foreign exchange effect on long term debt of the Dominican Republic;
  gain on extinguishment of financial liability for the three months ended March 31, 2020, which amounted to €589.7 million as a result of the derecognition of the net present value of future interest payments for the MCN (please refer to note 8.7.6) and redemptions of the Group’s notes in Altice Financing and Altice Finco in 2020. 

 12.    Contractual obligations and commercial commitments

 During the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, no significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments have been signed as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. 

 13.    Litigation

 In the normal course of its activities, the Group is accused in a certain number of governmental, arbitration and administrative lawsuits. Provisions are recognised by the Group when management believe that it is more likely than not that such lawsuits will result in an amount to be settled by the Group, and the magnitude of the amount can be reliably estimated. The magnitude of the provisions recognised is based on the best estimate of the level of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, on a case-by-case basis, considering that the occurrence of events during the legal action involves constant re-estimation of the risk.

### CONSOLIDATED
 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED
 DECEMBER 31, 2020


-----

###### To the Board of Managers of Altice International S.à r.l. 5, rue Eugène Ruppert L-2453 Luxembourg Luxembourg

 REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE

 Opinion
 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Altice International S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries (the "Group"), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020, and the consolidated statement of income, consolidated statement of other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. 
 In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2020 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
 Basis for opinion
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (“Law of 23 July 2016”) and with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the “Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier” (“CSSF”). Our responsibilities under the Law of 23 July 2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF are further described in the « Responsibilities of “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial statements » section of our report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, including International Independence Standards, issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (“IESBA Code”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
 Other matter
 The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2019 were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those consolidated financial statements on 10 April 2020.
 Responsibilities of the Board of Managers for the consolidated financial statements
 The Board of Managers is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Board of Managers determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Managers is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Managers either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 Responsibilities of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
 The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are


-----

###### considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
 As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

 — Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
 to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 — Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
 appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

 — Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
 related disclosures made by the Board of Managers.

 — Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Managers' use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
 based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

 — Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the
 disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

 — Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business
 activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

 We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

 1.1. Basis of presentation of the consolidated financial statements

 The consolidated financial statements of the Group as of December 31, 2020 and for the year then ended (the “consolidated financial statements”) were approved by the Board of Managers and authorized for issue on March 30, 2021.

 The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and for the year then ended are presented in millions of Euros, except as otherwise stated, and have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted in the European Union (“IFRS”). 

 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain properties and financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies.

 Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company considers the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 16 Leases, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in IAS 2 Inventories or value in use in IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.

 For financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:

 • Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date;
 • Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
 • Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability (please refer to note 19). 


-----

###### Where the accounting treatment of a specific transaction is not addressed by any accounting standard and interpretation, the Board of Managers applies its judgment to define and apply accounting policies that provide information consistent with the general IFRS concepts: faithful representation and relevance.

 1.2. Significant accounting judgments and estimates

 In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Board of Managers is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not clear from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

 The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

 These judgments and estimates relate principally to the provisions for legal claim, the post-employments benefits, revenue recognition, fair value of financial instruments, deferred taxes, impairment of goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, trade receivables, other receivables and right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are described in the note 2.27. 

 1.3. Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)

 1.3.1. Standards applicable for the reporting period

 The following standards have mandatory application for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020 as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements:

 • Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of Material, effective on or after January 1, 2020;
 • Amendments to IFRS 3 Definition of a Business, effective on or after January 1, 2020; 
 • Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards, effective on or after January 1,
 2020; and

 • Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases, Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions, effective on or after June 1, 2020, with
 early application permitted.

 The application of amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8, IFRS 3 and to References of the Conceptual Framework in IFRS standards had no material impact on the amounts recognised and on the disclosures in these consolidated financial statements.

 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, an amendment to IFRS 16 was issued in May 2020 in order to provide practical relief for lessees in accounting for rent concessions. Under the practical expedient, lessees are not required to assess whether eligible rent concessions are lease modifications. Rent concessions are eligible for practical expedient if they occur as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and if all of the following criteria are met:

 - The change in lease payments results in revised consideration for the lease that is substantially the same as, or less than, the consideration for the lease immediately preceding the change;

 - Any reduction in lease payments affects only payments originally due on or before June 30, 2021;

 - There is no substantive change to the other terms and conditions of the lease.

 The Group has applied the amendment retrospectively and the amendment has no impact on retained earnings as of January 1, 2020. The amount recognised in the income statement for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020 to reflect changes in lease payments arising from rent concessions to which the Group applies the practical expedient for COVID-19 related rent concession is not material.

 In addition, the IFRIC published a decision in November 2019 which establishes that the determination of the enforceable period of a lease and the lease term itself consider broad economic circumstances beyond purely contractual terms. The committee considers that a lease arrangement remains enforceable as long as lessee, or lessor, would have to support a loss or a more than insignificant penalty in the event of termination of the contract. The  assessment of the impact for the Group of the IFRIC decision has been finalised and there was no material impact on


-----

###### the amounts recognised as Right of use and Lease Liabilities at the date of first implementation of IFRS 16 Leases as of January 1, 2019.

 1.3.2. Standards and interpretations not applicable as of reporting date

 The Group has not early adopted the following standards and interpretations, for which application is not mandatory for period started from January 1, 2020 and that may impact the amounts reported:
 • Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture, effective date of the amendments has not yet been determined by the IASB;
 • Amendments in Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1), effective on or after January 1, 2023;
 • Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020, effective on or after January 1, 2022; and
 • Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16), effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, with earlier application permitted.

 The Board of Managers anticipates that the application of those amendments will not have a material impact on amounts reported in respect of the Group's financial assets and financial liabilities.

 1.4. COVID-19 pandemic

 On March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic, highlighting the health risks of the disease. In this context and following regulatory requirements published by governments over the last months in the countries in which the Group operates, the Group activated a response program in order to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

 The COVID-19 pandemic had a limited impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group as of December 31, 2020 and for the twelve-month periods then ended. The Group has been impacted by a decline in handsets sales (low margin activity) in the context of the closure of the shops in many countries where the Group operates, a decrease in roaming revenue and a decline in the advertising businesses (Teads). The impact has remained limited since the beginning of the crisis demonstrating the resilience of the Group’s telecom business in the countries where the Group operates. Although the situation continues to evolve, the Company expects that the COVID-19 pandemic will have limited effects on the Group’s operations and financial performance for future periods.

 In countries where the Group operates, the Group did not benefit from specific programs that required the compliance with particular conditions.

 The Group has taken this situation into account in its estimates, notably those related to the non-current and current assets valuation (including goodwill) (please refer to note 5.1). 

 Based on the above and information in note 31, the Group determined that the going concern assumption is still appropriate.

 Significant accounting policies

 2.1. Basis of consolidation

 2.1.1. Subsidiaries

 Entities are fully consolidated if the Group has all the following:

 • power over the investee;
 • exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
 • the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

 The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. If the Group does not have a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally.


-----

###### The Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether the Group’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:

 • the size of the Group’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote
 holders;

 • potential voting rights held by the Group, other vote holders or other parties;
 • rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
 • any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Group has, or does not have, the current ability to
 direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings.

 Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.

 Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Group and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Group and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Non- controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein.

 Adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.

 2.1.2. Joint arrangements

 In accordance with IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, arrangements subject to joint control are classified as either a joint venture or a joint operation. The classification of a joint arrangement as a joint operation or a joint venture depends upon the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement.

 A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Investment in which the Group is a joint operator recognises its shares in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.

 A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Investment in which the Company is a joint venturer recognises its interest in the joint venture in accordance with the equity method.

 2.1.3. Associates

 Investments, over which the Company exercises significant influence, but not control, are accounted for under the equity method. Such investees are referred to as “associates” throughout these consolidated financial statements.

 Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over these policies. Associates are initially recognised at cost at acquisition date. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of income and expenses, from the date significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.

 The interest income and expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements of the Group on loans with associates have not been eliminated in the consolidated statement of income and therefore are still recorded in the consolidated financial statements.

 2.2. Foreign currencies

 The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements is Euro. The functional currency, which is the currency that best reflects the economic environment in which the subsidiaries of the Group operate and conduct their transactions, is separately determined for the Group’s subsidiaries and associates and is used to measure their financial position and operating results.


-----

###### 2.2.1. Monetary transactions

 Transactions denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary are translated at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate and the resulting exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated statement of income.

 2.2.2. Translation of financial statements denominated in foreign currencies

 Assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into euros using exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. The consolidated statements of income and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rates for the period. Foreign exchange differences resulting from such translations are either recorded in shareholders’ equity under “Currency translation reserve” (for the Group share) or under “Non-controlling interests” (for the share of non-controlling interests) as deemed appropriate.

 The exchange rates of the main currencies were as follows:

**Foreign exchange rates used** **Annual average rate** **Rate at the reporting date**

**(€)** **2020** **2019** **Dec 31, 2020** **Dec 31, 2019**

Dominican Pesos (DOP) 0.01546 0.01741 0.01405 0.0168

Israeli Shekel (ILS) 0.25489 0.25062 0.25441 0.25781

United States Dollar (USD) 0.87586 0.89327 0.81800 0.89055

###### 2.3. Revenue recognition

 Revenue from the Group’s activities is mainly composed of television, broadband internet, fixed and mobile telephony subscription, installations fees invoiced to residential and business clients and advertising revenues.

 Revenue comprises the expected consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, discounts and after eliminating intercompany sales within the Group. 

 In accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the revenue recognition model includes five steps for analysing transactions so as to determine when to recognise revenue and at what amount: 

 (1) Identifying the contract with the customer.  (2) Identifying separate performance obligations in the contract.  (3) Determining the transaction price.  (4) Allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations.  (5) Recognizing revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied.

 For bundled packages, the Group accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct – i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if the product or service is distinct from other items in the bundle. The consideration is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the market prices at which the Group sells the mobile devices and telecommunications services separately. This could lead to the recognition of a contract asset – a receivable arising from the customer contract that has not yet legally come into existence – in the statement of financial position. 

 The contract asset is amortized over the enforceable period. Enforceable period has been determined for each agreement. It represents the period over which rights and obligation are enforceable. This period is determined not only by the commitment period as stated in the contract, but also by business practices and contracts mechanisms (early renewal, exit options, penalties and other clauses).

 2.3.1. Revenues from the sale of equipment

 The Group recognises revenues when a customer takes possession of the device, which is the performance obligation. This usually occurs when the customer signs a new contract. The amount of revenue includes the sale of mobile devices and ancillary equipment for those devices. For mobile devices sold separately, customers pay in full at the point of sale or in several instalments (credit agreement).


-----

###### 2.3.2. Revenues on separable components of bundle packages

 Revenues from telephone packages are recorded as a sale with multiple components. Revenues from sales of handsets (mobile phones and other) are recorded upon activation of the line, net of discounts granted to the customer via the point of sale and the costs of activation.

 When elements of these transactions cannot be identified or analysed separately from the main offer, they are considered as related elements and the associated revenues are recognised in full over the duration of the contract or the expected duration of the customer relationship.

 2.3.3. Revenue from service

 Revenues from subscriptions for basic cable services, digital television pay, Internet and telephony (fixed and mobile) are recognised in revenue on a straight-line basis over the subscription period; revenues from telephone calls are recognised in revenue when the service is rendered in accordance with the term of the contract.

 The Group sells certain telephone subscriptions based on plans under which the call minutes for a given month can be carried over to the next month if they are not used. The minutes carried over are recorded as a liability based on the proportion of total telephone subscription revenues they represent. Revenues related to carried over minutes are recognized when the minutes are used or when they expire.

 Revenues relative to incoming and outgoing calls and off-plan calls are recorded when the service is provided. Revenues generated by vouchers sold to distributors and by prepaid mobile cards are recorded each time use is made by the end customer, as from when the vouchers and cards are activated. Any unused portion is recorded in contract liabilities at the end of the reporting period. Revenues are in any case recognised upon the expiry date of the cards, or when the use of the vouchers is statistically unlikely.

 Sales of services to subscribers managed by the Group on behalf of content providers (principally special numbers and SMS+) are recorded on a gross basis, or net of repayments to the content providers when the content providers are responsible for the content and determine the pricing applied to the subscriber. Please refer to note 2.3.8 for a consideration of when the Group acts as a principal or an agent.

 The costs of access to the service or installation costs principally billed to operator and corporate clients in relation to DSL connection services, bandwidth services, and IP connectivity services, are recognised over the expected duration of the contractual relationship and the provision of the principal service.

 Installation service revenue is deferred and recognised over the benefit period. For business service subscribers, the benefit period is the contract term, which is defined and agreed for 2 years or more. For residential customers, there is no commitment period and installation costs are recognised over the estimated benefit period.

 Revenues linked to switched services are recognised each time traffic is routed. Revenues from bandwidth, IP connectivity, high-speed local access and telecommunications services are recorded as and when the services are delivered to the customers.

 2.3.4. Access to telecommunications infrastructures

 The Group provides its operator clients with access to its telecommunications infrastructures by means of different types of contracts: rental, hosting contracts or concessions of Indefeasible Rights of Use (‘‘IRU’’). The IRU contracts grant the use of an asset (ducting, fibre optic or bandwidth) for a specified period. The Group remains the owner of the asset. Proceeds generated by rental contracts, hosting contracts in Netcenters, and infrastructure IRUs are recognised over the duration of the corresponding contracts, except where these are defined as a finance lease, in which case the equipment is considered as having been sold on credit.

 In the case of IRUs, and sometimes rentals or service agreements, the service is paid in advance in the first year. These prepayments, which are non-refundable, are recorded in deferred income within Contract liabilities caption (current and non-current) in the Statement of Financial Position and recognised over the expected term of the related agreements.


-----

###### 2.3.5. Sales of infrastructure

 The Group builds infrastructure on behalf of certain clients. The average duration of the construction work is less than one year; therefore, revenues are recorded when ownership is transferred. A provision is recognised when any contracts are expected to prove onerous.

 2.3.6. Advertising revenues

 Advertising revenues are recognised when commercials are aired. 

 For revenue related to space to display video advertisements online sold either directly to clients or to advertising agencies (the clients), the Group generates revenue when a user clicks on the banner ad or views the advertisement. The Group prices the advertising campaigns on a cost per view (“CPV”) model or a cost per mille (“CPM”) model based on the number of views generated by users on each advertising campaign. Revenue is recognised when four basic criteria are met: 

 • persuasive evidence exists of an arrangement with the client reflecting the terms and conditions under which
 the services will be provided (insertion order, which are commonly based on specified CPVs and related campaign budgets); 

 • services have been provided or delivery has occurred. Income relating to services provided is recorded based
 on the stage of completion of the service. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the work performed at the reporting date. For on-going service agreements, the stage of completion is prorated over time. In case of negative margin for a campaign, a provision for an onerous contract is booked;

 • the fee is fixed or determinable; and 
 • collection is probable. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including the creditworthiness
 of a client, the size and nature of a client’s website and transaction history. 

 Amounts billed or collected in excess of revenue recognised are included as deferred revenue. An example of such deferred revenue would be arrangements whereby clients request or are required by the Group to pay in advance of delivery.

 2.3.7. Income from credit arrangements

 Revenues deriving from long-term credit arrangements (such as the sale of devices in instalments) are recorded at the present value of the future cash flows (against long-term receivables) and are discounted in accordance with market interest rates. The difference between the original amount of the credit and the present value, as aforesaid, is spread over the length of the credit period and recorded as interest income over the length of the credit period.

 2.3.8. Gross versus net revenue recognition

 The Group determines whether it is acting as a principal or as an agent. The Group is acting as a principal if it controls a promised good or service before it is transferred to a customer. 

 Indicators for acting as a principal include: (1) the Group is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service, (2) the Group has inventory risk in the specified good or service and (3) the Group has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. 

 On the other hand, the Group is acting as an agent or an intermediary, if these criteria are not met. When the Group is acting as an agent, revenue is presented on a net basis in the statement of income. When the Group is acting as principal, revenue is presented on a gross basis.

 2.4. Finance costs, net

 Finance costs, net primarily comprise:

 • Interest charges and other expenses paid for financing operations recognised at amortized cost;
 • Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments;
 • Ineffective portion of hedges that qualify for hedge accounting;
 • Foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary transactions;
 • Interest income relating to cash and cash equivalents;


-----

###### • Gains/losses on extinguishment of financial liability; and
 • Investment securities and investment securities pledged as collateral which are classified as trading securities
 and are stated at fair value with realized and unrealized holding gains and losses included in net financial result.

 Please refer to the detailed accounting policies in notes 2.15, 2.19, 2.20 and 2.22.

 2.5. Taxation

 Taxes on income in the income statement include current taxes and deferred taxes. The tax expenses or income in respect of current taxes or deferred taxes are recognised in profit or loss unless they relate to items that are recorded directly in equity, in these cases the tax effect is reflected under the relevant equity item.

 2.5.1. Current tax

 The current tax liability is measured using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period as well as adjustments required in connection with the tax liability in respect of previous years.

 2.5.2. Deferred tax

 Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, tax loss carry-forwards and unused tax credits, insofar as it is probable that a taxable profit will be available, or when a current tax liability exists to make use of those deductible temporary differences, tax loss carry-forwards and unused tax credits, except where the deferred tax asset associated with the deductible temporary difference is generated by initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination, and that, at the transaction date, does not impact earnings, nor income tax profit or loss.

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the expected tax rates for the year during which the asset will be realized or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax regulations) enacted or substantially enacted by the closing date. They are reviewed at the end of each year, in line with any changes in applicable tax rates.

 The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each closing date and revalued or reduced to the extent that it is more or less probable that a taxable profit will be available to allow the deferred tax asset to be utilized. When assessing the probability of a taxable profit being available, account is taken, primarily, of prior years’ results, forecasted future results, non-recurring items unlikely to occur in the future and the tax strategy.

 Taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and other associated entities, deferred tax liabilities are recorded except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied: the parent, investor or venturer can control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.

 All deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position as non-current assets and non- current liabilities, respectively. Deferred taxes are offset if an enforceable legal right exists, which enables the offsetting of a current tax asset against a current tax liability and the deferred taxes relate to the same entity, which is chargeable to tax, and to the same tax authority.

 2.5.3. Uncertain tax positions 

 The Group determines the accounting tax position when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments based on the provisions of IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income tax. Based on the Interpretation, the Group determines whether uncertain tax positions are assessed separately or as a group and assess whether it is probable that a tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment used, or proposed to be used, by an entity in its income tax filings: 

 • If yes, the Group determines its accounting tax position consistently with the tax treatment used or planned to be used in its income tax filings. 

 • If no, the Group reflects the effect of uncertainty in determining its accounting tax position using either the most likely amount or the expected value method.


-----

###### 2.6. Site dismantling and restoration

 The Company has a contractual obligation to dismantle and restore the sites of its mobile and fixed network upon expiry of a lease, if the lease is not renewed. Considering this obligation, site restoration costs are capitalized based on:

 • an average unit cost of restoring sites;

 • assumptions concerning the lifespan of the dismantling asset; and

 • a discount rate.

 2.7. Goodwill and business combinations

 Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group from the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

 At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value, except that:

 • deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;

 • liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payments at the acquisition date; and

 • assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.

 Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.

 Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Other types of non-controlling interests are measured at fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in the applicable IFRS standard.

 When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. 

 Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, in respect of:

 - the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree;

 - the consideration transferred for the acquiree (or the other amount used in measuring goodwill);

 - in a business combination achieved in stages, the equity interest in the acquiree previously held by the acquirer; and


-----

###### - the resulting goodwill or gain on a bargain purchase.

 The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, or IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss.

 Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

 For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

 A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.

 On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

 Acquisition under common control

 In the absence of specific guidance under IFRS for transactions between entities under common control, the Company considered and applied standards on business combination and transactions between entities under common control issued by the accounting standard-setting bodies in the United States (Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810-10-45-10 and Topic 810-10-55-1B Consolidation and SEC Regulation S-X Article 3A – Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements) and in the United Kingdom (FRS 6 Acquisitions and mergers) to prepare the consolidated financial statements.

 Any existing balance on the share premium account of the new subsidiary undertaking should be brought in by being shown as a movement on Additional Paid in Capital. These movements should be shown in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ equity.

 2.8. Intangible assets

 Intangible assets acquired separately are recorded at cost on initial recognition, with the addition of direct acquisition costs. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value as of the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and less any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets have either definite or indefinite useful lives.

 Assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives and tested for signs that would indicate impairment in value. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least once a year. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits that are expected to derive from the asset are treated as a change in an accounting estimate which is treated prospectively.


-----

**_The useful lives of the intangible assets are as follows:_** **Duration**

Software 3 years

Brands 5 to 15 years

Customer relations 4 to 17 years

Licences over the period of licences

Indefeasible Right of use 3-30 years

Subscriber purchase costs based on average duration of subscriptions

Franchises finite and indefinite

###### Customer relations established in connection with business combinations that are finite lived are amortized in a manner that reflects the pattern in which the projected net cash inflows to the Company are expected to occur, such as the sum of the years’ digits method, or when such pattern does not exist, using the straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.

 Franchise rights are periodically reviewed to determine if each franchise has a finite life or an indefinite life in accordance with goodwill and other intangible asset financial accounting standards. Accordingly, the Company believes its franchises qualify for indefinite life treatment and are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances. Costs incurred in negotiating and renewing broadband franchises are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the renewal period.

 Other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually as well as where there is an indication that it may be impaired by comparing their carrying amount with their recoverable amount.

 Operating licenses for telephony services are recorded based on the fixed amount paid upon acquisition of the license.

 Investments made in the context of concessions or public service contracts, and linked to the rollout of the telecommunications network, are recorded in intangible assets in accordance with interpretation IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements. The ‘‘intangible asset’’ model stipulated by this interpretation applies when the concession holder receives a right to bill users of the public service and the concession holder is essentially paid by the user. These intangible assets are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the categories of assets in question and the duration of the concession.

 Intangible assets also comprise rights of use or access rights obtained. Amortization is generally calculated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the contractual term and 30 years.

 Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs are capitalised as intangible assets when the following can be demonstrated:

 • the technical feasibility of the project and the availability of the adequate resources for the completion of the intangible assets;

 • the ability of the asset to generate future economic benefit;

 • the ability to measure reliably the expenditures attributable to the asset; and

 • the feasibility and intention of the Group to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.

 Content rights

 Exclusive sports broadcasting rights are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position from the point at which the legally enforceable licence period begins. Rights for which the licence period has not started are disclosed as contractual commitments in note 29. Payments made to acquire broadcasting rights in advance of the legal right to broadcast the programmes are classified as prepayments in the caption “other financial assets” in the statement of financial position. Broadcasting rights are initially recognised at cost and are amortised from the point at which they are available for use, on a straight-line basis over the broadcasting period. The amortisation charge is recorded in the caption “depreciation and amortisation” in the consolidated statement of income. The costs of exclusive in-house content and external content are recognised as an intangible asset. The cost of the rights is recognised at the cost of production of the shows and is amortized based on the actual screenings. The amortisation charge is recorded in the caption “depreciation and amortisation” in the income statement.

 2.9. Impairment of tangible and intangible assets

 At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication


-----

###### exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.

 Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

 Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

 If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

 When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash- generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

 2.10. Property, plant and equipment

 Property, plant and equipment are presented at cost with the addition of direct purchase costs less accumulated depreciation and accumulated losses on impairment and they do not include routine maintenance expenses. The cost includes spare parts and ancillary equipment that can only be used in connection with the plant and machinery.

 Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: 

**_The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment were:_** **Duration**

Buildings 5 to 50 years

Cables and mobile network 5 to 40 years

Converters and modems 3 to 5 years

Computers and ancillary equipment 2 to 8 years

Office furniture and equipment 3 to 15 years

###### Leasehold contracts are depreciated according to the straight-line method during the rental period.

 Elements of a fixed asset item, having a cost that is significant in comparison to the overall cost of the item, are depreciated separately, using the components method. The depreciation is calculated in accordance with the straight- line method at annual rates that are sufficient to depreciate the assets over the length of their estimated useful lives.

 The useful life, depreciation method and residual value of an asset are reviewed at least annually; any changes are accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.

 2.11. Contract costs

 The Group recognises as an asset the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if it expects to recover those costs. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that the Group incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. Commissions to third parties and sales incentives to employees are considered as costs to obtain a contract and are recognised under the balance sheet caption “contract costs”. 

 Assets recognised as contract costs are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. The asset may relate to goods or services to be transferred under a specific anticipated contract. The amortization charge is recognised in the statement of income, within caption “Depreciation, amortization and impairment”.


-----

###### As a practical expedient, the Group recognises the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the Group otherwise would have recognised is one year or less.

 2.12. Leasing

 2.12.1. The Group as a lessee 

 The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract. The Group recognises right- of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of- use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, lease payments made at or before the commencement date and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment.

 At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

 In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset (please refer to note 2.27.2).

 The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

 The Group has the option, under some of its leases, to lease the assets for additional terms. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew (please refer to note 2.27.2). That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. 

 After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew (e.g., a change in business strategy). The Group included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of technical sites due to the significance of these assets to its operations. 

 The recognition and measurement requirements for lessee are also applied to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.

 2.12.2. The Group as lessor

 When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.

 To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. 

 When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interest in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right of use asset arising from the head lease.


-----

###### The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 2.13. Borrowing costs

 Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

 2.14. Government grants

 Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.

 Government grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. Specifically, government grants whose primary condition is that the Company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-current assets are recognised as a deduction of the related asset in the consolidated statement of financial position and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets.

 Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable. The benefit of a government loan at a below-market interest rate is measured at the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest rates.

 2.15. Financial assets

 Trade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

 A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.

 On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The Group did not elect such a designation.

 Debt financial assets are subsequently measured at FVTPL, amortised cost, or FVOCI. 

 The classification is based on two criteria: the Group’s business model for managing the assets; and whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows represent ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the principal amount outstanding (the ‘SPPI criterion’). 

 The classification and measurement of the Group’s debt financial assets are, as follows: 

 • Debt instruments at amortised cost for financial assets that are held within a business model with the objective
 to hold the financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows that meet the SPPI criterion. This category includes the Group’s Trade and other receivables, and Loans included under balance sheet caption “Financial assets” (non-current and current portion). 

 • Debt instruments at FVOCI, with gains or losses recycled to profit or loss on derecognition. The Group has no
 instrument in this new category. 


-----

###### Other financial assets are classified and subsequently measured, as follows: 

 • Equity instruments at FVOCI, with no recycling of gains or losses to profit or loss on derecognition. This
 category only includes equity instruments, which the Group intends to hold for the foreseeable future and which the Group has irrevocably elected to so classify upon initial recognition or transition. The Group classified its quoted and unquoted equity instruments as equity instruments at FVOCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment under IFRS 9. 

 • Financial assets at FVTPL comprise derivative instruments. This category would also include debt instruments
 whose cash flow characteristics fail the SPPI criterion or are not held within a business model whose objective is either to collect contractual cash flows, or to both collect contractual cash flows and sell. Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains and losses arising on remeasurement recognised in the caption “Other Financial expense” or “Other Financial income” in the income statements.

 Under IFRS 9, embedded derivatives are not separated from a host financial asset. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met.

 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities

 Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

 Impairment of financial assets

 Under IFRS 9, accounting for impairment losses for financial assets is based on an expected credit loss (ECL) approach. IFRS 9 requires the Group to record an allowance for ECLs for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive. The shortfall is then discounted at an approximation to the asset’s original effective interest rate.

 For contract assets, trade and other receivables, the Group has applied the standard’s simplified approach and has calculated ECLs based on lifetime expected credit losses. The Group records provision for doubtful debt based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. 

 Call option granted to non-controlling interests

 The call options are derivative financial instruments that are stated at fair value and subsequently re-measured to their fair value at balance sheet date, with any gains and losses arising on remeasurement recognised in the caption “Other Financial expense” or “Other Financial income” in the income statement.

 2.16. Inventories

 Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories comprises costs of purchase and costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated selling costs. Cost of inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method. The Company periodically evaluates the condition and age of inventories and makes provisions for slow moving inventories accordingly.

 2.17. Cash and cash equivalents

 Cash consists of cash in banks and deposits. Cash equivalents are considered as highly liquid investments, including unrestricted short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition or with a maturity of more than three months, but which are redeemable on demand without penalty and which form part of the Group’s cash management.

 2.18. Restricted cash

 Restricted cash can consist of balances dedicated to the repayment of the Company’s liabilities to banking entities in accordance with the Company’s credit agreement and therefore amounts that the Group cannot use at its discretion.


-----

###### Restricted cash can also consist of cash held in escrow to finance certain acquisitions (in the period between the agreement to acquire and the actual closing of the acquisition and the transfer of shares and cash and other considerations). Restricted cash may also consist of guarantees provided by different Group companies to financial institutions related to financing or other activities. Restricted cash is not considered as a component of cash and cash equivalents since such balances are not held for the purposes of meeting short-term cash commitments.

 2.19. Derivatives

 Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered and are subsequently reassessed at their fair value.

 The Company has entered various forward and interest rate swaps (cross currency and fixed/floating) to mitigate risks associated with making investments in currencies other than the functional currency of the underlying component.

 Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The fair value estimate is subject to a credit risk adjustment that reflects the credit risk of the Group and of the counterparty. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.

 2.20. Hedge accounting

 The Group continues to apply the requirement of IAS 39 relating to hedge accounting.

 The Group may designate certain hedging instruments, (which may include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk), as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

 At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.

 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is included in the line ‘other financial expense’.

 Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.

 Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

 2.21. Classification as debt or equity

 Debt and equity instruments issued by a Group entity are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.


-----

###### 2.21.1. Equity instruments

 An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Group entity are recognised at the value of the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

 Repurchase of the Group’s own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments.

 2.22. Financial liabilities

 Debt securities issued are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

 A financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its issue. 

 Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities at amortized cost:

 2.22.1. Financial liabilities at amortized cost

 These financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost calculated based on the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the internal yield rate that exactly discounts future cash flows through the term of the financial liability. Fees, debt issuance and transaction costs are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate over the expected life of the instrument.

 2.22.2. Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.

 Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at FVTPL if they are acquired for sale in the near term. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in profit or loss.

 Derivatives, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, are classified as financial liabilities at FVTPL unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. In the event of a financial instrument that contains one or more embedded derivatives, the entire combined instrument may be designated as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss only upon initial recognition.

 The Group assesses whether embedded derivatives are required to be bifurcated from host contracts when the Group first becomes party to the contract. Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required.

 The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in an active market is determined by reference to quoted market prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date. For financial instruments for which there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. Such techniques include evaluation based on transactions that have been executed recently under market terms, reference to the current market value of another instrument, which is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.

 2.22.3. Liabilities related to put options granted to non-controlling interests

 The Group granted put options to third parties with non-controlling interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries. These options give the holders the right to sell part or all of their investment in these subsidiaries. 

 At inception, in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, when non-controlling interests hold put options enabling them to sell their investment in the Group, a financial liability is recognised for an amount corresponding to the present value of liability assumed and the counterpart of the liability arising from these obligations is:

 • the reclassification as debt of the carrying amount of the corresponding non-controlling interests;


-----

###### • a reduction in the equity attributable to owners of the Company (other reserves attributable to equity holders of the parent) for the difference between the present value of the strike price of the options granted and the carrying amount of non-controlling interests.

 In the absence of specific IFRS guidance, the accounting at the end of each reporting period is as follows, while the non-controlling interest put remains unexercised:

 (1) recognition of the non-controlling interest, including an allocation of profit or loss, allocation of changes in other
 comprehensive income and dividends declared for the reporting period, as required by IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements as mentioned in note 2.1.1;
 (2) derecognition of the non-controlling interest as if it was acquired at that date; (3) recognition of a financial liability at the present value of the amount payable on exercise of the NCI put in
 accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement; and
 (4) the difference between no (2) and (3) above is accounted for as an equity transaction.

 If the NCI put is exercised, the same treatment is applied up to the date of exercise. The amount recognised as the financial liability at that date is extinguished by the payment of the exercise price.

 If the NCI put expires unexercised, the position is unwound so that the non-controlling interest is recognised at the amount it would have been, as if the put option had never been granted (i.e. measured initially at the date of the business combination, and remeasured for subsequent allocations of profit or loss, other comprehensive income and changes in equity attributable to the non-controlling interest). The financial liability is derecognised, with a corresponding credit to the same component of equity.

 The Group is closely monitoring the work of the IASB and the IFRIC, which could lead to a revision of the treatment of put options granted to non-controlling interests.

 2.23. Provisions

 A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as the result of a past event and it is expected that the use of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and it is possible to reliably estimate it. Where the impact is significant, the provision is measured by discounting the forecasted future cash flows, using a pre-tax interest rate that reflects the expectations of the market in respect of the time value of the money and the risks that are specific to the liability.

 The following types of provisions are recorded in the consolidated financial statements:

 2.23.1. Litigations

 A provision regarding claim is recognised when the Group has a present legal commitment or an implicit commitment resulting from a past event; when it is more likely than not that the Group will be required to expand economic resources to clear the commitment, when it is possible to estimate it reliably. When the effect of time is significant, the provision is measured according to the present value.

 2.23.2. Onerous contracts

 Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract.

 2.23.3. Restructuring

 A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the Group.


-----

###### 2.24. Liabilities for employment benefits

 2.24.1. Retirement benefit costs and termination benefits

 Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re- measurement recognised in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss in the period of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.

 Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:

 • service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements);

 • net interest expense or income; and

 • re-measurement.

 The Group presents the service cost and the net interest expense in profit or loss in the line item “Staff cost and employee benefit expenses” and “Other financial expenses” respectively. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past service costs.

 The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.

 A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefit and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs.

 2.24.2. Short-term and other long-term employee benefits

 A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave in the period the related service is rendered at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service.

 Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.

 Liabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee benefits are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows expected to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date.

 2.25. Share-based payments

 2.25.1. Share-based payment transactions of the Company

 Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.

 The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity- settled employee benefits reserve.


-----

###### Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, except where that fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service.

 For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.

 2.25.2. Share-based payment transactions of the acquiree in a business combination

 When the share-based payment awards held by the employees of an acquiree (acquiree awards) are replaced by the Group’s share-based payment awards (replacement awards), both the acquiree awards and the replacement awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment ("market-based measure") at the acquisition date. The portion of the replacement awards that is included in measuring the consideration transferred in a business combination equals the market-based measure of the acquiree awards multiplied by the ratio of the portion of the vesting period completed to the greater of the total vesting period or the original vesting period of the acquiree award. The excess of the market-based measure of the replacement awards over the market-based measure of the acquiree awards included in measuring the consideration transferred is recognised as remuneration cost for post-combination service.

 However, when the acquiree awards expire because of a business combination and the Group replaces those awards when it does not have an obligation to do so, the replacement awards are measured at their market-based measure in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. All market-based measures of the replacement awards are recognised as remuneration cost for post-combination service.

 At the acquisition date, when the outstanding equity-settled share-based payment transactions held by the employees of an acquiree are not exchanged by the Group for its share-based payment transactions, the acquiree share-based payment transactions are measured at their market-based measure at the acquisition date. If the share-based payment transactions have vested by the acquisition date, they are included as part of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree. However, if the share-based payment transactions have not vested by the acquisition date, the market-based measure of the unvested share-based payment transactions is allocated to the non-controlling interest in the acquiree based on the ratio of the portion of the vesting period completed to the greater of the total vesting period or the original vesting period of the share-based payment transaction. The balance is recognised as remuneration cost for post-combination service.

 2.26. Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations

 Pursuant to IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, assets and liabilities of affiliates that are held for sale are presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position. Depreciation of assets ceases from the date of classification in “Non-current assets held for sale”. Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

 A discontinued operation is a component of the Group for which cash flows are independent. It represents a major line of business or geographical area of operations which has been disposed of or is currently being held for sale. If the Group reports discontinuing operations, net income from discontinued operations is presented separately on the face of the statement of income. Therefore, the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to the statement of income only refer to continuing operations.

 2.27. Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty

 In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described above, the Board of Managers of the Company is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not clear from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

 The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.


-----

###### 2.27.1. Critical accounting judgements

 The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are presented separately below), that the Board of Managers of the Company has made in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.

 - Revenue recognition

 Judgement and estimates are made for (i) the identification of the separable elements of a packaged offer and allocation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each element; (ii) the period of deferred revenues related to costs to access the service based on the type of product and the term of the contract; and (iii) presentation as net or gross revenues depending on whether the Group is acting as agent or principal.

 2.27.2. Key sources of estimation uncertainty

 The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.

 - Litigations

 In estimating the likelihood of outcome of claims filed against the Group and its investees and the estimated provision, the Group companies rely on the opinion of internal and/or external counsel. These estimates are based on the counsel’s best professional judgment, considering the stage of proceedings and historical precedents in respect of the different issues. Since the outcome of the claims will be determined via settlement or court’s decision, the results could differ from these estimates.

 - Post-employment benefits

 The liability in respect of post-employment defined benefit plans is determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about, among others, discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to uncertainty.

 - Fair value of financial instruments Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3

 Fair value is determined by reference to the market price at the end of the period, when the data is available. For financial instruments for which there is no active market such as interest rate swaps (which the Company currently may use to hedge its interest rate risk), call options and put options granted to non-controlling interests fair value is estimated based on models that rely on observable market data or using various valuation techniques, such as discounted future cash flows.

 - Deferred tax assets

 Deferred tax assets relate primarily to tax loss carried forwards and to deductible temporary differences between reported amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The assets relating to the tax loss carried forwards are recognised if it is probable that the Group will generate future taxable profits against which these tax losses can be set off. Evaluation of the Group’s capacity to utilize tax loss carried forward relies on significant judgment. The Group analyses past events, and the positive and negative elements of certain economic factors that may affect its business in the foreseeable future to determine the probability of its future utilization of these tax losses carried forward.

 - Intangible assets and Property, plant and equipment

 Estimates of useful lives are based on the effective obsolescence of fixed assets and the use made of these assets.

 - Impairment of intangible assets

 At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. The recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not available for use on the reporting date, are measured at least on an annual basis, irrespective of whether any impairment indicators exist.


-----

###### Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Board of Managers to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate to calculate present value. Where the actual future cash flows are less than expected, a material impairment loss may arise.

 - Impairment of contract assets and trade receivables

 For contract assets and trade receivables, the Group has applied the standard’s simplified approach and has calculated ECLs based on lifetime expected credit losses. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

 - Determination of the right-of-use and lease liabilities 

 The right-of-use and the lease liabilities are determined based on the lease term and the discount rate.

 • For the lease term, the Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
 • The discount rate is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.

 Scope of consolidation

 A full list of subsidiaries is included in note 33.

 3.1. Acquisitions and disposals in the current period

 3.1.1. Sale of a 25% equity stake in OMTEL 

 On January 2, 2020, Altice Europe announced the sale of the 25% equity interest held by PT Portugal in Belmont Infra Holding S.A. (“Belmont”), that owns 100% of a tower company OMTEL, to Cellnex Telecom S.A.. Total cash proceeds amounted to €201.0 million. The total capital gain recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to €101.0 million (please refer to note 4.3.2.2).

 The sale by PT Portugal of its 25% equity interest in Belmont is part of a larger transaction pursuant to which Cellnex Telecom S.A. acquired 100% of the share capital of OMTEL. In September 2018, at the time of its sale of OMTEL to a consortium including Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and Horizon Equity Partners, PT Portugal had reinvested €108.8 million for a 25% equity interest in OMTEL.

 3.1.2. Closing of the partnership with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and the sale of 49.99% interest in FastFiber (formerly known as Altice Portugal FTTH)

 On December 12, 2019, PT Portugal entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners regarding the sale of a 49.99% interest in the Portuguese fibre business to be carved-out into a dedicated wholesale vehicle, FastFiber (formerly known as Altice Portugal FTTH), comprising of the fibre passive infrastructure assets and rights, related contracts and underlying agreements, thereby creating a nationwide fibre wholesaler in Portugal. On April 17, 2020, the transaction was closed and the Group received €1,576.0 million of proceeds from this transaction, for the sale of 49.99% of the share capital of FastFiber (€773.3 million) and for the sale of 49.99% of the existing intercompany loan (€799.8 million), which was simultaneously converted into mandatory convertible notes (please refer to note 9.7.5). The proceeds from the transaction were partly used to further deleverage the Group’s debt (please refer to note 9.2). Furthermore, the Group recorded a receivable representing the net present value of an earnout of €375 million due December 2021. A second earnout is due in December 2026 subject to some performance conditions and the Company did not take into consideration this second earnout in the valuation of the purchase price and thus the capital gain recognized at closing of the transaction. Following the closing of the transaction, PT Portugal continues to control and fully consolidate FastFiber. The transaction resulted in the recognition of a non-controlling interest of


-----

###### €4.0 million (please refer to note 3.4) and a gain of €1,111.5 million in equity.

 FastFiber sells wholesale services to all operators at the same financial terms. MEO sells technical services to FastFiber for the construction, the subscriber connection and the maintenance of its fibre network.

 3.2. Acquisitions and disposals in the prior period

 3.2.1. Change in consolidation method in PHI

 In January 2019, HOT Mobile and Partner signed an amendment to the Network Sharing Agreement with respect to the governance of the company PHI, effective on January 1, 2019. Following this amendment, the parties have joint control over PHI (compared to significant influence before the amendment); accordingly, PHI is accounted under the provisions of IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements as joint operation (recognition of HOT Mobile's interests of 50% in PHI's assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses) instead of equity method. 

 3.2.2. Sale of SIRESP by PT Portugal

 At the end of June 2019, PT Portugal entered into an agreement with the Portuguese State to transfer the ownership of its shares in SIRESP’s share capital in December 2019. The transfer of ownership was completed on December 1, 2019. The capital gain recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to €1.4 million. The proceeds received amounted to €6.0 million.

 3.3. Other significant events

 3.3.1. Agreement on recommended all-cash offer for all common shares A and common shares B in the capital of Altice Europe by Next Private B.V

 On September 11, 2020, Altice Europe and Next Private B.V. (the “Offeror”), a direct subsidiary of Next Alt, jointly announced that a conditional agreement had been reached on a recommended public offer (the “Offer”) to be made by the Offeror for all common shares A and common shares B in the capital of Altice Europe for €4.11 in cash per share (cum dividend). This represented a total consideration of approximately €2.5 billion. On November 24, 2020, the Offer was launched. On December 16, 2020, the offer price was increased to €5.35 in cash per share (cum dividend). Please refer to note 32.2 for developments subsequent to the balance sheet date.

 3.4. Variations in non-controlling interests

 The variations in non-controlling interests are presented in the table below:

**Variations in non-controlling interests** **Altice Technical** **Other** **Group**

**Closing at December 31, 2020** **(34.8)** **14.7** **(20.1)**

###### The change in non-controlling interests (“NCI”) as at December 31, 2020 was mainly due to:

 • acquisition of the minority interest in Teads, reducing NCI by €14.4 million;

 • gain for the period increasing NCI by €12.6 million; and

 • dividends paid, mainly by subsidiaries of Altice Technical Services, reducing NCI by €8.5 million.

###### 3.5. Assets held for sale

 During 2018, PT Portugal classified real estate properties as held for sale with a book value of €15.9 million as at December 31, 2018, following the signature of promise of sale agreements entered with the entity Almost Future, S.A., for a total consideration of €17.7 million. As of December 31, 2019, the real estate deeds were not yet entered into, and the assets were not derecognised. The book value of the assets held for sale as at December 31, 2019 was €9.3 million. 

 On January 2, 2020, Altice Europe announced the sale of the 25% equity interest held by PT Portugal in Belmont, that owns 100% in a tower company OMTEL, to Cellnex Telecom S.A..

###### Segment reporting

 4.1. Definition of segments

 Given the geographical spread of the entities within the Group, analysis by geographical area is fundamental in determining the Group’s strategy and managing its different businesses. The Group’s chief operating decision maker is the Board of Managers. The Board of Managers analyses the Group’s results across geographies, and certain key areas by activity. The presentation of the segments here is consistent with the reporting used internally by the Board of Managers to track the Group’s operational and financial performance. The businesses that the Group owns and operates do not show significant seasonality, except for the mobile residential and business services, which can show significant changes in sales at year end and at the end of the summer season (the “back to school” period). The business services are also impacted by the timing of preparation of the annual budgets of public and private sector companies. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies.

 The segments that are presented are detailed below:

 4.2. Financial Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”)

 The Board of Managers has defined certain financial KPIs that are tracked and reported by each operating segment every month to the senior executives of the Company. The Board of Managers believes that these indicators offer them the best view of the operational and financial efficiency of each segment and this follows best practices in the rest of the industry, thus providing investors and other analysts a suitable base to perform their analysis of the Group’s results.


-----

###### The financial KPIs tracked by the Board of Managers are:

 • Revenues: by segment and in terms of activity;
 • Adjusted EBITDA: by segment;
 • Capital expenditure (“Capex”): by segment; and
 • Operating free cash flow (“OpFCF”): by segment.

 4.2.1. Revenues

 Additional information on the revenue split is presented as follows:

 • Residential revenue
 o Fixed: revenues from fixed services to B2C customers;
 o Mobile: revenues from mobile services to B2C subscribers;
 o Equipment business to B2C subscribers;

 • Business services: revenues from B2B customers, wholesale and other revenues; and
 • Media: media revenues in Teads. 

 Intersegment revenues represented 0.1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 0.2% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 (€4.2 million compared to €3.9 million).

 4.2.2. Non-Gaap measures

 Adjusted EBITDA, Capex and OpFCF are non-GAAP measures. These measures are useful to readers of the consolidated financial statements as they provide a measure of operating results excluding certain items that the Group’s management believe are either outside of its recurring operating activities, or items that are non cash. Excluding such items enables trends in the Group’s operating results and cash flow generation to be more easily observable. The non-GAAP measures are used by the Group internally to manage and assess the results of its operations, make decisions with respect to investments and allocation of resources, and assess the performance of management personnel. Such performance measures are also the de facto metrics used by investors and other members of the financial community to value other companies operating in the same industry as the Group and thus are a basis for comparability between the Group and its peers. Moreover, the debt covenants of the Group are based on the Adjusted EBITDA and other associated metrics. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA used in the covenants has not changed with the adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases by the Group.

 4.2.2.1. Adjusted EBITDA

 Following the application of IFRS 16 Leases, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, other expenses and income (capital gains, non-recurring litigation, restructuring costs) and share- based expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IAS 17 Leases for operating leases). This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating income as the effects of depreciation, amortization and impairment, excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, do ultimately affect the operating results. Operating results presented in the consolidated financial statements are in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.

 4.2.2.2. Capex

 Capex is an important indicator to follow, as the profile varies greatly between activities:

 • The fixed business has fixed Capex requirements that are mainly discretionary (network, platforms, general),
 and variable capex requirements related to the connection of new customers and the purchase of Customer Premises Equipment (TV decoder, modem, etc.).

 • Mobile Capex is mainly driven by investment in new mobile sites, upgrade to new mobile technology and
 licenses to operate; once engaged and operational, there are limited further Capex requirements.

 • Other Capex is mainly related to costs incurred in acquiring content rights.


-----

###### 4.2.2.3. Operating free cash flow 

 OpFCF is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capex. This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating cash flow as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with IAS 7 Statement of Cashflows.

1 The increase in goodwill of Teads of €3.2 million as of December 31, 2019 related to the acquisition of Buzzeff by Teads on the first quarter
of 2019.

###### 5.1. Impairment of goodwill

 The Group has identified its GCGUs based on the geographies that it operates in. For more details on the GCGUs, please refer to notes 2.7 and 2.9.

 Goodwill is tested at the level of each GCGU or CGU annually for impairment and whenever changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill was tested at the CGU/GCGU level for impairment as of December 31, 2020. The CGU/GCGU is at the country level where the subsidiaries operate. The recoverable amounts of the GCGUs are determined based on their value in use. The Group determined value in use for purposes of its impairment testing and, accordingly, did not determine the fair value less cost of disposal of the GCGUs. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are primarily the pre-tax discount rates, the terminal growth rate, revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures. Following the application of IFRS 16 Leases, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, other expenses and incomes (capital gains, non- recurring litigation, restructuring costs) and share-based expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IAS 17 Leases for operating lease).

 The Board of Managers and the Group’s senior executives have determined that there have not been any changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. In addition, there were no significant changes in assets or liabilities in any CGU/GCGU, while the recoverable amounts continue to significantly


-----

###### exceed the carrying amounts. Therefore, based on the annual impairment test performed as at December 31, 2020, no impairment of goodwill was recorded.

 5.1.1. Key assumptions used in impairment testing

 The Group has made use of various external indicators and internal reporting tools to assess and estimate the key assumptions used in the Group’s impairment testing for the year ended December 31, 2020.

 5.1.1.1. Cash flows

 The value in use of each GCGU was determined by estimating cash flows for a period of five years for the operating activities. Cash flow forecasts are derived from the most recent business plans approved by the Board of Managers. Beyond the specifically forecasted period of five years, the Company extrapolates cash flows for the remaining years based on an estimated constant growth rate between 1.0% - 4.0%. The growth rate is estimated at an individual GCGU level and does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.

 5.1.1.2. Discount rates

 Discount rates have been estimated using pre-tax rates, which reflect current market rates for investments of similar risk. The discount rate for the GCGUs was estimated using the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) of companies that operate a portfolio of assets similar to the Group’s. The pre-tax discount rate used across the Group for the calculation of the value in use at December 31, 2020 ranges from 7.9% to 14.4%.

 5.1.1.3. Other internal assumptions

 The Groups makes assumptions of customer churn rates and operating income, or Adjusted EBITDA (and the Adjusted EBITDA margin). These assumptions were based on historical experience and expectations of future changes in the market. The Group also assumes that recurring capex is expected to be proportional to sales, related to the acquisition of new clients, and thus is indexed to the growth in revenues.

 5.1.1.4. Assumptions about external factors

 In addition to using internal indicators to assess the carrying amount in use, the Board of Managers also relies on external factors which can influence the cash generating capacity of the CGUs or GCGUs and indicate that certain factors beyond the control of the Board of Managers might influence the carrying amounts in use:

 • Indicators of market slowdown in a country of operation,

 • Indicators of degradation in financial markets, that can impact the financing ability of the Group.

Pre-tax discount rate (%) 8.0% 8.8% 14.3% 12.8%

Post-tax discount rate (WACC) (%) 6.0% 7.0% 11.5% 10.0%

###### 5.1.2. Sensitivity analysis

 In validating the value in use determined for the GCGU, key assumptions used in the discounted cash-flow model were subject to a sensitivity analysis to test the resilience of value in use. The sensitivity analysis of the GCGUs is presented below, given changes to the material inputs to the respective valuations:


-----

**Sensitivity to changes in key inputs in the value in use calculation**

Post-tax discount rate (WACC) for which recoverable amount is equal 8.1% 9.1% 16.7% 67.1%

Adjusted EBITDA ratio for which recoverable amount is equal to 30.4% 33.9% 36.8% 12.9%
carrying amount

0.5% increase in the post-tax discount rate (WACC) (761.7) (134.2) (95.3) (149.3)

1.0% decrease in the terminal growth rate (1,146.2) (221.0) (146.3) (205.6)

###### The analysis did not result in any scenarios whereby a reasonable possible change in the EBITDA margin would result in a recoverable amount for the GCGU which is inferior to the carrying value, if applied to any other GCGU.

 5.2. Business combinations 

 The Group has not concluded any material acquisition during the past 12 months. When the Group acquires an entity, it records the provisional value of the assets and liabilities as being equivalent to the book values in the accounting records of the entity being acquired. The Group then identifies the assets and liabilities to which the purchase price needs to be allocated. The fair value is determined by an independent external appraiser based on a business plan prepared as of the date of the acquisition.

###### The decrease in net book value of intangible assets compared to 2019 was caused mainly by amortization of customer relations. The total amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was €364.2 million and €393.7 million, respectively, please refer to note 25. 

 The majority of intangible assets are related to the recognition of intangible assets on acquisition of business combinations as a reduction in the value of attributable goodwill. The key items include:

 • Customer relations: these assets are valued using the excess earnings method upon acquisition and subsequently amortized based on the local churn rate. The carrying amount of customer relations by segment was: (i) Portugal: €384.5 million (2019: €533.4 million), (ii) Israel: €44.8 million (2019: €72.3 million), (iii) Teads: €0.4 million, and (iv) the Dominican Republic: €0.4 million.

 • Brand name: the carrying amounts of the Group’s main brand names includes: (i) MEO in Portugal: €26.1 million, (ii) HOT in Israel: €4.5 million, and (iii) Teads: €8.0 million. 

 • Content rights: corresponds mainly to content right in Israel as HOT co-develops and co-owns high-quality original local content together with local producers and broadcasts it on HOT proprietary channels. The content rights were capitalized in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets and are amortized over their respective useful lives. When useful lives extend beyond one year, the nominal cash flows are discounted to their present value on initial recognition of the asset. The amortization related to content rights recorded for local production and fiction in Israel for the year ended December 31, 2020 was €38.9 million (average useful life is 3 years).

All derivatives are measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date. The total asset position as of December 31, 2020 was €78.1 million (2019: €107.6 million) and the decrease was mainly caused by restructuring of swaps in Altice Financing S.A. (“Altice Financing”).

(“Altice Holdings”) (€312.7 million) granted to entities within the Altice Group (mainly Altice Group Lux S.à r.l. (“Altice Group Lux”), Altice Luxembourg and Altice Corporate Financing S.à r.l. (“Altice Corporate Financing”)).

 Advances paid to Group companies included in investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020 largely related to a payment of €527.0 million upstreamed by Altice Financing to Altice Luxembourg and €627.4 million and €340.6 million upstreamed by the Company to respectively Altice Group Lux and Altice Corporate Financing. These payments were partially offset by proceeds from repayment of advances to Group companies included in investing activities of €520.1 million, €81.0 million and €43.8 million which the Company received from respectively Altice CVC Lux S.à r.l. (“Altice CVC Lux”), Altice Group Lux and Altice Luxembourg.

 10.1.4. Equity instrument at fair value through OCI

 As of December 31, 2020, the Group recorded €5.8 million of investments in Partner Co. Ltd (please refer to note 19.1.1). These investments in equity instruments are not held for trading.

 The decrease in other financial assets as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 is due to a reduction in accrued interest on loans to entities within the Altice Group.

The Group records provision for expected credit losses based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

For business services, the top 20 clients of the Group represent less than 5% of total Group revenues.

###### 16.1. Details of the significant defined benefit plans

 16.1.1. Portugal

 PT Portugal sponsors defined benefit plans, under which it is responsible for the payment of pension supplements to retired employees and healthcare services to retired employees and eligible relatives. In addition, PT Portugal and some of its subsidiaries are also responsible for the payment of salaries to suspended and pre-retired employees until


-----

###### retirement age. A detailed nature of these benefits is presented below:

 • Pension supplements - Retirees and employees of Companhia Portuguesa Rádio Marconi, S.A. (“Marconi”, a company merged into PT Portugal in 2002) hired prior to February 1, 1998 and retirees and employees of Telefones de Lisboa e Porto, S.A. (“TLP”, a company merged into PT in 1994) and Teledifusora de Portugal, S.A. (“TDP”, a company merged into PT in 1994) hired prior to June 23, 1994 are entitled to receive a supplemental pension benefit, which complements the pension paid by the Portuguese social security system. In addition, on retirement, PT Portugal pays a lump sum gratuity of a fixed amount which depends on the length of service completed by the employee and its salary. Employees hired by PT Portugal or any of its predecessor companies after the dates indicated above are not entitled to these benefits and are thus covered only by the general Portuguese Government social security system, which is a defined contribution plan in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.

 • Healthcare benefits - PT Portugal sponsors the payment of post-retirement health care benefits to certain suspended employees, pre-retired employees and retired employees and their eligible relatives. Health care services are rendered by Altice - Associação de Cuidados de Saúde (“Altice ACS”), which was incorporated with the only purpose of managing this Health Care Plan. This plan, sponsored by MEO, includes all employees hired by MEO until December 31, 2000 and by Marconi until February 1, 1998. The financing of the Health Care Plan comprises defined contributions made by participants to Altice ACS and the remainder by MEO, which incorporated an autonomous fund in 2004 for this purpose.

 • Salaries to suspended and pre-retired employees - PT Portugal and some of its subsidiaries are also responsible for the payment of salaries to suspended and pre-retired employees until the retirement age, which result from agreements between both parties. These liabilities are not subject to any legal funding requirement and therefore the monthly payment of salaries is made directly by each of the subsidiaries of PT Portugal.

 16.1.2. Israel

 In Israel, the plans are normally financed by contributions to insurance companies and classified as defined contribution plans or as defined benefit plans. The Group has defined contribution plans pursuant to Section 14 of the Severance Pay Law under which the Group pays regular contributions and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient amounts to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. In addition, the Group has a defined benefit plan in respect of severance pay pursuant to the Severance Pay Law. According to the law, employees are entitled to receive severance pay upon dismissal or retirement. In respect of its severance pay obligation to certain of its employees, the Group makes current deposits in pension funds and insurance companies (the “plan assets"). Plan assets comprise assets held by a long-term employee benefit fund or qualifying insurance policies. Plan assets are not available to the Group’s own creditors and cannot be returned directly to the Group.

 17.3. Covenants

 The debt issued by the subsidiaries of the Company is subject to certain restrictive covenants, which apply in the case of debt issued by Altice Financing and Altice Finco, to the Company and its restricted subsidiaries.

 Other than the revolving credit facilities, described below, such debt issued by the Company’s subsidiaries is subject to incurrence based covenants, which do not require ongoing compliance with financial ratios, but place certain limitations on the relevant restricted group’s ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional debt (including to finance new acquisitions), create liens, pay dividends and other distributions to shareholders or prepay subordinated indebtedness, make investments, sell assets, engage in affiliate transactions or engage in mergers or


-----

###### consolidations. These covenants are subject to several important exceptions and qualifications. 

 To be able to incur additional debt under an applicable debt instrument, the relevant restricted group must either meet the ratio test described below (on a pro forma basis for any contemplated transaction giving rise to the debt incurrence) or have available capacity under the general debt basket described below or meet certain other exceptions to the limitation on indebtedness covenant in such debt instrument. 

 Senior Secured Debt and Senior Debt is subject to an incurrence test as follows: 

 • Senior Secured debt of the Company is subject to an incurrence test of 3:1 (Adjusted EBITDA to Net Senior Secured Debt) and Senior Debt is subject to an incurrence test of 4:1 (Adjusted EBITDA to Net Total Debt). 

 The Company or its relevant subsidiaries are allowed to fully consolidate the EBITDA from any subsidiaries in which they have a controlling interest and that are contained in the restricted group as defined in the relevant debt instruments. 

 The Group has access to various Revolving Credit Facilities, which are subject to maintenance covenants in addition to the incurrence covenants described above. 

 Revolving Credit Facilities are subject to a maintenance test as follows: 

 • Revolving Credit Facilities of the Company are subject to a maintenance test of 5.25:1 (Adjusted EBITDA to Net Total Debt) if outstanding at the end of the quarter. 

 For details of the Revolving Credit Facilities, please refer to note 17.7. As at December 31, 2020, nil was drawn and no maintenance test was required to be performed at the level of the Company.

 The Group was in compliance with all the covenants described above, as of December 31, 2020.

 17.4. Derivatives financial instruments

 As part of its financial risk management strategy, the Group enters certain hedging operations. The main instruments used are fixed to fixed or fixed to floating cross-currency and interest rate swaps (“CCIRS”) that cover against foreign currency and interest rate risk related to the Group’s debt obligations. The Group applies hedge accounting for the operations that meet the eligibility criteria as defined by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

 17.4.1. Designation of derivative financial instruments

 17.4.1.1.Hedged instruments

 The Group continues to apply hedge accounting for those historical hedging operations that met the eligibility criteria as defined by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Where subsidiaries of the Group have issued debt in a currency that is different to the functional currency of the subsidiary, for example, issuing USD denominated debt in its European subsidiaries, the Group has entered into CCIRS to mitigate risks arising from the variations in foreign exchange rates. These instruments secure future cash flows in the subsidiaries functional currency and they are designated as cash flow hedges by the Group. As from 2019, hedge accounting is not applied to new CCIRS that mitigate risks arising from the variations in foreign exchange rates.

 17.4.1.2.Instruments not eligible for hedge accounting

 Those derivatives not designated in a cash flow hedge relationship are classified as derivative financial instruments recognised at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); the change in fair value of these derivatives is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

 17.4.2. Characteristics of the Group’s derivatives

The non-current portion of other financial liabilities amounts to €1,839.1 million as at December 31, 2020, an increase of €308.6 million compared to December 31, 2019. Details of the main items within the caption, and the movements from the prior period, are detailed below. 

 17.8.1. Lease liabilities

 Leases relate to the current and non-current lease liabilities recorded in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases, which standard was adopted as from January 1, 2019. Please also refer to note 20.

 17.8.2. Reverse factoring

 Through the use of reverse factoring structures, the Group extends its payment terms up to 360 days, reducing its requirements for working capital. The contractual arrangements in place permit the supplier to obtain the amounts invoiced at agreed payment term with the amounts paid by the banks that participate in the reverse factoring structure. The Group will repay the banks the full invoice amount, with interest, on the scheduled payment date as required by


-----

###### the reverse factoring agreement. Based on the scheduled payment dates, the amounts payable under this arrangement are accounted for as current liabilities. As the amounts are payable to the participating banks, the amounts have been presented under Other financial liabilities. In the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the cash flows related to reverse factoring are presented under Changes in working capital or Payments to acquire tangible and intangible assets depending on the nature of the expenditure, and Payments made to suppliers through factoring arrangements or Payments made to factoring companies relating to the net payment to the banks. The decrease in reverse factoring as at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 is due to the combination of timing of reverse factoring capacity with the banks.

 17.8.3. Accrued interest

 Accrued interest is the amount of interest due at balance sheet date regarding the Company’s outstanding debentures and loans from financial institutions.

 17.8.4. Put options with non-controlling interests 

 The Group executes agreements with the non-controlling interests in certain acquisitions whereby the non-controlling interests have the option to sell their non-controlling interests to the Group. These instruments are measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date (please refer to note 19.1.2.3 for further information). 

 17.8.5. Mandatory Convertible Notes

 On April 17, 2020, PT Portugal and Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners entered into a subscription agreement regarding the issuance and subscription of €1,600.0 million mandatory convertible notes in which the parties subscribed considering the percentage of interest in equity of FastFiber. The €848.8 million relates to the financial liability of the Group towards Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners, consisting of the notional amount of €799.8 million and an additional subscription of €49.0 million. The notes will bear interest on their aggregate principal amount at the fixed rate of 6.00% per annum. Interest is due in May and November of each year. At any time on or after the date that is twenty years after the date of issue, all or part of the notes issued can be converted into shares with mutual consent. The principle of the convertible notes do not have a stated maturity and will never become payable in cash.

 17.8.6. Mandatory Convertible Notes Altice Luxembourg

 The Mandatory Convertible Notes (“MCN”) were issued for an aggregate amount of €2,055 million, which were entirely subscribed by the Company’s sole shareholder, Altice Luxembourg. These instruments are compound financial instruments that contain both a liability and an equity component. On December 30, 2020, the existing agreement was amended with a revised maturity date of December 31, 2023 and an interest rate which is based on the annual interest rate accrued on the Company’s Senior Debt. Following the amended agreement, the existing liability was derecognized and a new liability was recorded, resulting in the recognition of an interest expense of €17.9 million and an extinguishment of debt of €478.3 million. The non-current portion of the MCN liability recorded at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are €174.0 million and €489.9 million respectively. The current portion of the MCN liability recorded at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are €180.0 million and €139.9 million respectively.

###### Financial risk factors

 In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to several financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk (including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) and other risks, including equity price risk. This note presents the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its financial risk and capital.

 Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. The Board of Managers establishes the Group’s financial policies and the executive management establishes objectives in line with these policies.

 The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

 18.1. Credit risk

 Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers. The credit risk may arise from the exposures of commitments under a number of financial instruments with one body or as the result of commitments with a number of groups of debtors with similar economic characteristics, whose ability to meet their commitments could be similarly affected by economic or other changes.

 The Group accounting for impairment losses for financial assets is based on a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. IFRS 9 requires the Group to record an allowance for ECLs for all loans and other financial assets not held at FVTPL. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive. The shortfall is then discounted at an approximation to the asset’s original effective interest rate.

 For contract assets, trade and other receivables, the Group has applied the standard’s simplified approach and has calculated ECLs based on lifetime expected credit losses. The Group records expected credit losses based on the


-----

###### Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. 

 The Group’s income mainly derives from customers in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic. The Group regularly monitors its customers’ debts and expected credit losses are recorded in the consolidated financial statements, which provide a fair value of the loss that is inherent to debts whose collection lies in doubt. Additionally, retail customers represent a major portion of revenues and these clients generally pay in advance for the services they buy, or in more significant regions, retail customers generally pay using direct debit, a practice that reduces the Group’s credit risk. The expected credit losses on the financial assets of €2,769.7 million is deemed not material. Please also refer to note 10 for Financial assets and note 12 for Trade and other receivables.

 18.2. Liquidity risk

 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s objective when managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

 Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Managers, which manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserves borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

 The Group has a strong track record of driving operating free cash flow generation and specializes in turning around struggling businesses and optimizing the cash generation of existing businesses. As all external debt is issued and managed centrally, executive Directors of the Group have a significant amount of control and visibility over the payments required to satisfy obligations under the different external debts. Additionally, the Group has access to undrawn revolving credit facilities for an aggregate amount of €538.0 to cover liquidity needs not met by operating cash flow generation.

 Management expects the available cash on hand, the revolving credit facilities available and the Group’s cash flows to be sufficient to meet all contractual obligations.

 Please refer to note 17.10 regarding the maturity of financial liabilities.

 18.3. Market risks

 The Group is exposed to risk from movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and market prices that affect its assets, liabilities and anticipated future transactions.

 18.3.1. Interest rate risk

 Interest rate risk comprises the interest price risk that results from borrowings at fixed rates and the interest cash flow risk that results from borrowings at variable rates.

 The Company has an exposure to changes of interest rate in the market, deriving from long-term loans that have been received and which bear variable rate interest.

**Interest structure of non-current financial debt** **December 31,** **December 31,**

**(€m)** **2020** **2019**

Financial debt at fixed rates 8,500.7 8,871.0

Financial debt at variable rates 1,718.7 1,863.0

**Total** **10,219.4** **10,734.0**

###### The Group’s proportion of variable rate debt decreased from 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 16.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to a decrease in the total debt and financial debt at variable rates. When it can, the Group endeavours to issue fixed rate debt (which also typically offers longer maturities).

 The Group has entered into different hedging contracts to manage interest rate risk related to debt instruments with variable interest rates. Please see note 17.4 for more information.

 A sensitivity analysis was performed on the impact of an increase of interest rates applicable to floating rate debt: a Euribor/Libor rate increase by 1 percentage point would result in an additional annual interest expense of €9.0 million.


-----

###### 18.3.2. Foreign currency risk

 The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk from transactions and translation. Transactional exposures are managed within a prudent and systematic hedging policy in accordance with the Company’s specific business needs. Translation exposure arises from the consolidation of the financial statements of foreign operations in euros, which is, in principle, not hedged. The Group’s objective is to manage its foreign currency exposure using currency forwards, futures and swaps.

 The Group estimates that a 10% variation of foreign currencies against euro parity is a relevant change of variables and reasonably possible risk in any given year. The table below provides the assessment of the impact of a 10% change in foreign currencies against euro on net result and reserves.

**Sensitivity to variations in exchange rates** **December 31, 2020**

**(€m)** **Israeli Shekel** **Dominican Peso** **Total**

**Profit for the year**

**Equity**

Increase of 10% in exchange rate (85.1) (27.5) **(112.6)**

Decrease of 10% in exchange rate 85.1 27.5 **112.6**

###### Exchange differences recorded in the income statement amounted to a gain of €113.1 million (2019: exchange gain of €33.9 million).

 Additionally, the Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on the different debt instruments that it has issued over time. 

 The Group has issued a portion of its debt in US dollar, which is partially hedged to manage associated currency exchange risk. Debt which is denominated in US dollar and which is not hedged against foreign currency risk amounted to nil as at December 31, 2020 and €1,411.0 million as at December 31, 2019. A reconciliation between the nominal amount of the total debt measured at its balance sheet rate and the swap adjusted debt is presented in note 17.5.

 18.3.3. Price risk

 The Group has an investment in Partner Co. Ltd., whose shares are listed and which is classified as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss. The Group is exposed to risk of fluctuations in the security price that is determined by reference to the quoted market price. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of the investment in Partner Co. Ltd. amounted to €5.8 million (€5.1 million as of December 31, 2019). Management considers the price risk of the investment in Partner Co. Ltd. to be limited.

###### 19.1.2. Information on valuation techniques

 19.1.2.1. Investments in listed entities 

 Quoted prices directly available from an active market are used to source the fair value, i.e. the quoted share price of the listed investments in Partner Co. These valuations are directly observable in an open market and therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

 19.1.2.2. Derivative financial instruments 

 Future cash flows are estimated using market observable data at the end of the reporting period (namely, forward exchange rates and interest rates) and the contracted rates of the derivative discounted at a rate that reflects the counterparty credit risk. Since model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgement, the Company has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

 19.1.2.3. Put options

 Each contract has specific terms and conditions, and the valuation is performed using the contracted terms and assessment against market comparable information where appropriate. For example, the exercise price in the option may be determined based on an EBITDA multiple minus the net financial debt. In all instances, the probabilities of the option being exercised is determined using management’s best estimate and judgement. The resulting fair value is discounted using appropriate discount rates of the related funding pool. These models use a variety of inputs that use judgements not able to be verified externally, therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

 19.1.2.4. Call options 

 The valuation is derived by calculating the intrinsic value, being the difference in the value of the underlying asset and the options exercise price, and time value of the option, which accounts for the passage of time until the option expires. Various inputs are used, including the price of the underlying asset and its volatility, the strike price and maturity in the contract, and the risk-free rate and dividend yield. The model calculates the possible prices of the underlying asset and their respective probability of occurrence, given these inputs. These models use a variety of inputs that use judgements not able to be verified externally, therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

 19.2. Level 3 instruments 

 19.2.1. Assumptions with management judgement used in fair value measurement 

 The instruments in Level 3 are the put and call options with the non-controlling interests in acquired entities. The valuation methods used to determine the fair value of these instruments include certain inputs that do not use publicly available information and therefore require management’s judgement. Those with significant impact on the fair value of the instruments concerned are deemed to be categorized as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Further details on these valuation methods and the associated inputs using judgements and which can have a significant impact on the fair value are presented below.

**Net operating losses and tax carry forward, net** **0.6** **.3**

###### Net operating losses (“NOLs”) and tax carry forward as of December 31, 2020 were related mainly to holding companies as well as PT Portugal. The Group does not believe that the unrecognised deferred tax losses can be used given the Group’s current structure, but the Group will continue exploring opportunities to offset these against any future profits that the Company or its subsidiaries may generate.

 Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Group's future deductible temporary differences and NOLs. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is probable that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating the recognition of deferred tax assets, management takes into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Group may be required to adjust its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income tax expense in the consolidated income statement. As of December 31, 2020, and as of December 31, 2019, the Group recognised deferred tax asset on the basis of projections of future use of the loss carry forward deemed probable.

 23.4. Current tax assets and liabilities

 As of December 31, 2020, current tax assets for €22.8 million correspond to the net income tax advances paid in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, current tax liabilities amount to €189.4 million and correspond to the net income tax payable


-----

###### for 2020. The current tax liabilities increased compared to €115.5 as of December 31, 2019, mainly due to the taxable profits generated by FastFiber in Portugal, entity that was incorporated in April 2020 (please refer to note 3.1.2).

 23.5. Tax litigation

 This note describes the new proceedings and developments in existing tax litigations that have occurred since the publication of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 and that have had or that may have a significant effect on the financial position of the Group.

 23.5.1. Portugal

 MEO estimated the probable tax contingencies arising from tax audits carried out by the Portuguese tax authorities on various Group companies and recognised the appropriate amount of provision in its accounts according to its risk assessment as of December 31, 2020. The provision covers risks related mainly to the potential return of tax credits/incentives and VAT on indemnities charged as result of the breach of loyalty contracts entered with post-paid customers. The VAT contingency relates to both the fixed and mobile businesses and covers years since 2012. The claim for the VAT of the mobile company in 2012 was being discussed in an arbitral court, which decided to send the matter to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), that issued a decision on November 22, 2018 which was not favourable to MEO, concluding that, under certain circumstances, indemnities should be charged with VAT, and at the same time referring that ultimately VAT should only be assessed based on indemnities received from customers. The tax assessments of the fixed-line company in 2012 and both the mobile and fixed-line companies in 2013 and 2014, were submitted to the arbitral court as well, and all were suspended and waited for the decision of the ECJ. Following the ECJ decision, MEO was notified of the arbitral court decisions on all actions relating to the fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014, all of which unfavourable and some referring that VAT should only be assessed based on indemnities received from customers, which is less than 20% of the overall indemnities invoiced. MEO appealed from all these decisions to the Administrative Central Court, the decisions of which are not yet know. For the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 MEO reached an agreement with the tax authorities resulting in the payment of approximately €3 million. For the following years, it is not certain that the tax authorities will accept similar agreements.

 23.5.2. Israel

 On July 4, 2019, HOT signed a compromise agreement with the Israeli tax authorities for an amount of €7.6 million related to tax assessment for the years 2015 and 2016.

 23.5.3. Other tax jurisdictions

 Tax assessments are conducted in several tax jurisdictions within the Group (Israel and Luxembourg). The provisions recorded in the consolidated financial statements are based on the assessment of the risk by the management's and its professional advisors.

###### The net finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased to €99.7 million compared to €372.4 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease is mainly explained by the net of the following items:
 • net gain on extinguishment of financial liabilities of €370.6 million (2019: loss of €9.6 million) related to the full redemption of the outstanding MCN (please refer to note 17.8.6) and redemptions of the Group’s notes in Altice Financing and Altice Finco (please refer to note 17.2);
 • realized and unrealized losses on derivative instruments of €229.5 million compared to gains of €146.6 million in 2019 due to higher losses in variation in the mark to market of the swaps of Altice Financing. Proceeds from the monetization of swaps in Altice Financing amounted to €50.2 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020 versus nil for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019;
 • net foreign exchange gains of €113.1 million compared to gains of €33.9 million in 2019 mainly due to the effect of the USD/EUR rate on USD denominated debt; 
 • lower interest relative to gross financial debt due to refinancing activities. Interest paid on debt including interest received from / paid on interest derivatives for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020 amounted to €468.7 million versus €606.0 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019; and
 • higher interest income due to higher loans receivable with entities in the wider Altice Group, mainly Altice Group Lux and Altice Luxembourg.

 This note describes the new proceedings and developments in existing litigations that have occurred since the publication of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2019 and that have had or that may have a significant effect on the financial position of the Group. 

 30.1. Portugal

 30.1.1. European Commission Investigation 

 After having approved the acquisition of PT Portugal by the Group on April 20, 2015, the European Commission initiated an investigation into infringement by Altice Europe of the obligation of prior notification of concentrations under Article 4(1) of the Merger Regulation and/or of the stand-still obligation laid down in Article 7(1) of the Merger Regulation. The European Commission issued a statement of objections on May 18, 2017, informing Altice Europe of the objections raised against it. 
 On April 24, 2018, the European Commission notified Altice Europe of its decision to impose upon it two fines totalling €124.5 million. The Commission found that Altice Europe infringed the prior notification obligation of a concentration under Article 4(1) of the EU Merger Regulation, and the stand-still obligation under Article 7(1) of the EU Merger Regulation. Altice Europe fully disagrees with the Commission's decision, and in particular, it considers that this case differs entirely from the French Numéricable/Altice France/Virgin gun jumping case, in which the Altice Group had agreed not to challenge the allegations brought against it. In Altice Europe’s opinion, the Commission's decision relies on a wrongful definition of the notion of "implementation" of a concentration. Further, the transaction agreement governing the management of the target during the pre-closing period provided Altice Europe with a consultation right on certain exceptional matters relating to PT Portugal aimed at preserving the value and integrity of the target prior to closing and was in accordance with well-established M&A market practice. 
 In any event, Altice Europe considers that the elements in the Commission's file do not establish the exercise of influence, as alleged by the Commission, by Altice Europe over PT Portugal's business conduct neither prior to the merger notification to the Commission nor prior to the Commission's clearance. 
 On July 5, 2018, Altice Europe filed an Application for annulment against the Commission's decision before the EU General Court to request that the decision as a whole be annulled or, at the very least, that the sanction be significantly reduced (Case T-425/18). The Commission's decision does not affect the approval granted by the European Commission on April 20, 2015 for the acquisition of PT Portugal by the Group. 
 On November 6, 2018, the Council of the European Union filed an Application to intervene in the case before the EU General Court. Both Altice Europe and the European Commission confirmed they had no observations to the Council’s Application to intervene. The Council requested an extension of the time-limit to file its Statement of intervention. The Court granted that extension until February 25, 2019. 
 On November 30, 2018, the European Commission filed its Defence requesting the Court (1) to dismiss Altice Europe’s Application and (2) to order Altice Europe to pay the costs. The said Defence was notified to Altice Europe on December 14, 2018. On December 20, 2018, Altice Europe requested an extension of one month to lodge its Reply. The extension was granted on January 4, 2019, until February 25, 2019. 
 On February 25, 2019, Altice Europe filed its Reply to the Commission’s Defence adhering to the conclusions and orders sought in its Application for annulment. 
 On March 15, 2019, Altice Europe filed its observations on the Statement of intervention of the Council of the European Union, which essentially mirror the corresponding allegations in Altice Europe’s Application and reply to the Commission’s defence. 
 On March 18, 2019, Altice Europe received the copy of the Commission’s observations on the Statement of intervention of the Council of the European Union, which merely state it does not have any observations, as its position and that of the Council of the European Union are aligned. 
 After an extension of the deadline, the Commission filed its Rejoinder to Altice Europe’s reply on May 10, 2019.


-----

###### The written phase of the procedure was closed. The President fixed a date on which the Judge-Rapporteur was to present a preliminary report to the General Court. 
 Altice Europe submitted a reasoned request for a hearing on May 29, 2019. 
 On March 10, 2020, Altice Europe received from the General Court an invitation addressed to all the parties to submit observations regarding the possible consequences of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) judgment on another case by March 25, 2020. On March 25, 2020, Altice Europe lodged its observations and reiterated its submission filed on May 29, 2019, regarding the importance of a hearing in the present case.
 On March 23, 2020, the Commission and the Council of the European Union lodged their observations, which have been transmitted to Altice Europe on March 31, 2020. In essence, the Commission and the Council concluded by reiterating that Altice Europe’s application should be rejected. 
 On June 3, 2020, Altice Europe received the decision from the General Court to open the oral part of the procedure. The hearing took place on September 24, 2020. On July 21, 2020, Altice Europe received the report for the hearing prepared by the Judge-Rapporteur summarizing the facts relied on and the arguments of each party and of the Council as the intervener. 
 On October 5, 2020, Altice Europe sent a letter to the General Court with some observations to respond to a question posed by the Judge Rapporteur during the Hearing. 
 On November 16, 2020, Altice Europe received the decision from the General Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure, to hear the other parties on Altice Europe’s observations and to request the Commission to produce certain documents.
 On December 10, 2020, Altice Europe received a copy of the Commission’s and the Council’s responses. It was invited by the General Court to submit any observations it might have on the Commission’s reply. On January 7, 2021, Altice Europe sent its observations to the Commission’s reply. On January 12, 2021, Altice Europe received the decision from the General Court to close the oral part of the procedure.
 Altice Europe would expect a judgment in the first half of 2021.
 As of December 31, 2020, a liability of €129.1 million (including accrued interest) is recorded at Altice Portugal, as it is the acquiring entity of PT Portugal. On July 25, 2018, the Altice Group issued a bank guarantee to the European Commission of €124.5 million (excluding accrued interest). 

 30.1.2. Vodafone – Network Sharing Agreement

 Vodafone and PT Comunicações (currently MEO) signed, on July 21, 2014, an agreement for the acquisition of exclusive rights of use of the PON Network, which consisted in the possibility of access to the installed infrastructure owned by each of the parties to offer new generation services and integrated offerings (voice, internet and television) autonomously in the retail market. On November 4, 2015, MEO informed Vodafone that it has decided to individually develop a new, ambitious plan for the expansion of its fibre optic network, both in geographical areas already covered by a new generation network and in other geographical areas, while continuing to comply with the agreed. Notwithstanding, Vodafone states that this was a breach of the agreement and is claiming an amount of approximately €132 million from MEO for damages and losses allegedly caused by that non-compliance with the agreed. 

 MEO submitted its defence to these claims in June 2018, stating that (i) Vodafone did not have a contractual right to prevent MEO from developing its network autonomously and independently from the agreement, (ii) all of Vodafone rights, resulting from the agreement, were respected by MEO, and Vodafone was in no way limited by MEO in the investment in the construction of its own network, which it developed freely and voluntarily, choosing to invest where it found greater profitability for its business, and (iii) Vodafone´s claims for damages and losses were not factually sustainable.

 A preliminary hearing took place in February 2019, following the Court asked experts to review information provided by Vodafone supporting its alleged damages and losses. The experts' report has been submitted to the Court, which in


-----

###### summary concludes that there are not enough elements allowing, with a certain level of reliability, to validate the amounts requested by Vodafone. At this stage, both parties are waiting for the Court to schedule the trial date.

 30.1.3. Optimus (currently NOS Comunicações) - Interconnection agreement

 This legal action is dated from 2001 and relates to the price that Telecomunicações Móveis Nacionais (“TMN”, PT Portugal’s mobile operation at that time) charged Optimus - Comunicações S.A. (“Optimus”, one of MEO’s mobile competitors at that time, currently NOS) for mobile interconnection services, price that Optimus did not agree with. TMN transferred to PT Comunicações (PT Portugal’s fixed operation at that time, currently named MEO) the receivables from Optimus, and subsequently PT Comunicações offset those receivables with payables due to Optimus. NOS argues for the annulment of the offset made by PT Comunicações and accordingly claims from PT Comunicações the settlement of the payables due before the offset plus accrued interest. In August 2015, the Court decided that the transfer of the interconnection receivables from TMN to PT Comunicações and consequently the offset of those receivables with payables due by PT Comunicações to Optimus were not legal and therefore sentenced MEO to settle those payables plus interest up to date in the total amount of approximately €35 million. MEO appealed this decision in October 2015 to the Court of Appeal of Lisbon. In September 2016, MEO was notified of the decision from the Court of Appeal of Lisbon, which confirmed the initial ruling against MEO, as a result of which MEO decided to appeal to the Supreme Court. On March 13, 2017, MEO was notified of the Supreme Court’s decision of dismissal of its appeal and as a result MEO decided to appeal to the Constitutional Court. In January 8, 2018, MEO was notified of the Constitutional Court decision of dismissal of the appeal, after which MEO appealed to the Constitutional Court Conference. MEO was notified that the Constitutional Court Conference did not accept and consequently will not analyse the appeal. In July 2018, MEO paid €41 million to settle the action which had been accrued for in 2015.

 NOS claimed an additional amount of interests during the judicial procedure and is now claiming an additional payment of €5 million. The contestation of the legal action by MEO was submitted in February 2019. On May 8, 2020, MEO received the first instance sentence that totally absolves MEO of the request by NOS. NOS appealed to Higher Court that decided, on January 15, 2021, to condemn MEO in the total amount requested by NOS. MEO will appeal to the Supreme Court. 

 30.1.4. Anacom litigation

 MEO has several outstanding proceedings filed from Anacom, for some of which MEO has not yet received formal condemnations. This litigation includes matters such as the violation of rules relating to portability, TDT, the non- compliance of obligations under the universal service (public phones) and regulated offers (ORAC). Historically, MEO paid amounts significantly lower than the administrative fines set by Anacom in final decisions. The initial value of the proceedings is normally set at the maximum applicable amount of the administrative fine until the final decision is formally issued. 

 30.1.5. Zon TV Cabo Portugal – Violation of portability rules

 Zon TV Cabo Portugal (currently NOS) claims that MEO has not complied with the applicable rules for the portability of fixed numbers, as a result of which claims for an indemnity of €22 million corresponding to profits lost due to unreasonable rejections and the delay in providing the portability of the number. An expert indicated by each party and a third-party expert evaluated this matter and presented the final report to the Court, which decided to change the scope of the work to be performed by the experts, and accordingly the action moved back again. The experts presented the new final report to the Court in January 2019 and the final Court hearing is scheduled in April, 2021.

 30.1.6. Municipal taxes and rights-of-way

 Pursuant to a statute enacted on August 1, 1997, as an operator of a basic telecommunications network, MEO was exempt from municipal taxes and rights-of-way and other fees with respect to its network in connection with its obligations under the Concession. The Portuguese Government has advised MEO in the past that this statute confirmed the tax exemption under MEO’s former Concession and that it will continue to take the necessary actions in order for MEO to maintain the economic benefits contemplated by the former Concession.

 Law 5/2004, dated 10 February 2004, established a new rights-of-way regime in Portugal whereby each municipality may establish a fee, up to a maximum of 0.25% of each wireline services bill, to be paid by the customers of those wireline operators which network infra-structures are located in each such municipality. Meanwhile, Decree-Law 123/2009, dated 21 May 2009, clarified that no other tax should be levied by the municipalities in addition to the tax established by Law 5/2004. This interpretation was confirmed by the Supreme Administrative Court of Portugal in


-----

###### several legal actions. Some municipalities continue to perceive that the Law 5/2004 does not expressly revoke other taxes that the municipalities wish to establish, because Law 5/2004 is not applicable to the public municipality domain. 

 Currently, there are legal actions with some municipalities regarding this matter and some of the municipalities have initiated enforcement proceedings against MEO to demand the payment of those taxes.

 30.1.7. National Commission for Data Protection

 MEO has several outstanding proceedings filed by the National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD), for some of which MEO has not yet received formal condemnations. This litigation includes matters such as the violation of rules relating to marketing contact with clients and alleged non-compliance of obligations under the database of debtors to telecom operators.

 Historically, MEO paid significantly lower (or even no amounts) of the administrative fines set by CNPD in final decisions. The initial value of the proceedings is normally set at the maximum applicable amount of the administrative fine until the final decision is formally issued. 

 30.1.8. Portuguese Competition Authority investigation

 On December 20, 2019, MEO has received a Statement of Objections from the Portuguese Competition Authority regarding its preliminary view that both MEO and NOWO, which operates as a MVNO using MEO’s network, were part of a cartel for market sharing and price fixing of mobile services, sold either on a standalone basis or in bundles of fixed and mobile telecommunications services. The Competition Authority concluded that this alleged illegal practice took place between 2017 and 2018. MEO firmly denies the existence of any cartel. 

 On February 19, 2020, MEO has submitted its written defence to the Statement of Objections, after which the Portuguese Competition Authority will decide whether to issue a condemnatory decision and in that case the amount of the fine. The decision to impose a fine will end the administrative procedure with MEO having the possibility of challenging this decision in court. 

 On 3 December 2020, the PCA notified MEO of its decision to impose upon it a fine of €84 million for market sharing and price fixing of mobile and fixed telecommunications services with NOWO. MEO fully disagrees with the PCA’s unexpected. On January 18, 2021, MEO filed a judicial appeal against the decision before the Competition, Supervision and Regulation Court to request the decision to be annulled and to be acquitted of all charges. The risk associated with this contingency was classified as possible and accordingly no provision was recorded as of December 31, 2020.

 30.1.9. Portuguese Competition Authority investigation – Google AdWords

 On July 16, 2020, the Portuguese Competition Authority issued a Statement of Objections regarding its preliminary view that MEO, NOS – Comunicações, S.A. NOWO – Communications, S.A. and Vodafone Portugal – Comunicações Pessoas, S.A. were part of an agreement in accordance with which all those entities would not bid for certain key Google AdWords of the other operators, which in accordance with the Competition Authority is similar to an agreement to indirectly fix the acquisition price of certain Google AdWords related to the retail telecommunications market. The Competition Authority concluded that telecommunications operators distorted competition of the Portuguese online search advertising, between 2010 and 2018 in the case of MEO. The maximum fine applicable for this kind of infraction corresponds to 10% of the entity’s turnover. 

 MEO submitted its written defense to the Statement of Objections on October 2, 2020 and will wait for the Portuguese Competition Authority decision. Due to the early stage of the process and little previous background in similar cases, management determined that it is difficult to reliably estimate the probability of the outcome of this case at this time, but it also believes that it is not more likely than not that an outflow of economic resources will be required with regards to this Statement of Objections from the Portuguese Competition Authority. As such, no provision was recognized as of December 31, 2020.

 30.2. Israel 

 30.2.1. Israel Consumer class action 

 In June 2014, a claim and a motion to approve it as class action was filed at the Central District Court against HOT- Telecommunication Systems Ltd. and HOT Telecom (together "HOT"). The claim is based on the allegation that HOT


-----

###### violated its licenses terms by failing to meet the required standards for response times in its call centers and by failing to operate the call centers during the entire working hours as required. In addition, the claimants argue that HOT did not comply with the Consumer Protection Regulations regarding the operation of a call back service in its call centers. The amount of the claim was estimated by the claimants at €10.3 million. On August 26, 2017, the Court certified the motion to approve the claim as class action based on the causes described above. Following the Court's decision, the parties submitted their statements of claim and defense and preliminary proceedings were conducted. At the recommendation of the Court, the parties agreed to conduct mediation proceedings. The mediation is still in progress and a provision was recorded as of December 31, 2020 based on management’s estimation after consulting with the company's external legal attorneys.

 Going concern

 As of December 31, 2020, the Group had net current liability position of €560.8 million (mainly due to trade payables amounting to €1,371.6 million) and a positive working capital of €163.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group registered a net profit of €417.8 million from continuing operations and generated cash flows of €1,476.6 million from continuing operations. 

 As at December 31, 2020, the Group had a equity position of €736.0 million compared to a negative equity position of €541.7 million as at December 31, 2019. The equity position increased from the prior period mainly due to comprehensive profit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the positive impact of transactions with non-controlling interests during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020. These positive impacts were partially offset by certain other transactions. 

 As of December 31, 2020, the Group’s short-term borrowings comprised mainly loans from lenders for Altice Financing of €17.8 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Group’s short-term borrowings amounted to €276.6 million. The short-term obligations are expected to be covered by the operating cash flows of the operating subsidiaries. As at December 31, 2020, the amount drawn on the revolving credit facilities at Altice Financing amounted to nil. A listing of available credit facilities is provided in note 17.7 and the amounts available are sufficient to cover the short-term debt and interest expense needs of each of these segments if needed. The expected interest payments for the 12 months period ending December 31, 2021 amount to approximately €311.3 million.

 Given the above, the Board of Managers has considered the following elements in determining that the use of the going concern assumption is appropriate:

 • The Group’s performance on Adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flows:
 Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to €1,579.5 million, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA of €1,548.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 were €1,476.6 million.
 • The Group had unrestricted cash reserves of €354.0 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to €395.3 million as of December 31, 2019, which would allow it to cover any urgent cash needs. The Group can move its cash from one segment to another under certain conditions as allowed by the covenants under its various debentures and loan agreements. Cash reserves in operating segments carrying debt obligations were as follows:
 : €354.0 million.
 • Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, the Group had access to revolving credit facilities of up to €538.0 million, of which nil was drawn as at December 31, 2020.

 The Group’s senior executives track operational key operating measures (KPIs) on a weekly basis, thus tracking top line trends closely. This allows the Group’s senior executives and local CEOs to ensure proper alignment with budget targets and respond with speed and flexibility to counter any unexpected events and help to ensure that the budgeted targets are met.

 On April 17, 2020, the Group closed the transaction to sell 49.99% interest in the Portuguese fibre business to Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners. On April 17, 2020, the Group received €1,573.1 million of proceeds from this transaction. 

 Regarding commitments, please refer to note 29 for more details. 

 On March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic, highlighting the health risks of the disease. The COVID-19 pandemic had a limited impact on consolidated


-----

###### financial statements of the Group as of December 31, 2020 and for the twelve month period then ended. Although the situation continues to evolve, the Company expects that the COVID19 pandemic will have limited effects on the Group’s operations and financial performance for future periods. 

 Management expects the available cash on hand at December 31, 2020 and the expected limited impact of COVID- 19 on the Group’s cash flows to be sufficient to continue the Group’s operations and to repay all contractual obligations that fall due in the next 12 months. Accordingly, the Board of Managers is of the view that the Group will continue to act as a going concern for 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements and has hence deemed it appropriate to prepare these consolidated financial statements using the going concern assumption.

 Events after the reporting period

 32.1. IBC acquisition Israel

 On September 15, 2020, HOT announced that it has taken a minority stake in IBC Israel Broadband (IBC). Post- closing, HOT will become an equal partner in the IBC Partnership (that holds 70% of IBC's share capital), together with Cellcom and Israel Infrastructure Fund (IIF) and HOT will hold indirectly 23.3% of IBC's share capital, through an investment in the company of €44.6 million, substantially equal to the investment made by each of Cellcom and IIF. There is an agreement between IBC and HOT, under which HOT undertakes to purchase an indefeasible right, or IRU, to use IBC's fibre-optic network. There is also a service agreement between IBC and HOT, under which IBC undertakes to purchase certain services from HOT. 

 The transaction was closed on February 11, 2021 following the regulatory and third-party approvals.

 32.2. Agreement on recommended all-cash offer for all common shares A and common shares B in the capital of Altice Europe by Next Private B.V

 On September 11, 2020, Altice Europe and Next Private B.V. (the “Offeror”), a direct subsidiary of Next Alt, jointly announced that a conditional agreement had been reached on a recommended public offer (the “Offer”) to be made by the Offeror for all common shares A and common shares B in the capital of Altice Europe for €4.11 in cash per share (cum dividend). This represented a total consideration of approximately €2.5 billion. On November 24, 2020, the Offer was launched. On December 16, 2020 the offer price was increased to €5.35 in cash per share (cum dividend). At the expiration of the Offer Period on January 21, 2021, the aggregate of shares tendered under the Offer and shares already held by the Offeror group represented approximately 95.11% of the number of listed shares of Altice Europe and approximately 92.02% of the total issued share capital of Altice Europe. On January 26, 2021 the Offeror delivered the offer price of €5.35 in cash per share (cum dividend) in respect of each tendered share and Altice Europe was delisted. On January 27, 2021, Altice Europe was merged with and into New Altice Europe B.V. (“Company Sub”), all assets, liabilities and legal relationships of Altice Europe were acquired by Company Sub and Altice Europe ceased to exist. On January 29, 2021, non-tendering shareholders were paid €5.35 per share.

 32.3. Portugal restructuring plan

 In connection with an ongoing transformation process of the Group in Portugal, in a severe context resulting not only from the COVID-19 pandemic but also from a hostile and troubled regulatory environment, some of the Group companies in Portugal have launched a voluntary employee reduction program in March 2021. This program is aimed at employees of 50 years old or more and those that decide to enroll in the program, subject to the companies’ acceptance, have their employment agreements terminated and will be entitled to receive a monthly fixed compensation up to retirement age corresponding to a percentage of their previous remuneration. The deadline for employees to enroll in the program has already finished, but the selection process of the employees that will be allowed to terminate their employment agreements under this pre-retirement scheme is still ongoing. As a result of this program, a liability will be recognized corresponding to the present value of salaries payable up to retirement age to those employees that terminate their employment agreements under this pre-retirement scheme.

 REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE

 Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

 Opinion

 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Altice International S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries (the “Group”),

 which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2019, and the consolidated

 statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash

 flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant

 accounting policies.

 In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the

 consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2019, and its consolidated financial performance and its

 consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)

 as adopted by the European Union.

 Basis for Opinion

 We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 on the audit profession (Law of July 23, 2016) and

 with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as adopted for Luxembourg by the “Commission de Surveillance du

 Secteur Financier” (CSSF). Our responsibilities under the Law of July 23, 2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg

 by the CSSF are further described in the “Responsibilities of the “Réviseur d’Entreprises Agréé” for the “Audit of the

 Consolidated Financial Statements” section of our report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the

 International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) as

 adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the

 consolidated financial statements and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements.

 We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.


-----

###### Responsibilities of the Board of Managers for the consolidated financial statements

 The Board of Managers is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial

 statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Board

 of Managers determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from

 material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Managers is responsible for assessing the Group’s

 ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going

 concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Managers either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease

 operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

 Responsibilities of the “Réviseur d’Entreprises Agréé” for the Audit of the consolidated financial statements

 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are

 free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of the “Réviseur d’Entreprises

 Agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an

 audit conducted in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the

 CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are

 considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic

 decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

 As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the

 CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

 • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to

 fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is

 sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement

 resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,

 intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are

 appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the

 Group’s internal control.


-----

###### • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and

 related disclosures made by the Board of Managers.

 • Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Managers’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,

 based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that

 may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a

 material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of the “Réviseur d’Entreprises

 Agréé” to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,

 to modify our opinion. . Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report

 of the “Réviseur d’Entreprises Agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to

 continue as a going concern.

 • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the

 disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events

 in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

 • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business

 activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible

 for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit

 opinion.

 We communicate with the Board of Managers regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the

 audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during

 our audit.

 1.1. Basis of presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements

 The consolidated financial statements of the Group as of December 31, 2019 and for the year then ended (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”) were approved by the Board of Managers and authorized for issue on April 10, 2020.

 The Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2019 and for the year then ended are presented in millions of Euros, except as otherwise stated, and have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted in the European Union (“IFRS”). 

 The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain properties and financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies.

 Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company considers the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these Consolidated Financial Statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 16 Leases, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in IAS 2 Inventories or value in use in IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.

 For financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:

 • Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date;
 • Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
 • Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability (please refer to note 19). 

 Where the accounting treatment of a specific transaction is not addressed by any accounting standard and interpretation, the Board of Managers applies its judgment to define and apply accounting policies that provide information consistent with the general IFRS concepts: faithful representation and relevance.


-----

###### 1.2. Significant accounting judgments and estimates

 In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Board of Managers is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not clear from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

 The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

 These judgments and estimates relate principally to the provisions for legal claim, the post-employments benefits, revenue recognition, fair value of financial instruments, deferred taxes, impairment of goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, trade receivables, other receivables and right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are described in the note 2.27. 

 1.3. Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)

 1.3.1. Standards applicable for the reporting period

 The following standards have mandatory application for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 as described in note 1.3.3:

 • IFRS 16 Leases, effective on January 1, 2019; 
 • Annual improvements cycle 2015-2017, effective on or after January 1, 2019;
 • IFRS Interpretation Committee (“IFRIC”) 23: Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, applicable for annual
 periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019;

 • Amendments to IFRS 9: Prepayments features with Negative Compensation, effective on or after January 1,
 2019;

 • Amendments to IAS 28: Long term interests in Associates and Joint ventures, effective on or after January 1,
 2019;

 • Amendments to IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement, effective on or after January 1, 2019;
 and

 • Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendment to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7), effective on or after January
 1, 2020. 

 The application of amendments to IAS 19, IAS 28, IFRS 9 and annual improvements cycle 2015-2017 had no material impact on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements and had no material impact on the disclosures in these Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, IFRIC 23 had no material impact on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements and resulted in a reclassification of the provisions for tax risk to deferred tax liabilities and current tax payable.

 The impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases and the accounting policies relating to the application of the IFRS 16 Leases are described respectively in notes 1.3.3 and 2.12. 

 In addition, the Group has elected to make an early application, from January 1, 2019, of the amendment related to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 published in September 2019 by the IASB (effective on or after January 1, 2020). In the new amendment, the IASB has modified specific hedge accounting requirements so that entities would apply those hedge accounting requirements assuming that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and cash flows of the hedging instrument are based is not altered as a result of the uncertainties of the interest rate benchmark reform. The amendments apply to all hedging relationships that are directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform. Interest rate benchmark reform refers to the market-wide reform of an interest rate benchmark, including the replacement of an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate such as that resulting from the recommendations set out in the FSB’s July 2014 report Reforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks.

 Based on the application of the new amendment, the existing hedge accounting relationships within the Group are not impacted as a result of the uncertainties of the interest rate benchmark reform. The Group is assessing the consequences related to the future modification of the interest rate benchmark.


-----

###### 1.3.2. Standards and interpretations not applicable as of reporting date

 The Group has not early adopted the following standards and interpretations, for which application is not mandatory for periods before January 1, 2020 and that may impact the amounts reported:

 • Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Definition of Material, effective on or after January 1, 2020;

 • Amendments to IFRS 3: Definition of a Business, effective on or after January 1, 2020; 

 • Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards, effective on or after January 1, 2020; 

 • Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture, effective date of the amendments has not yet been determined by the IASB; and

 • Amendments in Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1), effective on or after January 1, 2022. 

 The Board of Managers anticipates that the application of those amendments will not have a material impact on amounts reported in respect of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities.

 1.3.3. IFRS 16 Leases

 IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. The standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for most leases under a single on-balance sheet model. 

 The change of definition of a lease mainly relates to the conception of control. IFRS 16 determines whether a contract contains a lease on the basis of whether the customer has the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration.

 Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from IAS 17. Lessors will continue to classify leases as either operating or finance leases using similar principles as in IAS 17. Therefore, IFRS 16 did not have an impact for leases where the Group is the lessor. 

 The Group adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method of adoption with the date of initial application of January 1, 2019. Under this method, the standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised at the date of initial application. Therefore, the Consolidated Financial Statements were not restated under the new standard.

 The effect of adoption IFRS 16 as at January 1, 2019 is as follows:

**Effect of adoption IFRS 16** **January 1,**

**(€m)** **2019**

Property, plant & equipment (18.8)

Right-of-use assets 896.3

Trade and other receivables (1.5)

**Total assets** **876.0**

Equity 
Other financial liabilities - non-current (36.5)

Lease liability - non-current 852.9

Other financial liabilities - current (17.5)

Lease liability - current 77.1

**Total liabilities** **876.0**

###### The Group has lease contracts related to mobile sites (land, space in cell towers or rooftop, agreement with towers company), network infrastructure (including local loop unbundling), buildings used for administrative or technical purposes and other assets (vehicles). Before the adoption of IFRS 16, the Group classified each of its leases (as lessee) at the inception date as either a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease was classified as a finance lease if it transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset to the Group; otherwise it was classified as an operating lease. 


-----

###### Finance leases were capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments were apportioned between interest (recognised as finance costs) and reduction of the lease liability. 

 In an operating lease, the leased property was not capitalised and the lease payments were recognised as rent expense in the consolidated statement of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any prepaid rent and accrued rent were recognised under Trade and other receivables and Trade and other payables, respectively.

 Upon adoption of IFRS 16, the Group applied a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases that it is the lessee. The Group recognised lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. The standard provides specific transition requirements and practical expedients, which have been applied by the Group:

 • Right-of-use assets are reported separately in the statement of financial position. 
 • The recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of IFRS 16 are also applied to short-term leases
 and leases of low-value assets. 

 • A distinction is made in leases that contain both lease components and non-lease components except for master
 service agreements with towers company.

 • Application of the portfolio approach for the recognition and measurements of certain asset categories with
 similar characteristics (same residual value, same economic environment), mainly for local loop unbundling.

 • Application of the standard to contracts that were previously identified as leases under IAS 17 / IFRIC 4 at the
 transition date.

 • Calculate outstanding liability for existing operating leases using the incremental borrowing rate at date of
 transition.

 • IFRS 16 is not applied to leases for intangible assets.
 • The Group chooses to apply the relief option, which allows it to adjust the right-of-use asset by the amount of
 any provision for onerous leases recognised in the balance sheet immediately before the date of initial application.

 Based on the aforementioned, as at January 1, 2019: 

 • Right-of-use assets of €896.3 million were recognised and presented separately in the statement of financial
 position. This includes the lease assets recognised previously under finance leases of €18.8 million that were reclassified from Property, plant and equipment. 

 • Additional lease liabilities of €930.1 million (current and non-current) were recognised (including the
 reclassification of finance lease liabilities already recorded as of December 31, 2018 of €54.0 million). 

 • Trade and other receivables of €1.5 million related to previous operating leases were derecognised. 

 In addition, the Group is closely monitoring the work of IASB and the IFRS Interpretation Committee, aiming to clarify interpretation of IFRS 16, which could lead to a revision of the accounting policies applied by the Group.

 The lease liabilities as at January 1, 2019 can be reconciled to the operating lease commitments as of December 31, 2018 as follows:

**Reconciliation of lease liabilities** **January 1,**

**(€m)** **2019**

**Operating lease obligations as at December 31, 2018** **1,544.2**

Period revised for IFRS 16[1] 21.6

Other[2] 77.6

**Gross lease liability under IFRS 16 as at January 1, 2019** **1,643.4**

Discounting effect (767.4)

**Lease liability as at January 1, 2019** **876.0**

_Long term_ _816.4_

_Short term_ _59.6_

**Finance lease debt** **54.0**

**Total Lease liabilities as of January 1, 2019** **930.0**

_Long term_ _852.9_

_Short term_ _77.1_

1 This line includes mainly the effect of renewal options not taken in the minimum lease payments as well as the unbundling local loop rental
costs that were not included in the minimum lease payments.

2 This line includes mainly the effect of the change in scope of PHI that is consolidated since January 1, 2019 (please refer to note 3.1.1).

 Significant accounting policies

 2.1. Basis of consolidation

 2.1.1. Subsidiaries

 Entities are fully consolidated if the Group has all the following:

 • power over the investee;
 • exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
 • the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

 The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. If the Group does not have a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally.

 The Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether the Group’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:

 • the size of the Group’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders;
 • potential voting rights held by the Group, other vote holders or other parties;
 • rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
 • any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Group has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings.

 Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.

 Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Group and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Group and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Non- controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein.

 Adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.

 2.1.2. Joint arrangements

 In accordance with IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, arrangements subject to joint control are classified as either a joint venture or a joint operation. The classification of a joint arrangement as a joint operation or a joint venture depends upon the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement.

 A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Investment in which the Group is a joint operator recognises its shares in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.

 A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Investment in which the Company is a joint venturer recognises its interest in the joint venture in accordance with the equity method.


-----

###### 2.1.3. Associates

 Investments, over which the Company exercises significant influence, but not control, are accounted for under the equity method. Such investees are referred to as “associates” throughout these Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over these policies. Associates are initially recognised at cost at acquisition date. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group’s share of income and expenses, from the date significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.

 The interest income and expenses recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group on loans with associates have not been eliminated in the consolidated statement of income and therefore are still recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 2.2. Foreign currencies

 The presentation currency of the Consolidated Financial Statements is euro. The functional currency, which is the currency that best reflects the economic environment in which the subsidiaries of the Group operate and conduct their transactions, is separately determined for the Group’s subsidiaries and associates and is used to measure their financial position and operating results.

 2.2.1. Monetary transactions

 Transactions denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary are translated at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate and the resulting exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated statement of income.

 2.2.2. Translation of financial statements denominated in foreign currencies

 Assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into euros using exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. The consolidated statements of income and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rates for the period. Foreign exchange differences resulting from such translations are either recorded in shareholders’ equity under “Currency translation reserve” (for the Group share) or under “Non-controlling interests” (for the share of non-controlling interests) as deemed appropriate.

 The exchange rates of the main currencies were as follows:

**Foreign exchange rates used** **Annual average rate** **Rate at the reporting date**

**(€)** **2019** **2018** **Dec 31, 2019** **Dec 31, 2018**

Dominican Pesos (DOP) 0.01741 0.01711 0.01680 0.01738

Israeli Shekel (ILS) 0.25062 0.23572 0.25781 0.23315

United States Dollar (USD) 0.89327 0.84666 0.89055 0.87321

Swiss Franc (CHF) 0.89888 0.86568 0.92131 0.88844

Moroccan Dirham (MAD) 0.09288 0.09027 0.09317 0.09132

###### 2.3. Revenue recognition

 Revenue from the Group’s activities is mainly composed of television, broadband internet, fixed and mobile telephony subscription, installations fees invoiced to residential and business clients and advertising revenues.

 Revenue comprises the expected consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, discounts and after eliminating intercompany sales within the Group. 

 In accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the revenue recognition model includes five steps for analysing transactions so as to determine when to recognise revenue and at what amount: 

 • Identifying the contract with the customer. 

 • Identifying separate performance obligations in the contract. 

 • Determining the transaction price. 

 • Allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations. 


-----

###### • Recognizing revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied.

 For bundled packages, the Group accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct – i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if the product or service is distinct from other items in the bundle. The consideration is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the market prices at which the Group sells the mobile devices and telecommunications services separately. This could lead to the recognition of a contract asset – a receivable arising from the customer contract that has not yet legally come into existence – in the statement of financial position. 

 The contract asset is amortized over the enforceable period. Enforceable period has been determined for each agreement. It represents the period over which rights and obligation are enforceable. This period is determined not only by the commitment period as stated in the contract, but also by business practices and contracts mechanisms (early renewal, exit options, penalties and other clauses).

 2.3.1. Revenues from the sale of equipment

 The Group recognises revenues when a customer takes possession of the device, which is the performance obligation. This usually occurs when the customer signs a new contract. The amount of revenue includes the sale of mobile devices and ancillary equipment for those devices. For mobile devices sold separately, customers pay in full at the point of sale or in several instalments (credit agreement).

 2.3.2. Revenues on separable components of bundle packages

 Revenues from telephone packages are recorded as a sale with multiple components. Revenues from sales of handsets (mobile phones and other) are recorded upon activation of the line, net of discounts granted to the customer via the point of sale and the costs of activation.

 When elements of these transactions cannot be identified or analysed separately from the main offer, they are considered as related elements and the associated revenues are recognised in full over the duration of the contract or the expected duration of the customer relationship.

 2.3.3. Revenue from service

 Revenues from subscriptions for basic cable services, digital television pay, Internet and telephony (fixed and mobile) are recognised in revenue on a straight-line basis over the subscription period; revenues from telephone calls are recognised in revenue when the service is rendered in accordance with the term of the contract.

 The Group sells certain telephone subscriptions based on plans under which the call minutes for a given month can be carried over to the next month if they are not used. The minutes carried over are recorded based on the proportion of total telephone subscription revenues they represent, when the minutes are used or when they expire.

 Revenues relative to incoming and outgoing calls and off-plan calls are recorded when the service is provided. Revenues generated by vouchers sold to distributors and by prepaid mobile cards are recorded each time use is made by the end customer, as from when the vouchers and cards are activated. Any unused portion is recorded in contract liabilities at the end of the reporting period. Revenues are in any case recognised upon the expiry date of the cards, or when the use of the vouchers is statistically unlikely.

 Sales of services to subscribers managed by the Group on behalf of content providers (principally special numbers and SMS+) are recorded on a gross basis, or net of repayments to the content providers when the content providers are responsible for the content and determine the pricing applied to the subscriber.

 The costs of access to the service or installation costs principally billed to operator and corporate clients in relation to DSL connection services, bandwidth services, and IP connectivity services, are recognised over the expected duration of the contractual relationship and the provision of the principal service.

 Installation service revenue is deferred and recognised over the benefit period. For business service subscribers, the benefit period is the contract term, which is defined and agreed for 2 years or more. For residential customers, there is no commitment period and installation costs are recognised over the estimated benefit period.


-----

###### Revenues linked to switched services are recognised each time traffic is routed. Revenues from bandwidth, IP connectivity, high-speed local access and telecommunications services are recorded as and when the services are delivered to the customers.

 2.3.4. Access to telecommunications infrastructures

 The Group provides its operator clients with access to its telecommunications infrastructures by means of different types of contracts: rental, hosting contracts or concessions of Indefeasible Rights of Use (‘‘IRU’’). The IRU contracts grant the use of an asset (ducting, fibre optic or bandwidth) for a specified period. The Group remains the owner of the asset. Proceeds generated by rental contracts, hosting contracts in Netcenters, and infrastructure IRUs are recognised over the duration of the corresponding contracts, except where these are defined as a finance lease, in which case the equipment is considered as having been sold on credit.

 In the case of IRUs, and sometimes rentals or service agreements, the service is paid in advance in the first year. These prepayments, which are non-refundable, are recorded in prepaid income and recognised over the expected term of the related agreements.

 2.3.5. Sales of infrastructure

 The Group builds infrastructure on behalf of certain clients. The average duration of the construction work is less than one year; therefore, revenues are recorded when ownership is transferred. A provision is recognised when any contracts are expected to prove onerous.

 2.3.6. Advertising revenues

 Advertising revenues are recognised when commercials are aired. 

 For revenue related to space to display video advertisements online sold either directly to clients or to advertising agencies (the clients), the Group generates revenue when a user clicks on the banner ad or views the advertisement. The Group prices the advertising campaigns on a cost per view (“CPV”) model or a cost per mille (“CPM”) model based on the number of views generated by users on each advertising campaign. Revenue is recognised when four basic criteria are met: 

 • persuasive evidence exists of an arrangement with the client reflecting the terms and conditions under which
 the services will be provided (insertion order, which are commonly based on specified CPVs and related campaign budgets); 

 • services have been provided or delivery has occurred. Income relating to services provided is recorded based
 on the stage of completion of the service. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the work performed at the reporting date. For on-going service agreements, the stage of completion is prorated over time. In case of negative margin for a campaign, accrual for future loss is booked.

 • the fee is fixed or determinable; and 
 • collection is probable. Collectability is assessed based on a number of factors, including the creditworthiness
 of a client, the size and nature of a client’s website and transaction history. 

 Amounts billed or collected in excess of revenue recognised are included as deferred revenue. An example of such deferred revenue would be arrangements whereby clients request or are required by the Group to pay in advance of delivery.

 2.3.7. Income from credit arrangements

 Revenues deriving from long-term credit arrangements (such as the sale of devices in instalments) are recorded at the present value of the future cash flows (against long-term receivables) and are discounted in accordance with market interest rates. The difference between the original amount of the credit and the present value, as aforesaid, is spread over the length of the credit period and recorded as interest income over the length of the credit period.

 2.3.8. Gross versus net revenue recognition

 The Group determines whether it is acting as a principal or as an agent. The Group is acting as a principal if it controls a promised good or service before it is transferred to a customer. 


-----

###### Indicators for acting as a principal include: (1) the Group is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service, (2) the Group has inventory risk in the specified good or service and (3) the Group has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. 

 On the other hand, the Group is acting as an agent or an intermediary, if these criteria are not met. When the Group is acting as an agent, revenue is presented on a net basis in the statement of income. When the Group is acting as principal, revenue is presented on a gross basis.

 2.4. Finance costs, net

 Finance costs, net primarily comprise:

 • Interest charges and other expenses paid for financing operations recognised at amortized cost;
 • Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments;
 • Ineffective portion of hedges that qualify for hedge accounting;
 • Foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary transactions;
 • Interest income relating to cash and cash equivalents;
 • Gains/losses on extinguishment of financial liability;
 • Investment securities and investment securities pledged as collateral (Comcast investment) are classified as
 trading securities and are stated at fair value with realized and unrealized holding gains and losses included in net financial result.

 2.5. Taxation

 Taxes on income in the income statement include current taxes and deferred taxes. The tax expenses or income in respect of current taxes or deferred taxes are recognised in profit or loss unless they relate to items that are recorded directly in equity, in these cases the tax effect is reflected under the relevant equity item.

 2.5.1. Current tax

 The current tax liability is measured using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of reporting period as well as adjustments required in connection with the tax liability in respect of previous years.

 2.5.2. Deferred tax

 Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, tax loss carry-forwards and unused tax credits, insofar as it is probable that a taxable profit will be available, or when a current tax liability exists to make use of those deductible temporary differences, tax loss carry-forwards and unused tax credits, except where the deferred tax asset associated with the deductible temporary difference is generated by initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination, and that, at the transaction date, does not impact earnings, nor income tax profit or loss.

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the expected tax rates for the year during which the asset will be realized or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax regulations) enacted or substantially enacted by the closing date. They are reviewed at the end of each year, in line with any changes in applicable tax rates.

 The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each closing date and revalued or reduced to the extent that it is more or less probable that a taxable profit will be available to allow the deferred tax asset to be utilized. When assessing the probability of a taxable profit being available, account is taken, primarily, of prior years’ results, forecasted future results, non-recurring items unlikely to occur in the future and the tax strategy.

 Taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and other associated entities, deferred tax liabilities are recorded except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied: the parent, investor or venturer can control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.

 All deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position as non-current assets and non- current liabilities, respectively. Deferred taxes are offset if an enforceable legal right exists, which enables the


-----

###### offsetting of a current tax asset against a current tax liability and the deferred taxes relate to the same entity, which is chargeable to tax, and to the same tax authority.

 2.5.3. Uncertain tax positions 

 The Group determines the accounting tax position when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments based on the provisions of IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income tax. Based on the Interpretation, the Group determines whether uncertain tax positions are assessed separately or as a group and assess whether it is probable that a tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment used, or proposed to be used, by an entity in its income tax filings: 

 • If yes, the Group determines its accounting tax position consistently with the tax treatment used or planned to be used in its income tax filings. 

 • If no, the Group reflects the effect of uncertainty in determining its accounting tax position using either the most likely amount or the expected value method.

 2.6. Site dismantling and restoration

 The Company has a contractual obligation to dismantle and restore the sites of its mobile and fixed network upon expiry of a lease, if the lease is not renewed. Considering this obligation, site restoration costs are capitalized based on:

 • an average unit cost of restoring sites;

 • assumptions concerning the lifespan of the dismantling asset; and

 • a discount rate.

 2.7. Goodwill and business combinations

 Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred to the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group from the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

 At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value, except that:

 • deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;

 • liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payments at the acquisition date; and

 • assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.

 Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.

 Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Other types of non-controlling interests are measured at fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in another IFRS.


-----

###### When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.

 The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, or IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss.

 Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

 For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

 A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.

 On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

 Acquisition under common control

 In the absence of specific guidance under IFRS for transactions between entities under common control, the Company considered and applied standards on business combination and transactions between entities under common control issued by the accounting standard-setting bodies in the United States (Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810-10-45-10 and Topic 810-10-55-1B Consolidation and SEC Regulation S-X Article 3A – Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements) and in the United Kingdom (FRS 6 Acquisitions and mergers) to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Acquisition under common control uses the following methods and principles:

 • Carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the parties to the combination are not required to be adjusted to fair value on consolidation, although appropriate adjustments should be made to achieve uniformity of accounting policies in the combining entities;

 • The results and cash flows of all the combining entities should be brought into the Consolidated Financial Statements of the combined entity from the beginning of the financial year preceding the year in which the combination occurred, adjusted to achieve uniformity of accounting policies;

 • The difference, if any, between the nominal value of the shares issued plus the fair value of any other consideration given, and the nominal value of the shares received in exchange should be shown as a movement on Additional Paid in Capital in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Any existing balance on the share premium account of the new subsidiary undertaking should be brought in by being shown as a movement on Additional Paid in Capital. These movements should be shown in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ equity.

 2.8. Intangible assets

 Intangible assets acquired separately are recorded at cost on initial recognition, with the addition of direct acquisition costs. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value as of the date of acquisition.


-----

###### Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and less any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets have either definite or indefinite useful lives.

 Assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives and tested for signs that would indicate impairment in value. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least once a year. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits that are expected to derive from the asset are treated as a change in an accounting estimate which is treated prospectively.

**_The useful lives of the intangible assets are as follows:_** **Duration**

Software 3 years

Brands 5 to 15 years

Customer relations 4 to 17 years

Licences over the period of licences

Indefeasible Right of use 3-30 years

Subscriber purchase costs based on average duration of subscriptions

Franchises finite and indefinite

###### Customer relations established in connection with acquisitions that are finite lived are amortized in a manner that reflects the pattern in which the projected net cash inflows to the Company are expected to occur, such as the sum of the years’ digits method, or when such pattern does not exist, using the straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.

 Franchise rights are periodically reviewed to determine if each franchise has a finite life or an indefinite life in accordance with goodwill and other intangible asset financial accounting standards. Accordingly, the Company believes its franchises qualify for indefinite life treatment and are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances. Costs incurred in negotiating and renewing broadband franchises are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the renewal period.

 Other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually as well as where there is an indication that it may be impaired by comparing their carrying amount with their recoverable amount.

 Operating licenses for telephony services are recorded based on the fixed amount paid upon acquisition of the license.

 Investments made in the context of concessions or public service contracts, and linked to the rollout of the telecommunications network, are recorded in intangible assets in accordance with interpretation IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements. The ‘‘intangible asset’’ model stipulated by this interpretation applies when the concession holder receives a right to bill users of the public service and the concession holder is essentially paid by the user. These intangible assets are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the categories of assets in question and the duration of the concession.

 Intangible assets also comprise rights of use or access rights obtained. Amortization is generally calculated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the contractual term and 30 years.

 Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs are capitalised as intangible assets when the following can be demonstrated:

 • the technical feasibility of the project and the availability of the adequate resources for the completion of the intangible assets;

 • the ability of the asset to generate future economic benefit;

 • the ability to measure reliably the expenditures attributable to the asset; and

 • the feasibility and intention of the Group to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.

 Content rights

 Exclusive sports broadcasting rights are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position from the point at which the legally enforceable licence period begins. Rights for which the licence period has not started are disclosed as contractual commitments in note 29. Payments made to acquire broadcasting rights in advance of the legal right to broadcast the programmes are classified as prepayments in the caption “other financial assets” in the statement of financial position. Broadcasting rights are initially recognised at cost and are amortised from the point at which they are available for use, on a straight-line basis over the broadcasting period. The amortisation charge is recorded in the


-----

###### caption “depreciation and amortisation” in the consolidated statement of income. The costs of exclusive in-house content and external content are recognised as an intangible asset. The cost of the rights is recognised at the cost of production of the shows and is amortized based on the actual screenings. The amortisation charge is recorded in the caption “depreciation and amortisation” in the income statement.

 2.9. Impairment of tangible and intangible assets

 At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.

 Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

 Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

 If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

 When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash- generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

 2.10. Property, plant and equipment

 Property, plant and equipment are presented at cost with the addition of direct purchase costs less accumulated depreciation and accumulated losses on impairment and they do not include routine maintenance expenses. The cost includes spare parts and ancillary equipment that can only be used in connection with the plant and machinery.

 Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: 

**_The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment were:_** **Duration**

Buildings 5 to 50 years

Cables and mobile network 5 to 40 years

Converters and modems 3 to 5 years

Computers and ancillary equipment 2 to 8 years

Office furniture and equipment 3 to 15 years

###### Leasehold contracts are depreciated according to the straight-line method during the rental period.

 Elements of a fixed asset item, having a cost that is significant in comparison to the overall cost of the item, are depreciated separately, using the components method. The depreciation is calculated in accordance with the straight- line method at annual rates that are sufficient to depreciate the assets over the length of their estimated useful lives.

 The useful life, depreciation method and residual value of an asset are reviewed at least annually; any changes are accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.

 2.11. Contract costs

 The Group recognises as an asset the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if it expects to recover those costs. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that the Group incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. Commissions to third parties


-----

###### and sales incentives to employees are considered as costs to obtain a contract and are recognised under the balance sheet caption “contract costs”. 

 Assets recognised as contract costs are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. The asset may relate to goods or services to be transferred under a specific anticipated contract. The amortization charge is recognised in the statement of income, within caption “Depreciation, amortization and impairment”.

 As a practical expedient, the Group recognises the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the Group otherwise would have recognised is one year or less.

 2.12. Leasing

 2.12.1. Policy applicable from January 1, 2019

 2.12.1.1.The Group as a lessee 

 The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract. The Group recognises right- of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of- use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment.

 At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

 In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.

 The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

 The Group has the option, under some of its leases, to lease the assets for additional terms. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. 

 After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew (e.g., a change in business strategy). The Group included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of technical sites due to the significance of these assets to its operations. 

 The recognition and measurement requirements for lessee are also applied to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.

 2.12.1.2.The Group as lessor

 When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.


-----

###### To classify each lease, the Group makes and overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. 

 When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interest in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right of use asset arising from the head lease.

 The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 2.12.2. Policy applicable before January 1, 2019

 Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

 2.12.2.1.The Group as lessee

 Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Company at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation.

 Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalized in accordance with the Company’s general policy on borrowing costs (please refer to note 2.13 below). Contingent rentals are recognised as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.

 Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

 If lease incentives are received to enter operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

 2.12.2.2.The Group as a lessor

 Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Group’s net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated in an accounting period so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Group’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.

 Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 2.13. Borrowing costs

 Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

 2.14. Government grants

 Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.


-----

###### Government grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. Specifically, government grants whose primary condition is that the Company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-current assets are recognised as a deduction of the related asset in the consolidated statement of financial position and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets.

 Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable. The benefit of a government loan at a below-market interest rate is measured at the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest rates.

 2.15. Financial assets

 Except for certain trade receivables, under IFRS 9, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. 

 Debt financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), amortised cost, or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). 

 The classification is based on two criteria: the Group’s business model for managing the assets; and whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows represent ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the principal amount outstanding (the ‘SPPI criterion’). 

 The classification and measurement of the Group’s debt financial assets are, as follows: 

 • Debt instruments at amortised cost for financial assets that are held within a business model with the objective
 to hold the financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows that meet the SPPI criterion. This category includes the Group’s Trade and other receivables, and Loans included under balance sheet caption “Financial assets” (non-current and current portion). 

 • Debt instruments at FVOCI, with gains or losses recycled to profit or loss on derecognition. The Group has no
 instrument in this new category. 

 Other financial assets are classified and subsequently measured, as follows: 

 • Equity instruments at FVOCI, with no recycling of gains or losses to profit or loss on derecognition. This
 category only includes equity instruments, which the Group intends to hold for the foreseeable future and which the Group has irrevocably elected to so classify upon initial recognition or transition. The Group classified its quoted and unquoted equity instruments as equity instruments at FVOCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment under IFRS 9. 

 • Financial assets at FVPL comprise derivative instruments. This category would also include debt instruments
 whose cash flow characteristics fail the SPPI criterion or are not held within a business model whose objective is either to collect contractual cash flows, or to both collect contractual cash flows and sell. Financial assets at FVPL are stated at fair value, with any gains and losses arising on remeasurement recognised in the caption “Other Financial expense” or “Other Financial income” in the income statements.

 Under IFRS 9, embedded derivatives are not separated from a host financial asset.

 The assessment of the Group’s business models was made as of the date of initial application, January 1, 2018. The assessment of whether contractual cash flows on debt instruments are solely comprised of principal and interest was made based on the facts and circumstances as at the initial recognition of the assets.

 Impairment of financial assets

 Under IFRS 9, accounting for impairment losses for financial assets is based on a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. IFRS 9 requires the Group to record an allowance for ECLs for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at FVPL. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive. The shortfall is then discounted at an approximation to the asset’s original effective interest rate.


-----

###### For contract assets, trade and other receivables, the Group has applied the standard’s simplified approach and has calculated ECLs based on lifetime expected credit losses. The Group records provision for doubtful debt based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. 

 2.16. Inventories

 Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories comprises costs of purchase and costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated selling costs. Cost of inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method. The Company periodically evaluates the condition and age of inventories and makes provisions for slow moving inventories accordingly.

 2.17. Cash and cash equivalents

 Cash consists of cash in banks and deposits. Cash equivalents are considered as highly liquid investments, including unrestricted short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition or with a maturity of more than three months, but which are redeemable on demand without penalty and which form part of the Group’s cash management.

 2.18. Restricted cash

 Restricted cash can consist of balances dedicated to the repayment of the Company’s liabilities to banking entities in accordance with the Company’s credit agreement and therefore amounts that the Group cannot use at its discretion. Restricted cash can also consist of cash held in escrow to finance certain acquisitions (in the period between the agreement to acquire and the actual closing of the acquisition and the transfer of shares and cash and other considerations). Restricted cash may also consist of guarantees provided by different Group companies to financial institutions related to financing or other activities. Restricted cash is not considered as a component of cash and cash equivalents since such balances are not held for the purposes of meeting short-term cash commitments.

 2.19. Derivatives

 Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered and are subsequently reassessed at their fair value.

 The Company has entered various forward and interest rate swaps (cross currency and fixed/floating) to mitigate risks associated with making investments in currencies other than the functional currency of the underlying component.

 Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The fair value estimate is subject to a credit risk adjustment that reflects the credit risk of the Group and of the counterparty. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.

 2.20. Hedge accounting

 The Group continues to apply the requirement of IAS 39 relating to hedge accounting.

 The Group may designate certain hedging instruments, (which may include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk), as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

 At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.

 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedge. The gain or loss


-----

###### relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is included in the line ‘other financial expense’.

 Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.

 Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

 2.21. Classification as debt or equity

 Debt and equity instruments issued by a Group entity are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

 2.21.1. Equity instruments

 An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Group entity are recognised at the value of the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

 Repurchase of the Group’s own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments.

 2.22. Financial liabilities

 Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities at amortized cost:

 2.22.1. Financial liabilities at amortized cost

 These financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost calculated based on the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the internal yield rate that exactly discounts future cash flows through the term of the financial liability. Fees, debt issuance and transaction costs are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate over the expected life of the instrument.

 2.22.2. Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL)

 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.

 Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at FVPL if they are acquired for sale in the near term. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in profit or loss.

 Derivatives, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, are classified as financial liabilities at FVPL unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. In the event of a financial instrument that contains one or more embedded derivatives, the entire combined instrument may be designated as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss only upon initial recognition.

 The Group assesses whether embedded derivatives are required to be bifurcated from host contracts when the Group first becomes party to the contract. Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required.

 The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in an active market is determined by reference to quoted market prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date. For financial instruments for which there is no active market,


-----

###### fair value is determined using valuation techniques. Such techniques include evaluation based on transactions that have been executed recently under market terms, reference to the current market value of another instrument, which is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.

 2.22.3. Liabilities related to put options granted to non-controlling interests

 The Group granted put options to third parties with non-controlling interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries. These options give the holders the right to sell part or all of their investment in these subsidiaries. 

 At inception, in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, when non-controlling interests hold put options enabling them to sell their investment in the Group, a financial liability is recognised for an amount corresponding to the present value of liability assumed and the counterpart of the liability arising from these obligations is:

 • the reclassification as debt of the carrying amount of the corresponding non-controlling interests;

 • a reduction in the equity attributable to owners of the Company (other reserves attributable to equity holders of the parent) for the difference between the present value of the strike price of the options granted and the carrying amount of non-controlling interests.

 In the absence of specific IFRS guidance, the accounting at the end of each reporting period is as follows, while the non-controlling interest put remains unexercised:

 (1) recognition of the non-controlling interest, including an allocation of profit or loss, allocation of changes in other
 comprehensive income and dividends declared for the reporting period, as required by IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements as mentioned in note 2.1.1;
 (2) derecognition of the non-controlling interest as if it was acquired at that date; (3) recognition of a financial liability at the present value of the amount payable on exercise of the NCI put in
 accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement; and
 (4) the difference between no (2) and (3) above is accounted for as an equity transaction.

 If the NCI put is exercised, the same treatment is applied up to the date of exercise. The amount recognised as the financial liability at that date is extinguished by the payment of the exercise price.

 If the NCI put expires unexercised, the position is unwound so that the non-controlling interest is recognised at the amount it would have been, as if the put option had never been granted (i.e. measured initially at the date of the business combination, and remeasured for subsequent allocations of profit or loss, other comprehensive income and changes in equity attributable to the non-controlling interest). The financial liability is derecognised, with a corresponding credit to the same component of equity.

 The Group is closely monitoring the work of the IASB and the IFRIC, which could lead to a revision of the treatment of put options granted to non-controlling interests.

 2.23. Provisions

 A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present obligation (legal or implicit) as the result of a past event and it is expected that the use of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and it is possible to reliably estimate it. Where the impact is significant, the provision is measured by discounting the forecasted future cash flows, using a pre-tax interest rate that reflects the expectations of the market in respect of the time frame of the money and in certain cases, the risks that are specific to the liability.

 The following types of provisions are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements:

 2.23.1. Claims

 A provision regarding claims is recognised when the Group has a present legal commitment or an implicit commitment resulting from a past event; when it is more likely than not that the Group will be required to expand economic resources to clear the commitment, when it is possible to estimate it reliably and when the effect of time is significant, the provision is measured according to the present value.


-----

###### 2.23.2. Onerous contracts

 Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract.

 2.23.3. Restructuring

 A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the Group.

 2.24. Liabilities for employment benefits

 2.24.1. Retirement benefit costs and termination benefits

 Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re- measurement recognised in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss in the period of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.

 Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:

 • service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements);

 • net interest expense or income; and

 • re-measurement.

 The Group presents the service cost and the net interest expense in profit or loss in the line item “Staff cost and employee benefit expenses” and “Other financial expenses” respectively. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past service costs.

 The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.

 A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefit and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs.

 2.24.2. Short-term and other long-term employee benefits

 A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave in the period the related service is rendered at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service.

 Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.

 Liabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee benefits are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows expected to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date.


-----

###### 2.25. Share-based payments

 2.25.1. Share-based payment transactions of the Company

 Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.

 The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity- settled employee benefits reserve.

 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, except where that fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service.

 For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.

 2.25.2. Share-based payment transactions of the acquiree in a business combination

 When the share-based payment awards held by the employees of an acquiree (acquiree awards) are replaced by the Group’s share-based payment awards (replacement awards), both the acquiree awards and the replacement awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment ("market-based measure") at the acquisition date. The portion of the replacement awards that is included in measuring the consideration transferred in a business combination equals the market-based measure of the acquiree awards multiplied by the ratio of the portion of the vesting period completed to the greater of the total vesting period or the original vesting period of the acquiree award. The excess of the market-based measure of the replacement awards over the market-based measure of the acquiree awards included in measuring the consideration transferred is recognised as remuneration cost for post-combination service.

 However, when the acquiree awards expire because of a business combination and the Group replaces those awards when it does not have an obligation to do so, the replacement awards are measured at their market-based measure in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. All market-based measures of the replacement awards are recognised as remuneration cost for post-combination service.

 At the acquisition date, when the outstanding equity-settled share-based payment transactions held by the employees of an acquiree are not exchanged by the Group for its share-based payment transactions, the acquiree share-based payment transactions are measured at their market-based measure at the acquisition date. If the share-based payment transactions have vested by the acquisition date, they are included as part of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree. However, if the share-based payment transactions have not vested by the acquisition date, the market-based measure of the unvested share-based payment transactions is allocated to the non-controlling interest in the acquiree based on the ratio of the portion of the vesting period completed to the greater of the total vesting period or the original vesting period of the share-based payment transaction. The balance is recognised as remuneration cost for post-combination service.

 2.26. Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations

 Pursuant to IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, assets and liabilities of affiliates that are held for sale are presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position. Depreciation of assets ceases from the date of classification in “Non-current assets held for sale”. Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

 A discontinued operation is a component of the Group for which cash flows are independent. It represents a major line of business or geographical area of operations which has been disposed of or is currently being held for sale. If the Group reports discontinuing operations, net income from discontinued operations is presented separately on the face


-----

###### of the statement of income. Therefore, the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements related to the statement of income only refer to continuing operations.

 2.27. Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty

 In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described above, the Board of Managers of the Company is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not clear from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

 The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

 2.27.1. Critical accounting judgements

 The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are presented separately below), that the Board of Managers of the Company has made in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 - Revenue recognition

 Judgement and estimates are made for (i) the identification of the separable elements of a packaged offer and allocation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each element; (ii) the period of deferred revenues related to costs to access the service based on the type of product and the term of the contract; (iii) presentation as net or gross revenues depending on whether the Group is acting as agent or principle.

 2.27.2. Key sources of estimation uncertainty

 The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.

 - Claims

 In estimating the likelihood of outcome of claims filed against the Group and its investees and the estimated provision, the Group companies rely on the opinion of internal and/or external counsel. These estimates are based on the counsel’s best professional judgment, considering the stage of proceedings and historical precedents in respect of the different issues. Since the outcome of the claims will be determined via settlement or court’s decision, the results could differ from these estimates.

 - Post-employment benefits

 The liability in respect of post-employment defined benefit plans is determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about, among others, discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to uncertainty.

 - Fair value of financial instruments Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3

 Fair value is determined by reference to the market price at the end of the period, when the data is available. For financial instruments for which there is no active market such as interest rate swaps (which the Company currently may use to hedge its interest rate risk), call options and put options granted to non-controlling interests fair value is estimated based on models that rely on observable market data or using various valuation techniques, such as discounted future cash flows.

 - Deferred tax assets

 Deferred tax assets relate primarily to tax loss carried forwards and to deductible temporary differences between reported amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The assets relating to the tax loss carried forwards are recognised if it is probable that the Group will generate future taxable profits against which these tax losses can be set


-----

###### off. Evaluation of the Group’s capacity to utilize tax loss carried forward relies on significant judgment. The Group analyses past events, and the positive and negative elements of certain economic factors that may affect its business in the foreseeable future to determine the probability of its future utilization of these tax losses carried forward.

 - Intangible assets and Property, plant and equipment

 Estimates of useful lives are based on the effective obsolescence of fixed assets and the use made of these assets.

 - Impairment of intangible assets

 At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. The recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not available for use on the reporting date, are measured at least on an annual basis, irrespective of whether any impairment indicators exist.

 Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Board of Managers to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate to calculate present value. Where the actual future cash flows are less than expected, a material impairment loss may arise.

 - Contract assets and trade receivables

 For contract assets and trade receivables, the Group has applied the standard’s simplified approach and has calculated ECLs based on lifetime expected credit losses. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

 - Determination of the right-of-use and lease liabilities 

 The right-of-use and the lease liabilities are determined based on the lease term and the discount rate.

 • For the lease term, the Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
 • The discount rate is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.

 Scope of consolidation

 4.1. Definition of segments

 Given the geographical spread of the entities within the Group, analysis by geographical area is fundamental in determining the Group’s strategy and managing its different businesses. The Group’s chief operating decision maker is the Board of Managers. The Board of Managers analyses the Group’s results across geographies, and certain key areas by activity. The presentation of the segments here is consistent with the reporting used internally by the Board of Managers to track the Group’s operational and financial performance. The businesses that the Group owns and operates do not show significant seasonality, except for the mobile residential and business services, which can show significant changes in sales at year end and at the end of the summer season (the “back to school” period). The business


-----

###### services are also impacted by the timing of preparation of the annual budgets of public and private sector companies. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies.

 The segments that are presented are detailed below:

 • Portugal: Altice owns Portugal Telecom (“PT Portugal”), the largest telecom operator in Portugal. PT Portugal caters to fixed residential, mobile residential and business services clients using the MEO brand. As of 2018, this segment also includes the Altice Technical Services entities in Portugal. 

 • Israel: Fixed and mobile services are provided using the HOT telecom, HOT mobile and HOT net brands to residential and business services clients. HOT also produces award winning exclusive content that it distributes using its fixed network, as well as content application called Next and OTT services through Next Plus. As of 2018, this segment also includes the Altice Technical Services entity in Israel. 

 • Dominican Republic: The Group provides fixed residential, mobile residential and business services using the Altice brand. As of 2018, this segment also includes the Altice Technical Services entity in the Dominican Republic. 

 • Teads: Provides digital advertising solutions. 

 • Altice TV: Content business from the use of content rights. Altice TV was no longer part of the Group following the sale to Altice Group Lux that was closed on May 15, 2018 (please refer to note 3.2.4).

 • Others: This segment includes all corporate entities. The Board of Managers believes that these corporate operations are not substantial enough to require a separate reporting segment, and so are reported under “Others”. In 2018, this segment also included FOT. FOT is no longer part of the Group since October 31, 2018 following the sale to Altice France. 

 4.2. Financial Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”)

 The Board of Managers has defined certain financial KPIs that are tracked and reported by each operating segment every month to the senior executives of the Company. The Board of Managers believes that these indicators offer them the best view of the operational and financial efficiency of each segment and this follows best practices in the rest of the industry, thus providing investors and other analysts a suitable base to perform their analysis of the Group’s results.

 The financial KPIs tracked by the Board of Managers are:

 • Adjusted EBITDA: by segment,
 • Revenues: by segment and in terms of activity,
 • Capital expenditure (“Capex”): by segment, and
 • Operating free cash flow (“OpFCF”): by segment.

 4.2.1. Non-GAAP measures

 Adjusted EBITDA, Capex and OpFCF are non-GAAP measures. These measures are useful to readers of the Consolidated Financial Statements as they provide a measure of operating results excluding certain items that Altice’s management believe are either outside of its recurring operating activities, or items that are non-cash. Excluding such items enables trends in the Group’s operating results and cash flow generation to be more easily observable. The non- GAAP measures are used by the Group internally to manage and assess the results of its operations, make decisions with respect to investments and allocation of resources, and assess the performance of management personnel. Such performance measures are also the de facto metrics used by investors and other members of the financial community to value other companies operating in the same industry as the Group and thus are a basis for comparability between the Group and its peers. Moreover, the debt covenants of the Group are based on the Adjusted EBITDA and other associated metrics. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA used in the covenants has not changed with the adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases by the Group. 

 4.2.1.1. Adjusted EBITDA

 Following the application of IFRS 16 Leases, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, other expenses and incomes (capital gains, non-recurring litigation, restructuring costs) and share- based expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IAS 17 Leases for operating lease). This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating income as the effects of depreciation, amortization and impairment, excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, do ultimately affect the

###### operating results. Operating results presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements are in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.

 4.2.1.2. Capex

 Capex is an important indicator to follow, as the profile varies greatly between activities:

 • The fixed business has fixed Capex requirements that are mainly discretionary (network, platforms, general),
 and variable capex requirements related to the connection of new customers and the purchase of Customer Premise Equipment (TV decoder, modem, etc.).

 • Mobile Capex is mainly driven by investment in new mobile sites, upgrade to new mobile technology and
 licenses to operate; once engaged and operational, there are limited further Capex requirements.

 • Other Capex is mainly related to costs incurred in acquiring content rights.

 4.2.1.3. Operating free cash flow 

 OpFCF is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capex. This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating cash flow as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with IAS 7 Statement of Cashflows. 

 4.2.2. Revenues

 As of January 1, 2019, additional information on the revenue split is presented as follows:

 • Fixed residential: revenues from fixed business to B2C customers;

 • Mobile residential: revenues from mobiles services and equipment business to B2C subscribers;

 • Business services: revenues from B2B customers, wholesale and other revenues; and

 • Media: media, content and advertisement revenues in Teads. In 2018, Media revenues also included revenues of Altice TV.

 Intersegment revenues represented 0.1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 0.2% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 (€3.9 million compared to €6.7 million). Intersegment revenues mainly relate to services rendered by certain centralized Group functions (relating to content production, technical services and customer services) to the operational segments of the Group.

###### 5.1. Impairment of goodwill 

 The Group has chosen to organise its GCGUs based on the geographies that it operates in. For more details on the GCGUs, please refer to notes 2.9 and 5.

 Goodwill is tested at the level of each GCGU or CGU annually for impairment and whenever changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill was tested at the CGU/GCGU level for impairment as of December 31, 2019. The CGU/GCGU is at the country level where the subsidiaries operate. The recoverable amounts of the GCGUs are determined based on their value in use. The Group determined value in use for purposes of its impairment testing and, accordingly, did not determine the fair value less cost of disposal of the GCGUs. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are primarily the post-tax discount rates, the terminal growth rate, revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures. Following the application of IFRS 16 Leases, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, other expenses and incomes (capital gains, non- recurring litigation, restructuring costs) and share-based expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IAS 17 Leases for operating lease).

 The Board of Managers and the Group’s senior executives have determined that there have not been any changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. In addition, there were no significant changes in assets or liabilities in any CGU/GCGU, while the recoverable amounts continue to significantly exceed the carrying amounts. Therefore, no updated impairment testing was performed, nor any impairment recorded, for the year ended December 31, 2019.

 5.1.1. Key assumptions used in impairment testing

 The Group has made use of various external indicators and internal reporting tools to estimate the revenue growth rates used in the Group’s impairment testing for the year ended December 31, 2019.


-----

###### 5.1.1.1. Cash flows

 The value in use of each GCGU was determined by estimating cash flows for a period of five years for the operating activities. Cash flow forecasts are derived from the most recent business plans approved by the Board of Managers. Beyond the specifically forecasted period of five years, the Company extrapolates cash flows for the remaining years based on an estimated constant growth rate between 0.5% - 4.3%. The growth rate is estimated at an individual subsidiary level and does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.

 5.1.1.2. Discount rates

 Discount rates have been estimated using post-tax rates, which reflect current market rates for investments of similar risk. The discount rate for the GCGUs was estimated using the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) of companies that operate a portfolio of assets similar to the Group’s. The WACC used across the Group for the calculation of the value in use at December 31, 2019 ranges from 6.0% to 11.5%.

 5.1.1.3. Other internal assumptions

 The Groups makes assumptions of customer churn rates and operating income, or Adjusted EBITDA (and the Adjusted EBITDA margin). These assumptions were based on historical experience and expectations of future changes in the market. The Group also assumes that recurring capex is expected to be proportional to sales, related to the acquisition of new clients, and thus is indexed to the growth in revenues.

 5.1.1.4. Assumptions about external factors

 In addition to using internal indicators to assess the carrying amount in use, the Board of Managers also relies on external factors which can influence the cash generating capacity of the CGUs or GCGUs and indicate that certain factors beyond the control of the Board of Managers might influence the carrying amounts in use:

 • Indicators of market slowdown in a country of operation,

 • Indicators of degradation in financial markets, that can impact the financing ability of the Group.

**Key assumptions used in estimating value in use** **Portugal** **Israel** **Dominican** **Teads**

**Republic**

**At December 31, 2019**

Average terminal growth rate (%) 1.5% 0.5% 4.25% 1.5%

5-year average Adjusted EBITDA ratio (%) 38.1% 36.0% 50.40% 20.1%

5-year average CAPEX ratio (%) -20.2% -24.5% -18.10% -1.1%

Post tax weighted average cost of capital (%) 6.0% 7.0% 11.5% 10.0%

**At December 31, 2018**

Average terminal growth rate (%) 1.75% 1.0% 4.0% 1.75%

5-year average Adjusted EBITDA ratio (%) 38.7% 38.5% 50.1% 18.5%

5-year average CAPEX ratio (%) -17.4% -23.2% -19.2% -0.3%

Post tax weighted average cost of capital (%) 7.5% 7.0% 11.5% 11.0%

###### 5.1.2. Sensitivity analysis

 In validating the value in use determined for the GCGU, key assumptions used in the discounted cash-flow model were subject to a sensitivity analysis to test the resilience of value in use. The sensitivity analysis of the GCGUs is presented below, given changes to the material inputs to the respective valuations:


**Sensitivity to changes in key inputs in the value in use calculation**
**(€m)**


**Portugal** **Israel** **Dominican**

**Republic**


**Teads**


Amount by which the CGU exceeds the book value 1,665.8 288.4 784.0 1,603.9

Terminal growth rate for which recoverable amount is equal to -0.4% -1.0% -3.8% nm

Discount rate for which recoverable amount is equal to carrying 7.6% 8.2% 16.7% 44.5%
amount

Adjusted EBITDA ratio for which recoverable amount is equal to 33.1% 33.6% 36.7% 4.5%
carrying amount

0.5% increase in the discount rate (643.5) (134.0) (121.0) (116.0)

1.0% decrease in the terminal growth rate (1,022.4) (206.7) (180.9) (158.2)

###### The analysis did not result in any scenarios whereby a reasonable possible change in the EBITDA margin would result in a recoverable amount for the GCGU which is inferior to the carrying value, if applied to any other GCGU.

###### 5.2. Business combinations 

 The Group has not concluded any material acquisition during the past 12 months. When the Group acquires an entity, it records the provisional value of the assets and liabilities as being equivalent to the book values in the accounting records of the entity being acquired. The Group then identifies the assets and liabilities to which the purchase price needs to be allocated. The fair value is determined by an independent external appraiser based on a business plan prepared as of the date of the acquisition.

 5.2.1. Acquisitions where the purchase price allocations have been finalized during 2018

 5.2.1.1. Teads

 On June 22, 2017, Altice Teads (a company in which the Group has 98.5% of the financial interest, with 1.5% attributable to the managers of Teads) closed the acquisition of Teads. The acquisition purchase price was €302.3 million, with 75% due at closing, and the remaining 25% earn-out subject to Teads obtaining defined revenue performance in 2017, which targets have been met. As the defined revenue targets for 2017 were met, an earn-out payment of €48.6 million was made to the former owners of Teads during the second quarter of 2018, with an additional earn-out payment of €13.1 million made on July 3, 2018. 

 Following the preliminary purchase price allocation, the Group identified the following assets and liabilities. Their fair value was determined by an independent external appraiser based on a business plan prepared as of the date of the acquisition as follows:

 • the Teads brand was measured using the relief from royalty method using a useful life of 5 years, resulting in
 a fair value of €26.6 million;

 • a fair value of €50.2 million was attributed to Programatic and Managed Service technology and measured
 using the relief from royalty method with a useful life of 5 years.

 There was no change in the preliminary purchase price allocation compared to December 31, 2018 and the purchase price allocation has been finalized.

Total consideration transferred 302.3

Fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 100.6

###### The decrease in net book value of intangible assets compared to 2018 was caused mainly by accelerated amortization of brand in PT Portugal related to the rebranding of PT Empresas in the beginning of 2020. The total amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was €393.7 million and €375.2 million, respectively, please refer to note 25. 

 The majority of intangible assets are related to the recognition of intangible assets on acquisition of business combinations as a reduction in the value of attributable goodwill. The key items include:

 • Customer relations: these assets are valued using the excess earnings method upon acquisition and subsequently amortized based on the local churn rate. The carrying amount of customer relations by segment was: (i) Portugal: €533.4 million, (ii) Israel: €72.3 million, (iii) the Dominican Republic: €1.1 million.
 • Brand name: the carrying amounts of the Group’s main brand names includes: (i) MEO in Portugal: €39.6 million, (ii) HOT in Israel: €6.3 million, (iii) Teads: €13.3 million.  Content rights: corresponds mainly to content right in Israel as HOT co-develops and co-owns high-quality original local content together with local producers and broadcasts it on HOT proprietary channels. The content rights were capitalized in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets and are amortized over their respective useful lives. When useful lives extend beyond one year the nominal cash flows are discounted to their present value on initial recognition of the asset. The amortization related to content rights recorded for local production and fiction in Israel for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €43.9 million (average useful life is 3 years).

###### 10.1.1. Derivative financial instruments related to debt 

 The Group has a significant debt book and executes derivative contracts to hedge its position in compliance with its treasury policy. All derivatives are measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date. The total asset position as of December 31, 2019 was €107.6 million (2018: €89.4 million) and the increase was mainly caused by restructuring of swaps in Altice Financing. Refer also to note 17.3 for details on each of these derivatives held by the Group and to note 19 for information on the fair value of the derivatives, including the fair value hierarchy. 

 10.1.2. Loans and receivables

 The Group’s main loans and receivables as of December 31, 2019, were mainly consisting of:

 • Secured subordinated notes in Wananchi: the notes are convertible at the discretion of the holder. The investment amounts to €37.8 million and bears interest at a rate of 11% per annum (or 13% on default) payable in kind and matures in October 2021 (2018: €57.6 million bearing 11% interest). 
 • Loans in Altice Financing (€906.4 million), Altice International (€352.1 million) and Altice Holdings (€284.7 million) granted to entities within the Altice Group (mainly Altice Group Lux, Altice TV and Altice Luxembourg and Altice Corporate Financing). 

 10.1.3. Call options with non-controlling interests 

 Through the various acquisitions that the Group has completed in recent years the Group signed agreements whereby it has a call option to acquire certain residual non-controlling interests in entities that it has not acquired 100%. The call options are derivative financial instruments and must be re-measured to their fair value at balance sheet date. The carrying amount of the call options is detailed in note 19.1.

 10.1.4. Equity instrument at fair value through OCI

 As of December 31, 2019, the Group recorded €5.1 million of investments in Partner Co. Ltd (please refer to note


-----

###### 19.1.1). These investments in equity instruments are not held for trading. Instead, they are held for medium term. Accordingly, the directors of the Company have elected to designate these as equity instruments at FVTOCI.

 10.1.5. Other financial assets

 The decrease in other financial assets as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 reflected mainly the impact from the sale of SIRESP by PT Portugal of €5.9 million. 

 10.2. Other non-current assets

**Other non-current assets** **December 31,** **December 31,**

Pension assets 2.8 3.9

Other receivables 189.0 154.3

**Total** **191.8** **158.2**

###### Other non-current assets increased by €33.6 million to €191.8 million, due to higher other receivables mainly in PT Portugal due to the transfer of the long-term portion of receivables under instalments (€20.1 million) from current to non-current assets, and the increase in pension funds with surplus (€2.6 million). 

 Inventories

The Group considers that all inventory will be fully utilised in the next twelve months and is therefore classified as a current asset in the Statement of Financial Position.

###### The Group routinely evaluates the credit that is provided to its customers, while checking their financial situations; however, it does not demand collateral for those debts. The Group records provision for doubtful debt based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. The Group believes there is no risk of concentration of counterparties given the much-diversified customer basis, especially on the residential business’ side (in the Group’s largest segments a major portion of clients pay using direct debit, credit cards or online banking). For the business services, the top 20 clients of the Group represent less than 5% of total Group revenues.

###### 16.1. Details of the significant defined benefit plans

 16.1.1. Portugal

 PT Portugal sponsors defined benefit plans, under which it is responsible for the payment of pension supplements to retired and active employees and healthcare services to retired employees and eligible relatives. In addition, PT and other subsidiaries of PT Portugal are also responsible for the payment of salaries to suspended and pre-retired employees until retirement age. A detailed nature of these benefits is presented below:

 • Pension supplements - Retirees and employees of Companhia Portuguesa Rádio Marconi, S.A. (“Marconi”, a company merged into PT in 2002) hired prior to February 1, 1998 and retirees and employees of Telefones de Lisboa e Porto, S.A. (“TLP”, a company merged into PT in 1994) and Teledifusora de Portugal, S.A. (“TDP”, a company merged into PT in 1994) hired prior to June 23, 1994 are entitled to receive a supplemental pension benefit, which complements the pension paid by the Portuguese social security system. In addition, on retirement, PT pays a lump sum gratuity of a fixed amount which depends on the length of service completed by the employee and its salary. Employees hired by PT or any of its predecessor companies after the dates indicated above are not entitled to these benefits and are thus covered only by the general Portuguese Government social security system, which is a defined contribution plan in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.

 • Healthcare benefits - PT sponsors the payment of post-retirement health care benefits to certain suspended employees, pre-retired employees and retired employees and their eligible relatives. Health care services are rendered by PT - Associação de Cuidados de Saúde (“PT ACS”), which was incorporated with the only purpose of managing PT’s Health Care Plan. This plan, sponsored by PT, includes all employees hired by PT until December 31, 2000 and by Marconi until February 1, 1998. The financing of the Health Care Plan comprises defined contributions made by participants to PT ACS and the remainder by PT, which incorporated an autonomous fund in 2004 for this purpose.

 • Salaries to suspended and pre-retired employees - PT and other subsidiaries of PT Portugal are also responsible for the payment of salaries to suspended and pre-retired employees until the retirement age, which result from agreements between both parties. These liabilities are not subject to any legal funding requirement and therefore the monthly payment of salaries is made directly by each of the subsidiaries of PT Portugal.

 16.1.2. Israel

 In Israel, the plans are normally financed by contributions to insurance companies and classified as defined contribution plans or as defined benefit plans. The Group has defined contribution plans pursuant to Section 14 of the Severance Pay Law under which the Group pays regular contributions and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient amounts to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. In addition, the Group has a defined benefit plan in respect of severance pay pursuant to the Severance Pay Law. According to the law, employees are entitled to receive severance pay upon dismissal or retirement. In respect of its severance pay obligation to certain of its employees, the Group makes current deposits in pension funds and insurance companies (the “plan assets"). Plan assets comprise assets held by a long-term employee benefit fund or qualifying insurance policies. Plan assets are not available to the Group’s own creditors and cannot be returned directly to the Group.

###### 17.1.3. Refinancing 

 During the year ended December 31, 2019, no debt has been refinanced.

 17.2. Covenants

 The debt issued by the subsidiaries of the Company is subject to certain restrictive covenants, which apply in the case of debt issued by Altice Financing S.A. and Altice Finco S.A., to Altice International S.à r.l. and its restricted subsidiaries.

 Other than the revolving credit facilities, described below, such debt issued by the Group’s subsidiaries is subject to incurrence based covenants, which do not require ongoing compliance with financial ratios, but place certain limitations on the relevant restricted group’s ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional debt (including to finance new acquisitions), create liens, pay dividends and other distributions to shareholders or prepay subordinated indebtedness, make investments, sell assets, engage in affiliate transactions or engage in mergers or consolidations. These covenants are subject to several important exceptions and qualifications. 


-----

###### To be able to incur additional debt under an applicable debt instrument, the relevant restricted group must either meet the ratio test described below (on a pro forma basis for any contemplated transaction giving rise to the debt incurrence) or have available capacity under the general debt basket described below or meet certain other exceptions to the limitation on indebtedness covenant in such debt instrument. 

 Senior Secured Debt and Senior Debt is subject to an incurrence test as follows: 

 • Senior Secured debt of Altice International is subject to an incurrence test of 3:1 (Adjusted EBITDA to Net Senior Secured Debt) and Senior Debt is subject to an incurrence test of 4:1 (Adjusted EBITDA to Net Total Debt). 

 The Company or its relevant subsidiaries are allowed to fully consolidate the EBITDA from any subsidiaries in which they have a controlling interest and that are contained in the restricted group as defined in the relevant debt instruments. 

 The Group has access to various Revolving Credit Facilities, which are subject to maintenance covenants in addition to the incurrence covenants described above. 

 Revolving Credit Facilities are subject to a maintenance test as follows: 

 • Revolving Credit Facilities of Altice International are subject to a maintenance test of 5.25:1 (Adjusted EBITDA to Net Total Debt) if outstanding at the end of the quarter. 

 For details of the Revolving Credit Facilities, please refer to note 17.5. As at December 31, 2019, nil was drawn and no maintenance test was required to be performed at Altice International.

 The Group was in compliance with all the covenants described above, as of December 31, 2019.

 17.3. Derivatives financial instruments

 As part of its financial risk management strategy, the Group enters certain hedging operations. The main instruments used are fixed to fixed or fixed to floating cross-currency and interest rate swaps (“CCIRS”) that cover against foreign currency and interest rate risk related to the Group’s debt obligations. The Group applies hedge accounting for the operations that meet the eligibility criteria as defined by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

 17.3.1. Designation of derivative financial instruments

 17.3.1.1.Hedged instruments

 The Group continues to apply hedge accounting for those historical hedging operations that met the eligibility criteria as defined by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Where subsidiaries of the Group have issued debt in a currency that is different to the functional currency of the subsidiary, for example, issuing USD denominated debt in its European subsidiaries, the Group has entered into CCIRS to mitigate risks arising from the variations in foreign exchange rates. These instruments secure future cash flows in the subsidiaries functional currency and they are designated as cash flow hedges by the Group. As from 2019, hedge accounting is not applied to new CCIRS that mitigate risks arising from the variations in foreign exchange rates.

 17.3.1.2.Instruments not eligible for hedge accounting

 Those derivatives not designated in a cash flow hedge relationship are classified as derivative financial instruments recognised at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL); the change in fair value of these derivatives is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

1 The derivatives are all measured at fair value. The change in fair value of derivatives classified as cash flow hedges (CFH) in accordance with
IAS 39 _Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement is recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve. The derivatives not hedge_
accounted have the change in fair value recognised immediately in profit or loss (“FVPL”).

###### The change in fair value of all derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges was recorded in other comprehensive income for the full year ended December 31, 2019. Before the impact of taxes, gains of €39.2 million were recorded in other comprehensive income, €29.4 million net of taxes.

 17.3.2.2.Interest rate swaps

 The Group enters interest rate swaps to cover its interest rate exposure in line with its treasury policy. These swaps cover the Group’s debt portfolio and do not necessarily relate to specific debt issued by the Group.

**Total** **759.3** **1,530.5** **2,289.9** **671.6** **831.3** **1,502.8**

###### The current portion of other financial liabilities amounts to €759.3 million as at December 31, 2019, an increase of €87.7 million compared to December 31, 2018. The non-current portion of other financial liabilities amounts to €1,530.5 million as at December 31, 2019, an increase of €699.2 million compared to December 31, 2018. Details of the main items within the caption, and the movements from the prior period, are detailed below. 

 17.6.1. Leases

 The increase in current and non-current lease liabilities recorded as at December 31, 2019 is mainly explained by the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases as at January 1, 2019. The amount of finance lease existing under IAS 17 Leases as at December 31, 2018 have been reclassified under the caption lease liabilities in the statement of financial position and amounts to €39.1 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to €54.0 million as at December 31, 2018. The amounts of non-current and current finance lease existing under IAS 17 Leases (before the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases) as at December 31, 2019 were €23.5 million and €15.6 million, respectively. Please also refer to note 1.3.3 for more details on IFRS 16 Leases. 

 17.6.2. Reverse factoring

 Through the use of reverse factoring structures, the Group extends its payment terms up to 360 days, reducing its requirements for working capital. The contractual arrangements in place permit the supplier to obtain the amounts invoiced at agreed payment term with the amounts paid by the banks that participate in the reverse factoring structure. The Group will repay the banks the full invoice amount, with interest, on the scheduled payment date as required by the reverse factoring agreement. Based on the scheduled payment dates, the amounts payable under this arrangement are accounted for as current liabilities. As the amounts are payable to the participating banks, the amounts have been presented under Other financial liabilities. In the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the cash flows related to reverse factoring are presented under Changes in working capital for the movement in Trade payable and Other cash provided by financing activities relating to the net payment to the banks. The increase in reverse factoring as at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 is due to the combination of timing of reverse factoring capacity with the banks. 

 17.6.3. Accrued interest

 Accrued interest is the amount of interest due at balance sheet date regarding the Company’s outstanding debentures and loans from financial institutions. 

 17.6.4. Put options with non-controlling interests 

 The Group executes agreements with the non-controlling interests in certain acquisitions whereby the non-controlling interests have the option to sell their non-controlling interests to the Group. These instruments are measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date (please refer to note 19.1.2 for further information). 

 17.6.5. Mandatory Convertible Notes

 The Mandatory Convertible Notes (“MCN”) were issued for an aggregate amount of €2,055 million, which were


-----

###### entirely subscribed by the Company’s sole Partner, Altice Luxembourg S.A. These instruments are compound financial instruments that contain both a liability and an equity component. The non-current portion of the MCN liability recorded at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are €489.9 million and €586.9 million respectively.  The current portion of the MCN liability recorded at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are €139.9 million and €139.5 million respectively. 

 17.6.6. Debt and liabilities with Altice Group companies

 Debts and liabilities with Altice Group companies relate to debts and liabilities which Altice International has with Altice Europe group companies outside of the Altice International Group.

 17.6.7. Other

 Other consists mainly of various other debts and liabilities of the Altice Group. 

 17.7. Reconciliation of change in borrowings and other financial liabilities 

 Total borrowings and other financial liabilities increased by €728.0 million compared to the prior year largely due to the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases, which resulted in an increase of Lease liabilities for an amount of €876.0 million. The table below provides a full reconciliation of the movement in the balance sheet and a reconciliation to the cash payments as presented in the financing section of the consolidated statement of cash flows.

###### Financial risk factors

 In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to several financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk (including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) and other risks, including equity price risk. This note presents


-----

###### the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its financial risk and capital.

 Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. The Board of Managers establishes the Group’s financial policies and the executive management establishes objectives in line with these policies.

 The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

 18.1. Credit risk

 The Group does not have significant concentrations of credit risk. The credit risk may arise from the exposures of commitments under a number of financial instruments with one body or as the result of commitments with a number of groups of debtors with similar economic characteristics, whose ability to meet their commitments could be similarly affected by economic or other changes.

 The Group’s income mainly derives from customers in Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic. The Group regularly monitors its customers’ debts and provisions for doubtful debts are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which provide a fair value of the loss that is inherent to debts whose collection lies in doubt.

 Additionally, retail customers represent a major portion of revenues and these clients generally pay in advance for the services they buy, or in more significant regions, retail customers generally pay using direct debit, a practice that reduces the Group’s credit risk.

 The Group does not have significant concentration of credit risk, as a result of the Group’s policy, which ensures that the sales are mostly made under standing orders or via credit cards.

 18.2. Liquidity risk

 Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Managers, which manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserves borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

 The Group has a strong track record of driving operating free cash flow generation and specializes in turning around struggling businesses and optimizing the cash generation of existing businesses. As all external debt is issued and managed centrally, executive Directors of the Group have a significant amount of control and visibility over the payments required to satisfy obligations under the different external debts.

 Additionally, the Group has access to undrawn revolving credit facilities for an aggregate amount of €581.0 to cover liquidity needs not met by operating cash flow generation.

 18.3. Market risks

 The Group is exposed to risk from movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and market prices that affect its assets, liabilities and anticipated future transactions.

 18.3.1. Interest rate risk

 Interest rate risk comprises the interest price risk that results from borrowings at fixed rates and the interest cash flow risk that results from borrowings at variable rates.

 The Company has an exposure to changes of interest rate in the market, deriving from long-term loans that have been received and which bear variable rate interest.

**Interest structure of non-current financial debt** **December 31,** **December 31,**

**(€m)** **2019** **2018**

Financial debt at fixed rates 8,871.0 8,152.7

Financial debt at variable rates 1,863.0 1,853.4

**Total** **10,734.0** **10,006.1**

###### The Group’s proportion of variable rate debt decreased from 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 18.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to an increase in the total debt, which is largely explained by the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases as at January 1, 2019. When it can, the Group endeavours to issue fixed rate debt (which also typically offers longer maturities).


-----

###### The Group has entered into different hedging contracts to manage interest rate risk related to debt instruments with variable interest rates. See note 17.3 for more information.

 A sensitivity analysis was performed on the impact of an increase of interest rates applicable to floating rate debt: An Euribor/Libor rate increase by 1 percentage point would result in an additional annual interest expense of €17 million.

 18.3.2. Foreign currency risk

 The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk from transactions and translation. Transactional exposures are managed within a prudent and systematic hedging policy in accordance with the Company’s specific business needs. Translation exposure arises from the consolidation of the financial statements of foreign operations in euros, which is, in principle, not hedged. The Group’s objective is to manage its foreign currency exposure using currency forwards, futures and swaps.

 The Group estimates that a 10% variation of foreign currencies against euro parity is a relevant change of variables and reasonably possible risk in any given year. The table below provides the assessment of the impact of a 10% change in foreign currencies against euro on net result and reserves.

**Sensitivity to variations in exchange rates[1]** **December 31, 2019**

**(€m)** **Israeli Shekel** **Dominican Peso** **Total**

**Profit for the year**

**Equity**

Increase of 10% in exchange rate (85.1) (27.5) **(112.6)**

Decrease of 10% in exchange rate 85.1 27.5 **112.6**

**Sensitivity to variations in exchange rates** **December 31, 2018**

**(€m)** **Israeli Shekel** **Dominican Peso** **Total**

**Profit for the year**

Increase of 10% in exchange rate (12.2) (0.2) **(12.4)**

**Equity**

Increase of 10% in exchange rate (53.5) (24.4) **(77.9)**

Decrease of 10% in exchange rate 53.5 24.4 **77.9**

1 The Group enters from time to time into transactions for the acquisition of assets or enters into transactions which result in a liability. In
addition, the Group incurs from time to time expenses or recognizes revenues which are denominated in US dollar. The Group believes that
the foreign currency price risk of such transactions is limited.

###### Exchange differences recorded in the income statement amounted to a gain of €33.9 million (2018: exchange loss of €161.9 million).

 Additionally, the Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on the different debt instruments that it has issued over time. 

 The Group has issued a portion of its debt in US dollar, which is partially hedged to manage associated currency exchange risk. Debt which is denominated in US dollar and which is not hedged against foreign currency risk amounted to €1,411.0 million as at December 31, 2019 and €1,487.0 million as at December 31, 2018. A reconciliation between the nominal amount of the total debt measured at its balance sheet rate and the swap adjusted debt is presented in note 17.4.

 18.3.3. Price risk

 The Group has investments in listed shares that are classified as available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in respect of which the Group is exposed to risk of fluctuations in the security price that is determined by reference to the quoted market price. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying amount of these investments was €5.1 million (€5.5 million as of December 31, 2018).

###### During the year there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy. There are no non-recurring fair value measurements. The Group’s trade and other receivables and trade and other payables are not shown in the table above as their carrying amounts approximate their fair values. 

 19.1.1. Fair value hierarchy

 The following table provides information on the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, their valuation technique, and the fair value hierarchy of the instrument given the inputs used in the valuation method. 

**Fair value measurement** **Fair value** **Valuation technique** **December 31,** **December 31,**

**(€m)** **hierarchy** **2019** **2018**

**Financial Liabilities**

Derivative financial instruments Level 2 Discounted cash flows 207.8 392.3

Minority Put Option - Teads Level 3 Discounted cash flows 153.4 133.6

**Financial Assets**

Derivative financial instruments Level 2 Discounted cash flows 107.6 89.4

Minority Call option - Teads Level 3 Black and Scholes model 113.6 53.8

Equity instruments at FVOCI - Partner Co. Ltd. Level 1 Quoted share price 5.1 5.5

###### 19.1.2. Information on valuation techniques

 19.1.2.1.Investments in listed entities 

 Quoted prices directly available from an active market are used to source the fair value, i.e. the quoted share price of the listed investments in Partner Co. These valuations are directly observable in an open market and therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

 19.1.2.2.Derivative financial instruments

 Future cash flows are estimated using market observable data at the end of the reporting period (namely, forward exchange rates and interest rates) and the contracted rates of the derivative discounted at a rate that reflects the counterparty credit risk. Since model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management


-----

###### judgement, the Company has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

 19.1.2.3.Put options

 Each contract has specific terms and conditions, and the valuation is performed using the contracted terms and assessment against market comparable information where appropriate. For example, the exercise price in the option may be determined based on an EBITDA multiple minus the net financial debt. In all instances, the probabilities of the option being exercised is determined using management’s best estimate and judgement. The resulting fair value is discounted using appropriate discount rates of the related funding pool (4.5%). These models use a variety of inputs that use judgements not able to be verified externally, therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

 19.1.2.4.Call options 

 The valuation is derived by calculating the intrinsic value, being the difference in the value of the underlying asset and the options exercise price, and time value of the option, which accounts for the passage of time until the option expires. Various inputs are used, including the price of the underlying asset and its volatility (47%), the strike price and maturity in the contract, and the risk-free rate (ranging between -0.632% and -0.624%) and dividend yield (0%). The model calculates the possible prices of the underlying asset and their respective probability of occurrence, given these inputs. These models use a variety of inputs that use judgements not able to be verified externally, therefore the Group has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

 19.2. Level 3 instruments 

 19.2.1. Assumptions with management judgement used in fair value measurement 

 The instruments in Level 3 are the put and call options with the non-controlling interests in acquired entities. The valuation methods used to determine the fair value of these instruments include certain inputs that do not use publicly available information and therefore require management’s judgement. Those with significant impact on the fair value of the instruments concerned are deemed to be categorized as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Further details on these valuation methods and the associated inputs using judgements and which can have a significant impact on the fair value are presented below.

1 Permanent differences are mainly due to financial interests that are non-deductible, penalties (mainly related to gun jumping in Portugal,
please refer to note 30.1.1) and other non-deductible expenses.
2 Recognition of tax losses and variation in tax allowance line is related mainly to the reassessment of the realization of the net operating losses
and carried forward tax credit and the non-recognition of tax losses.

**Closing balance** **(19.0)** **63.5**

1 For 2019, the change in consolidation scope and other adjustments mainly includes a reclassification of a provision for tax risk to deferred tax
liabilities following the adoption of IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments.

###### 23.3. Net operating losses and carried forward tax credits

 Deferred tax assets related to carried forward tax credit on net operating losses expire in the following years:

**Variation in deferred tax balances** **December 31,** **December 31,**

**(€m)** **2019** **2018**

Within one year - 0.3

Between two and five years 5.6 0.8

Unlimited 241.3 224.2

**Net operating losses and tax carry forward, gross** **536.7** **501.5**

Valuation allowance (536.3) (303.4)

**Net operating losses and tax carry forward, net** **0.3** **198.1**

###### Net operating losses (“NOLs”) and tax carry forward as of December 31, 2019 were related mainly to holding companies as well as PT Portugal. The decrease in the amount of Net operating losses and tax carry forward net of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019 is mainly due to PT Portugal. The Group does not believe that the unrecognised deferred tax losses can be used given the Group’s current structure, but the Group will continue exploring opportunities to offset these against any future profits that the Company or its subsidiaries may generate.

 Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Group's future deductible temporary differences and NOLs. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is probable that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management takes into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Group may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income tax expense in the consolidated income statement. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, the Group recognised deferred tax asset on the basis of projections of future use of the loss carry forward deemed probable.

 23.4. Tax litigation

 This note describes the new proceedings and developments in existing tax litigations that have occurred since the publication of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and that have had or that may have a significant effect on the financial position of the Group.


-----

###### 23.4.1. Portugal

 MEO estimated the probable tax contingencies arising from tax audits carried out by the Portuguese tax authorities on various Group companies and recognised the appropriate amount of provision in its accounts according to its risk assessment as of December 31, 2019. The provision covers risks related mainly to the potential return of tax credits/incentives and VAT on indemnities charged as result of the breach of loyalty contracts entered with post-paid customers. The VAT contingency relates to both the fixed and mobile businesses and covers years since 2012. The claim for the VAT of the mobile company in 2012 was being discussed in an arbitral court, which decided to send the matter to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), that issued a decision on November 22, 2018 which was not favourable to MEO, concluding that, under certain circumstances, indemnities should be charged with VAT, and at the same time referring that ultimately VAT should only be assessed based on indemnities received from customers. The tax assessments of the fixed-line company in 2012 and both the mobile and fixed-line companies in 2013 and 2014, were submitted to the arbitral court as well, and all were suspended and waited for the decision of the ECJ. Following the ECJ decision, MEO was notified of the arbitral court decisions on the 2013 fixed and 2012 mobile actions, both unfavourable but both referring that VAT should only be assessed based on indemnities received from customers, which is less than 20% of the overall indemnities invoiced. MEO will be appealing from both these decisions to the Administrative Central Court. For the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 MEO reached an agreement with the tax authorities resulting in the payment of approximately €3 million. For following years, it is not certain that the tax authorities accept similar agreements.

 23.4.2. Israel

 On July 4, 2019, HOT signed a compromise agreement with the Israeli tax authorities for an amount of €7.6 million related to tax assessment for periods 2015-2016.

 23.4.3. Other tax jurisdictions

 Tax assessments are conducted in other tax jurisdictions within the Group (Israel and Luxembourg). The provisions recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the assessment of the risk by the management's and its professional advisors.

###### The net finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased to €372.4 million compared to €384.2 million for the same period in 2018. The decrease was mainly attributed to higher net foreign exchange gain that amounted to a €33.9 million gain for year ended December 31, 2019 (2018: €161.9 million loss) and finance income from the recharge of the fee on the guarantee facility agreement by Altice Financing to Altice Picture of €33.1 million (2018: nil), which were partially offset by:
 • lower realized and unrealized gains on derivative instruments due to lower gains in variation in the mark to market of the swaps of Altice Financing which amounted to €146.6 million (2018: €196.3 million gain); 
 • an increase in interest expenses related to lease liabilities that amounted to €74.2 million following the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases (2018: nil);
 • lower interest incomes recognized on loans granted to Altice Luxembourg and entities in the Altice Group that amounted to €111.3 million (2018: €193.3 million); and

###### Litigation 

 In the normal course of its activities, the Group is accused in a certain number of governmental, arbitration and administrative lawsuits. Provisions are recognised by the Group when management believe that it is more likely than not that such lawsuits will result in an expense being recognised by the Group, and the magnitude of the expenses can be reliably estimated. The magnitude of the provisions recognised is based on the best estimate of the level of risk on a case-by-case basis, considering that the occurrence of events during the legal action involves constant re-estimation of this risk.

 The Group is not aware of other disputes, arbitration, governmental or legal action or exceptional fact (including any legal action of which the Group is aware, which is outstanding or by which it is threatened) that may have been, or is in, progress during the last months and that has a significant effect on the financial position, the earnings, the activity and the assets of the Company and the Group, other than those described below.

 This note describes the new proceedings and developments in existing litigations that have occurred since the publication of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 and that have had or that may have a significant effect on the financial position of the Group.

###### 30.1. Portugal

 30.1.1. European Commission Investigation 

 After having approved the acquisition of PT Portugal by the Group on April 20, 2015, the European Commission initiated an investigation into infringement by Altice Europe N.V. (“Altice Europe”) of the obligation of prior notification of concentrations under Article 4(1) of the Merger Regulation and/or of the stand-still obligation laid down in Article 7(1) of the Merger Regulation. The European Commission issued a statement of objections on May 18, 2017, informing Altice Europe of the objections raised against it. 

 On April 24, 2018, the European Commission notified Altice Europe of its decision to impose upon it two fines totalling €124.5 million. The Commission found that Altice Europe infringed the prior notification obligation of a concentration under Article 4(1) of the EU Merger Regulation, and the stand-still obligation under Article 7(1) of the EU Merger Regulation. Altice Europe fully disagrees with the Commission's decision, and in particular, it considers that this case differs entirely from the French Numéricable/Altice France/Virgin gun jumping case, in which the Group had agreed not to challenge the allegations brought against it. In Altice Europe's opinion, the Commission's decision relies on a wrongful definition of the notion of "implementation" of a concentration. Further, the transaction agreement governing the management of the target during the pre-closing period provided Altice Europe with a consultation right on certain exceptional matters relating to PT Portugal aimed at preserving the value and integrity of the target prior to closing and was in accordance with well-established M&A market practice.

 In any event, Altice Europe considers that the elements in the Commission's file do not establish the exercise of influence, as alleged by the Commission, by Altice Europe over PT Portugal's business conduct neither prior to the merger notification to the Commission nor prior to the Commission's clearance.

 On July 5, 2018, Altice Europe filed an Application for annulment against the Commission's decision before the EU General Court to request that the decision as a whole be annulled or, at the very least, that the sanction be significantly reduced (Case T-425/18). The Commission's decision does not affect the approval granted by the European Commission on April 20, 2015 for the acquisition of PT Portugal by the Group.

 On November 6, 2018, the Council of the European Union filed an Application to intervene in the case before the EU General Court. Both Altice Europe and the European Commission confirmed they had no observations to the Council’s Application to intervene. The Council requested an extension of the time-limit to file its Statement of intervention. The Court granted that extension until February 25, 2019.

 On November 30, 2018, the European Commission filed its Defence requesting the Court (1) to dismiss Altice Europe’s Application and (2) to order Altice Europe to pay the costs. The said Defence was notified to Altice Europe on December 14, 2018. On December 20, 2018, Altice Europe requested an extension of one month to lodge its Reply. The extension was granted on January 4, 2019, until February 25, 2019. 

 On February 25, 2019, Altice Europe filed its Reply to the Commission’s Defence adhering to the conclusions and orders sought in its Application for annulment.

 On March 15, 2019, Altice Europe filed its observations on the Statement of intervention of the Council of the European Union, which essentially mirror the corresponding allegations in Altice Europe’s Application and reply to the Commission’s defence.

 On March 18, 2019, Altice Europe received the copy of the Commission’s observations on the Statement of intervention of the Council of the European Union, which merely state it does not have any observations, as its position and that of the Council of the European Union are aligned.

 After an extension of the deadline, the Commission filed its Rejoinder to Altice Europe’s reply on May 10, 2019.

 The written phase of the procedure has now been closed. The President will fix a date on which the Judge-Rapporteur is to present a preliminary report to the General Court. The preliminary report shall contain an analysis of the relevant issues of fact and of law raised by the action, proposals as to whether measures of organization of procedure or measures of inquiry should be undertaken, whether there should be an oral part of the procedure and whether the case should be referred to the Grand Chamber or to a Chamber sitting with a different number of Judges.

 Altice Europe submitted a reasoned request for a hearing on May 29, 2019.

###### On March 10, 2020, Altice Europe received from the General Court an invitation addressed to all the parties to submit observations regarding the possible consequences of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) judgment on another case by March 25, 2020. On March 25, 2020, Altice Europe lodged its observations and reiterated its submission filed on May 29, 2019, regarding the importance of a hearing in the present case. On March 23, 2020, the Commission and the Council of the European Union lodged their observations, which have been transmitted to Altice Europe on March 31, 2020. In essence, the Commission and the Council concluded by reiterating that Altice Europe’s application should be rejected.

 Depending on the Court’s evaluation of the observations received from the parties on the relevance of such judgment from the CJEU for Altice Europe's case, the General Court will decide whether or not to hold an oral hearing, which would most likely take place in 2020. In that case, Altice Europe would expect a judgment in 2021.

 As of December 31, 2019, a liability of €127.2 million (including accrued interests) is recorded at Altice Portugal, as it is the acquiring entity of PT Portugal. On July 25, 2018, the Group issued a bank guarantee to the European Commission of €124.5 million (excluding accrued interests).

 30.1.2. Vodafone – Network Sharing Agreement

 Vodafone and PT Comunicações (currently MEO) signed, on July 21, 2014, an agreement for the acquisition of exclusive rights of use of the PON Network, which consisted in the possibility of access to the installed infrastructure owned by each of the parties to offer new generation services and integrated offerings (voice, internet and television) autonomously in the retail market. On November 4, 2015, MEO informed Vodafone that it has decided to individually develop a new, ambitious plan for the expansion of its fibre optic network, both in geographical areas already covered by a new generation network and in other geographical areas, while continuing to comply with the agreed. Notwithstanding, Vodafone states that this was a breach of the agreement and is claiming an amount of approximately €132 million from MEO for damages and losses allegedly caused by that non-compliance with the agreed. 

 MEO submitted its defence to these claims in June 2018, stating that (i) Vodafone did not have a contractual right to prevent MEO from developing its network autonomously and independently from the agreement, (ii) all of Vodafone rights, resulting from the agreement, were respected by MEO, and Vodafone was in no way limited by MEO in the investment in the construction of its own network, which it developed freely and voluntarily, choosing to invest where it found greater profitability for its business, and (iii) Vodafone´s claims for damages and losses were not factually sustainable.

 An experts’ report should be submitted to the Court and the experts asked the Court for a 45 days extension for the report submission, so the report should be submitted in April 2020. MEO will wait for the notification from the Court for analysis and response with respect to the experts’ report.

 30.1.3. Optimus (currently NOS Comunicações) - Interconnection agreement

 This legal action is dated from 2001 and relates to the price that Telecomunicações Móveis Nacionais (“TMN”, PT Portugal’s mobile operation at that time) charged Optimus - Comunicações S.A. (“Optimus”, one of MEO’s mobile competitors at that time, currently NOS) for mobile interconnection services, price that Optimus did not agree with. TMN transferred to PT Comunicações (PT Portugal’s fixed operation at that time, currently named MEO) the receivables from Optimus, and subsequently PT Comunicações offset those receivables with payables due to Optimus. NOS argues for the annulment of the offset made by PT Comunicações and accordingly claims from PT Comunicações the settlement of the payables due before the offset plus accrued interest. In August 2015, the Court decided that the transfer of the interconnection receivables from TMN to PT Comunicações and consequently the offset of those receivables with payables due by PT Comunicações to Optimus were not legal and therefore sentenced MEO to settle those payables plus interest up to date in the total amount of approximately €35 million. MEO appealed this decision in October 2015 to the Court of Appeal of Lisbon. In September 2016, MEO was notified of the decision from the Court of Appeal of Lisbon, which confirmed the initial ruling against MEO, as a result of which MEO decided to appeal to the Supreme Court. On March 13, 2017, MEO was notified of the Supreme Court’s decision of dismissal of its appeal and as a result MEO decided to appeal to the Constitutional Court. In January 8, 2018, MEO was notified of the Constitutional Court decision of dismissal of the appeal, after which MEO appealed to the Constitutional Court Conference. MEO was notified that the Constitutional Court Conference did not accept and consequently will not analyse the appeal. In July 2018, MEO paid €41 million to settle the action which had been accrued for in 2015.


-----

###### NOS claimed an additional amount of interests during the judicial procedure and is now claiming an additional payment of €5 million. The contestation of the legal action by MEO was submitted and preliminary hearing should be scheduled.

 30.1.4. Anacom litigation

 MEO has several outstanding proceedings filed from Anacom, for some of which MEO has not yet received formal condemnations. This litigation includes matters such as the violation of rules relating to portability, TDT, the non- compliance of obligations under the universal service (public phones) and regulated offers (ORAC). Historically, MEO paid amounts significantly lower than the administrative fines set by Anacom in final decisions. The initial value of the proceedings is normally set at the maximum applicable amount of the administrative fine until the final decision is formally issued. 

 30.1.5. Zon TV Cabo Portugal – Violation of portability rules

 Zon TV Cabo Portugal (currently NOS) claims that MEO has not complied with the applicable rules for the portability of fixed numbers, as a result of which claims for an indemnity of €22 million corresponding to profits lost due to unreasonable rejections and the delay in providing the portability of the number. An expert indicated by each party and a third-party expert evaluated this matter and presented the final report to the Court, which decided to change the scope of the work to be performed by the experts, and accordingly the action moved back again. The experts presented the new final report to the Court in January 2019 and the parties are waiting for the appointment date of the preliminary hearing.

 30.1.6. Municipal taxes and rights-of-way

 Pursuant to a statute enacted on August 1, 1997, as an operator of a basic telecommunications network, MEO was exempt from municipal taxes and rights-of-way and other fees with respect to its network in connection with its obligations under the Concession. The Portuguese Government has advised MEO in the past that this statute confirmed the tax exemption under MEO’s former Concession and that it will continue to take the necessary actions in order for MEO to maintain the economic benefits contemplated by the former Concession.

 Law 5/2004, dated 10 February 2004, established a new rights-of-way regime in Portugal whereby each municipality may establish a fee, up to a maximum of 0.25% of each wireline services bill, to be paid by the customers of those wireline operators which network infra-structures are located in each such municipality. Meanwhile, Decree-Law 123/2009, dated 21 May 2009, clarified that no other tax should be levied by the municipalities in addition to the tax established by Law 5/2004. This interpretation was confirmed by the Supreme Administrative Court of Portugal in several legal actions. Some municipalities continue to perceive that the Law 5/2004 does not expressly revoke other taxes that the municipalities wish to establish, because Law 5/2004 is not applicable to the public municipality domain. 

 Currently, there are legal actions with some municipalities regarding this matter and some of the municipalities have initiated enforcement proceedings against MEO to demand the payment of those taxes.

 30.1.7. Invesfundo II - Disposal of plots of land

 Invesfundo II, acquired from one of MEO’s former pension fund assets, has a group of plots of land for a total amount of €41 million, including one plot of land that Invesfundo II argues was not MEO’s property, as a result of which Invesfundo II had to acquire that plot of land from a third party for €4 million, amount that is claiming from MEO. Judicial decision was totally favourable to MEO and the process was finalized in December 2019.

 30.1.8. Opway– Construction of Covilhã data centre

 In connection with construction of a data centre in Covilhã, PT Data Center had contracted Opway-Somague consortium as its main contractor responsible for the project, while Opway-Somague contracted Isolux as a subcontractor. Isolux filed an action against the Opway-Somague consortium for alleged delays in the construction works and changes to the initial project that resulted in higher costs for Isolux. The amount of this action is approximately €17.4 million. PT Data Center is only an accessory intervener in this action and thus no amount can be directly claim from it as a result of this action. Following the action filed by Isolux, the Opway-Somague consortium filed an action against PT Data Center in late 2016 for an amount of €16.7 million, claiming that PT Data Center orientations caused changes to the work plan and other vicissitudes in the realization of the construction plan that were never paid and caused damages to the Opway-Somague consortium. 


-----

###### By an extra judicial agreement between Opway and PT Data Center, closed in December 2018, with a broader scope than the facts that were being discussed in the judicial process, it was possible to close all the issues that involved the construction of the Covilhã data centre and the final reception of the contract took place. PT Data Center made a single payment, in face of the commitment of both parties that there was nothing more to claim from each other, and that they would desist from all legal proceedings.

 The process has been finalized since the beginning of February 2019, as the request by Opway to the Court for the process to be terminated occurred.

 30.1.9. National Commission for Data Protection

 MEO has several outstanding proceedings filed by the National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD), for some of which MEO has not yet received formal condemnations. This litigation includes matters such as the violation of rules relating to marketing contact with clients and alleged non-compliance of obligations under the database of debtors to telecom operators.

 Historically, MEO paid significantly lower (or even no amounts) of the administrative fines set by CNPD in final decisions. The initial value of the proceedings is normally set at the maximum applicable amount of the administrative fine until the final decision is formally issued. 

 30.1.10. Portuguese Competition Authority investigation

 On December 20, 2019, MEO has received a Statement of Objections from the Portuguese Competition Authority regarding its preliminary view that both MEO and NOWO, which operates as a MVNO using MEO’s network, were part of a cartel for market sharing and price fixing of mobile services, sold either on a standalone basis or in bundles of fixed and mobile telecommunications services. The Competition Authority concluded that this alleged illegal practice took place between 2017 and 2018. MEO firmly denies the existence of any cartel. 

 The maximum fine applicable for this kind of infraction corresponds to 10% of the turnover of each company in the specific markets that were impacted by the alleged illegal practices of both MEO and NOWO. In relation to MEO, such maximum fine amounts to approximately €52 million. On February 19, 2020, MEO has submitted its written defence to the Statement of Objections, after which the Portuguese Competition Authority will decide whether to issue a condemnatory decision and in that case the amount of the fine. The decision to impose a fine will end the administrative procedure with MEO having the possibility of challenging this decision in court. 

 Going concern

 As of December 31, 2019, the Group had net current liability position of €961.9 million (mainly due to trade payables amounting to €1,412.7 million) and a negative working capital of €258.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group registered a net profit of €438.9 million from continuing operations and generated cash flows of €1,363.6 million from continuing operations. 

 As at December 31, 2019, the Group had a negative equity position of €542.1 million compared to an equity position of €25.0 million as at December 31, 2018. The equity position decreased from the prior period mainly due to the net loss and Other comprehensive loss recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

 The negative working capital position is structural and follows industry norms. Customers generally pay subscription revenues early or mid-month, with short days of sales outstanding and suppliers are paid under standard commercial terms, thus generating a negative working capital. This is evidenced by the difference in the level of receivables and payables: €1,023.6 million and €1,412.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to €943.6 million and €1,210.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Payables due the following month are covered by revenues and cash flows from operations (if needed).

 As of December 31, 2019, the Group’s short-term borrowings comprised mainly debentures in Altice Finco of €257.5 million and loans from lenders for Altice Financing of €19.1 million. As of December 31, 2018, the Group’s short- term borrowings comprised mainly loans from lenders for Altice Financing for €18.8 million. The short-term obligations are expected to be covered by the operating cash flows of the operating subsidiaries. As at December 31, 2019, the amount drawn on the revolving credit facilities at Altice Financing amounted to nil. A listing of available credit facilities is provided in note 17.5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the amounts available per segments are sufficient to cover the short-term debt and interest expense needs of each of these segments if needed.


-----

###### Given the above, the Board has considered the following elements in determining that the use of the going concern assumption is appropriate:

 • The Group’s performance on Adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flows:
 Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to €1,547.7 million, a decrease of 4.2% compared to the Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018.  Operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 were €1,363.6 million.
 • The Group had unrestricted cash reserves of €395.5 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to €597.3 million as of December 31, 2018, which would allow it to cover any urgent cash needs. The Group can move its cash from one segment to another under certain conditions as allowed by the covenants under its various debentures and loan agreements. Cash reserves in operating segments carrying debt obligations were as follows:
 Altice International: €395.5 million.
 • Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, the Group had access to revolving credit facilities of up to €581.0 million, of which nil was drawn as at December 31, 2019.

 The Group’s senior executives track operational key operating measures (KPIs) on a weekly basis, thus tracking top line trends closely. This allows the Group’s senior executives and local CEOs to ensure proper alignment with budget targets and respond with speed and flexibility to counter any unexpected events and help to ensure that the budgeted targets are met.

 Altice Group continues to review its fiber infrastructure to further accelerate its deployment and is exploring financial partnerships. On December 12, 2019, PT Portugal signed an agreement with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners to create a nationwide fibre wholesaler in Portugal. PT Portugal will sell to Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners a minority equity stake of 49.99% in Altice Portugal FTTH based on an enterprise value of €4.63 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, on January 2, 2020, PT Portugal sold its 25% equity interest in the tower company OMTEL to Cellnex Telecom S.A.. The total cash proceeds were received in the first quarter of 2020 and amounted to €201.0 million. Furthermore, through the successful refinancing of Altice International in the first quarter of 2020, significant annual interest savings through both average cost and debt reduction are expected. 

 Based on the above, the Board is of the view that the Group will continue to act as a going concern for twelve months from the date of approval of the Consolidated Financial Statements and has hence deemed it appropriate to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements using the going concern assumption.

 Events after the reporting period

 32.1. Sale of a 25% equity stake in OMTEL 

 On January 2, 2020, PT Portugal sold its 25% equity interest in the tower company OMTEL to Cellnex Telecom S.A.. The total cash proceeds were received in the first quarter of 2020 and amounted to €201.0 million.

 OMTEL is the first independent tower company in Portugal and operated approximately 3,000 tower sites in the country as at December 31, 2019. The sale by PT Portugal of its 25% equity interest in OMTEL is part of a larger transaction pursuant to which Cellnex Telecom S.A. acquired 100% of the share capital of OMTEL. In September 2018, at the time of its sale of OMTEL to a consortium including Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and Horizon Equity Partners, PT Portugal had reinvested €108.8 million for a 25% equity interest in OMTEL. 

 32.2. Redemption of Notes

 The Group has undertaken the following redemptions of notes since January 1, 2020:

 • On January 13, 2020, Altice Finco redeemed in full the outstanding 2013 Altice Finco Euro Senior Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of €250 million, in accordance with the 2013 Altice Finco Euro Senior Notes Indenture;
 • On February 10, 2020, Altice Finco redeemed in full the outstanding 2013 Altice Finco Dollar Senior Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $400 million, in accordance with the 2013 Altice Finco Dollar Senior Notes Indenture; and


-----

###### • On February 18, 2020, Altice Financing redeemed in full the outstanding 2015 Altice Financing Senior Secured Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of €2,334.5 million equivalent, in accordance with the 2015 Altice Financing Senior Secured Notes Indenture. 

 32.3. Issuance of the 2020 Altice Financing Senior Secured Notes

 On January 22, 2020, Altice Financing issued $1,200 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% Senior Secured Notes due January 15, 2028, €1,100 million aggregate principal amount of 3.000% Senior Secured Notes due January 15, 2028 and €600 million aggregate principal amount of 2.250% Senior Secured Notes due January 15, 2025. 

 32.4. Amendment of 2014 Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement

 On February 20, 2020, all of the lenders under the 2014 Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement agreed to amend the 2014 Altice Financing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to extend the maturity date to February 20, 2025, reduce the margin and make certain other changes.

 32.5. Bridge facility 

 On March 3, 2020, Altice Finco entered into a term loan credit agreement providing for, among other things, a euro- denominated term loan in an aggregate principal amount of €500 million (the “2020 Altice Finco Bridge Credit Facility Agreement”). The term loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the weighted average rate of 2-month and 3- month EURIBOR for the period between the funding date of the 2020 Altice Finco Bridge Credit Facility Agreement (March 5, 2020) and the maturity date of the 2020 Altice Finco Bridge Credit Facility Agreement (May 29, 2020), plus the applicable margin of 2.5% per annum. The proceeds from the term loan borrowed under the 2020 Altice Finco Bridge Credit Facility Agreement were used to fund in part the redemption of the 2015 Altice Luxembourg Senior Notes.

 32.6. Update on the COVID-19 pandemic

 On March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic, highlighting the health risks of the disease. In this context and following regulatory requirements published by governments over the last weeks in the countries in which the Group operates, the Group continues to assess conditions in order to adapt to the business and social environment in which it operates. 

 The COVID-19 pandemic can have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations, depending on the nature and period of governmental measures in the countries in which the Group operates. Impact may include: 

 (i) the slowdown of the production capabilities of China or other affected countries may have a negative impact on hardware, software and other providers of outsourced services that the Group relies on to provide its services, and the global reach of the pandemic may lead to a situation where there are no clear or cost effective alternatives; 
 (ii) delay in infrastructural projects;
 (iii) productivity of the workforce may decline due to an increase in sick leaves, quarantine procedures and work or travel restrictions; and
 (iv) habits and financial situation of customers may change due to the economic slowdown and possibility of a worldwide recession, e.g., postponing purchase decisions, breaking contracts and personal or corporate bankruptcies.

 The Group has activated a response program in order to minimize the impact of this risk, by protecting employees, securing the supply chain, and continuously monitoring the situation and leveraging at the same time the Group’s services that may help in the virus containment efforts, such as videoconferencing and online classes. In addition, networks play a key role in keeping people connected and the Group is monitoring its network usage and assessing its policies and procedures to best support its customers.

 As of the date of issuance of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group is facing a decline in handsets sales (low margin activity) in the context of the closure of the shops in many countries where the Group operates and a decline in the advertising businesses (Teads) but the impact has been limited, since the crisis only began at the beginning of March 2020.


-----

###### The situation continues to evolve, including further regulatory requirements published by governments, and it is difficult to predict the effect on the Group’s operations and financial performance. Based on the above and information in note 31, the Group considers that the assessment of the going concern assumption for the Group is not impacted
